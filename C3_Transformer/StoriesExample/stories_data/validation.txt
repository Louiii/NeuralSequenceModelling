THE HILLS OF COMMERCE
  by Marilyn Hutchings
  
  The sun floated just above the trees -- a beautiful ball of red-
orange flame. I worried for a brief moment about the trees catching 
fire, but a cool breeze brushed against my cheek, assuring me that 
the trees were in no danger.

  I grinned thinking of all the superstitions that must have grown 
up around the sun when it turned that particular shade. But the only
thing I could think of was "Red sky at morning, sailor take warning.
Red sky at night sailor's delight."

  My mother had taught me that ditty -- along with the "Thirty days 
hath September . . . mnemonic device for the months. The two were 
linked in my memory.

  Memory. Memory is a funny thing -- contrary might be a better word 
for it. It will remember every slight ever done you, but won't let 
you think of the word, name, place, or number that you want right now 
-- you know what I mean.

  Maybe it's some kind of deeply hidden genetic memory that keeps
driving me to these hills. These hills where my mother grew up; and
her mother; and her mother.

  I really didn't know why I was trudging up this deeply rutted 
graveled path to see this old cemetery. None of my kin were buried 
here -- just a bunch of people named Anderson whose only connection 
to my family was the coincidence of living and dying in the same town.

  The cemetery was a jumble of different shaped and sized headstones.
Some had been installed fairly recently. These stood taller than me
and were still readable. Time, weather, and moss had not worn the
chiseled words down to the illegible ridges that remained on the short
round-topped tilting stone markers of the past century. Weeds had grown 
up between the markers, obscuring the shortest stones -- testimony to 
the inattention this little graveyard had suffered.

  "_The Anderson family must have had some money_," I thought, looking 
at all the markers, old and new. "All the Sanders' could manage were
large rocks at the head of the graves."  I envisioned the little 
graveyard on my cousin's farm that held the first two generations of
the Sander's clan in Missouri: big Maple and Pecan trees shading the
15 by 15 foot plot, two or three actual markers, and nine or ten large
rocks. No weeds grew up around these graves, for all that no one still 
living knew exactly who was buried here or where. My cousins made sure 
our relatives were well cared for.

  All the succeeding generations of Sanders were buried in Oakdale
Cemetery where someone came by on a regular basis to mow the grass and
pull the weeds. The majority of the graves had headstones, an American 
flag flew on a pole at the center of the cemetery, and the local VFW 
put little flags on the graves of veterans every Veteran's Day.

  This was an "active" cemetery. I remembered all the times through my
life that I had attended grave side services at Oakdale: my mother's
parents, my dad's father, several aunts and uncles, and, the latest,
my dad.

  Months had passed, after my dad's death, before I could visit his
grave. Now, I visited more often, but the grave I visited most was
that of a woman I had never met. She died seventeen years before I
was born, but I felt drawn to her --  To Emma -- my grandmother.

  I felt pulled to visit Emma. She had died young, of influenza, and
had been buried on one side of the cemetery while all the rest of her
family -- and mine had been buried on the opposite side. Not only had
she been separated too early from her family, but she was separated
from them for all eternity.

  This little cemetery, that I felt drawn to today, sat on top of a
hill, enshrouded in trees with a two-foot-tall iron fence protecting
it. The fence formed a circle around the graves and marker, like the
circle of life, but this circle only measured about twenty feet across.

  I think this place reminded me of the old grave stones that my Uncle
Dick showed me and my dad one Sunday when I was a kid.

  My uncle led us into the woods in back of his house and we all 
tromped after him. All civilization had disappeared when we stepped 
into the woods. The trees and other vegetation were so thick that just 
a few steps past the edge you couldn't see my aunt and uncle's big two-
story white wood-frame house. I felt like we had stepped back to pre-
Civil War days when my great-great-grandparents had moved from the hills 
of Tennessee to the hills of Missouri to homestead 90 acres and raise a
family.

  We wound through trees and up and down hills until my uncle 
stopped and pointed. I looked in the direction he indicated at the side 
of a hill -- deep in gloom from the thick tree cover even at midday -- 
and saw the first rounded tombstone that looked like it had started 
tumbling down the hill, but had been frozen in mid tumble.

  We walked over to the area and suddenly the firm ground became soft, 
sinking with our weight about four inches, as we walked over ground 
turned up decades ago for the last resting places of these unknown 
people. I expected to see bones sticking out of the side of the hill, 
but I guess the local dogs and the other woodland animals had scattered 
those long ago. I felt sad that no one had cared for these graves -- 
that no one except my uncle, knew these markers were here.

  We didn't stay long.

  I looked out through the trees and noticed that the sky was turning 
the rose-pink of approaching dusk. I checked my watch just to be sure 
-- I had about an hour before dark. I looked toward where I thought my 
uncle's house had been and knew that I had to find out if those grave-
stones were still there after all these years.

  It took about five minutes to drive through town to the bottom of the
hill where that white two-story house had once stood . . . before it
burned down. I took off into the woods, walking up the hill to take a
perpendicular course away from the house. I moved as fast as the dense 
underbrush would allow, glad that I had worn my jeans and my black short 
boots.

  After just a few hurried steps, I had to slow my pace. Fallen trees
leaned against living trees; I could climb over a few, and the rest I
had to skirt. Forced to slow my pace, I took the time to look around.
The hills around here supported a wonderful variety of trees: Maple,
Oak, Mulberry, Persimmon, and Sassafras. I wondered if either of my
grandmothers had ever made sassafras tea. 

  I know that Granny Wise used to take my mother along when she went 
out scouring the hills for Polk and Dandelion greens. A person could 
still probably live off the land around here. Oops! My foot had slipped 
on something round. I looked for what I had stepped on and saw the tough, 
round, green pod that protected ripening pecans. It's no wonder that my 
great-great grandfather had liked this area enough to move here from 
Tennessee.

  I looked up into the treetops as a squirrel jumped from one tree 
to another. The limbs of some of the trees were so close together that
they looked like a wooden suspension bridge. The local critters would
have a feast before too long, if the profusion of green pecans and
green persimmons that I could see decorating the upper-level bridge
was any indication -- unless some of the local human denizens still
ventured up this way.

  I stopped at that point and leaned against one of the larger trees 
-- looking at every hillside for evidence of a fallen headstone, a 
broken piece of stone, anything that would tell me I was in the right 
place. How I thought that after all this time I would be able to just 
walk right to the spot that I had only visited once was really stupid. 
I hung my head, ready to turn around and admit defeat. There probably
wasn't anything left to find anyway.

  I lifted my head slowly and took one long, last look around me. I
turned almost a complete circle, gazing at the woods, looking past the
trees, seeing wild ferns, Queen Anne's Lace, and other things that were 
probably poisonous, and just staring at one spot on the hillside, not 
really seeing it.

  Then my eyes focused. There was something irregular about the 
hillside. I took a couple steps toward it for a better look and sank
about four inches into the soil. I gasped and stopped. I had found it.

  I looked up the side of the hill and saw a couple other stones
sticking out. They were covered with moss and algae, but they were
unmistakably tombstones.

  I knelt down to see it any inscription was left on the stone. I had
pencil and paper in my pocket (I never went anywhere without it), but
time had taken its toll and erased this soul's record completely.

  I sat on my heels just contemplating the stones and the woods for a
moment. Dusk was settling in and all the leaves and all the tree trunks 
were turning to grey. I needed to start back so I wouldn't get stuck in 
the woods in the dark.

  As I rose to my feet, a movement just at the edge of my vision 
caught my attention. I turned to look, but there was nothing there. 
Another movement made me look back toward the hill. Mist was forming.
"_Great_," I thought. "_I really hate driving in the fog_."  The mist
spread out -- twining around the trees, climbing the hillside. And the
temperature had dropped -- I shivered with the cold.

  A piece of the mist broke away from the whole and drifted toward 
me. I took a step back -- away from the mist -- and sank again into the
soft soil. My heart beat faster -- I wanted to run, but my feet seemed 
to have put down roots. "Ah, come on, what am I afraid of -- a little 
water vapor?"

  The mist coalesced into a form. It was a little taller than I -- 
*she* was a little taller than I. Any composure that I had managed to
regain left me. I wanted to scream, but all of the moisture had been 
sucked from my throat and tongue -- my heart just beat even faster -- 
and louder. People in the next county could probably hear it.

  I stood transfixed as this mist-woman's features took shape. She had
a nice face -- heartshaped -- and short hair. She wore a simple dress
that reached almost to her ankles. She would have been right in fashion 
with some of the 30's dress designs I had seen. But she wasn't really 
taller than me -- she just happened to be floating about a foot off the 
ground.

  I looked back at her face. She had sad eyes. I wanted to ask her 
why she was so sad. Geez!  When had I changed from terrified to
compassionate -- I was looking at a ghost!

  But she had my grandmother's face. A face I had only seen in very 
few photographs. But here stood my father's mother -- who had died when 
he was just a teenager. I wanted to touch her; I wanted to talk to her;
I wanted to get to know her.

  Movement behind her drew my attention away for a moment. Behind her
were men -- in uniforms -- Civil War uniforms -- walking around. Lots 
of misty figures were walking all around me. They were all shapes and
sizes. None of the others seemed to have features that I could see.
They were moving in closer and closer to me. This wasn't interesting
anymore. I turned to run. 

  But the ghost of my grandmother was there in front of me holding up 
her hand -- not to me but to the others. All the other shapes stopped 
moving for a brief moment then began moving away from me. The shapes who 
appeared to be in uniform began to file past us, and as they did, each 
one would salute us. Why they were doing that, I don't know -- it didn't 
matter. In her pictures, my grandmother had always looked shy -- perhaps 
she had found courage in the next life.

  She motioned for me to follow her and I did. We climbed the hill 
where the tombstones were and then followed the hill down 'till I was
looking out through the trees at houses that were in town.

  I took a moment to realize that the house directly across from me 
-- across a small field and on the other side of a road -- was where my
great-aunt Sally had lived. That meant I was behind the lot where Emma's 
home had been.

  I looked over at her image and wished we had some other means to
communicate.

  She led me back through the woods, pausing and pointing at plants and
at the Pecan and Sassafras trees. She must have roamed these hills, too, 
as my other grandmother had done, looking for plants and nuts and berries 
to supplement her family's meager larder.

  I suddenly realized that it was completely dark except for the faint
lightness of the misty creatures that were still slowly moving around.

  "I'll never find my way back to my car," I whispered to myself.

  My grandmother moved and I jerked my head back toward her. She
reached her hand out, brushing her fingertips against my cheek. It
felt like a cool, damp spiderweb. Then she motioned for me to follow
her.

  I didn't know where we were going, but I didn't want to lose the
contact I had established with her. When she stopped, I looked to
where she pointed and saw that we were at the edge of the woods where
I had entered, and I could see my car in the moonlight.

  I turned back to thank her, but she was already moving away -- 
dissipating as she went. Right before she completely disappeared, a 
tall man's figure joined her that looked like my grandfather . . . and 
then they were gone.

  I turned toward my car -- tears streaming down my face.

  I'm not sure how I got back home -- I don't remember the drive back 
from the country. And now that I was back in town, the whole thing had a 
certain unreal air about it. It had really happened . . . I kept telling
myself that . . . over and over.

  I went into my apartment, greeted my cat and sat down on the couch
with a book. I flipped through and came across the letter Chief Seattle 
wrote to the governor to whom the chief's people had just sold their 
land. His words jumped off the page at me, and instead of being a threat, 
they were strangely comforting:

      "Your dead  cease  to love  you and  the  land of their 
       nativity  as soon  as  they pass  the  portals  of the 
       tomb and  wander way  beyond the stars.  They are soon 
       forgotten and never return.  Our dead never forget the 
       beautiful world that gave them being . . . these shores 
       will swarm with the invisible dead of my tribe, and when 
       your children's  children think  themselves alone in the 
       field, the store,  the shop, upon the highway, or in the 
       silence of the pathless wood, they will not be alone...."

Startrek... the Ultimate  S T O R Y !

Good Morning. My name is Mister Spock, Science officer of the
USS Enterprise, collector of rare Antarean tentacle flutes,
lead singer with the Sex Phasers, promulgator of interspecies
harmony and holder of the Vulcan boy scout in logic, second
class. This is my day:

     I am woken up by the Captain reading his log over the
P.A. at stardate 6:30 am. We're supposed to get a lie-in on
Sundays, but as there's a pre-credits crisis going on we'll
be racking up some overtime this month. The Enterprise is
stranded in the hole in the middle of a giant space doughnut
that needs our dilithium crystals for sugar frosting. By
five to seven, the Captain has confused it with a speech
about the essential good nature of humanity, complete with
extensive footnotes from the American constitution. It goes
away in disgust and I go back to bed.
     Get up at 11:30am, dial a breakfast of coffee,
croissants and a bowl of martian slime-warts washed down
with a quart of exotic Klingon Panther-Piss. I decide not to
bother shaving my eyebrows. I put on the stupid plastic ears
that Starfleet forces all its Science officers to wear &
crawl down to the bridge for another fun filled exciting day.
It's quiet. We're only on Yellow alert. Which is just as
well, I couldn't handle that stupid siren going Whoop-Whoop
this early in the morning.
     It seems we've come across a planet that shouldn't be
there, so all the important members of the crew, plus three
security officers from the Disposable Dork section, beam down.
The ship if left under the sterling command of Tibbles, the
ship's cat. Since all the Captain does all day is play with
his swivel chair and sing 'The Star-Spangled banner', the cat
makes an ideal substitute.
     On the planet's rocky surface, which my highly sensitive
instruments tell me is 20 yards square and made of plastic
(though I don't tell the Captain this), Kirk realises that
he's forgotten to put his ridiculous track-suit bottoms on and
goes back to the ship to get them. By the time he returns, the
three disposable dorks have died mysteriously, and bloody
McCoy has had the chance to say "He's dead, Jim!" three times.
     I'm always offended by the way people call ME Jim. Of
course, my Vulcan first name is unpronounceable, but does
anybody call me up and say: "Hey, Unpronounceable, how about
we cruise the space port, have a few Rigellian beers and get
laid?" No, its always: "Mr Spock, why don't you let your ears
down for a while ?"
     The Captain gets back. The planet is inhabited by a
vicious man eating-monster, a beautiful girl in glitter make-
up and an alien who dresses up in historical costumes left
over from some other series. This week, it's the Sheriff of
Nottingham, a primitive Earthling who liked to rob the poor
to feed the rich - so I understand. The Captain quotes more of
the constitution, gets off with the girl and kills the monster
while the rest of us sit around looking worried and putting on
our toenail polish.
     We beam back to the ship, have a little joke and all fall
about the place as we are zapped by Klingons.
     The little console in the corner that's supposed to shoot
out sparks when we're attacked shoots out sparks. (I've been
trying to get Starfleet to put in seatbelts for years).
     There's an entire Klingon battle fleet out there
determined to cream us because Captain Kirk got Klingon
Imperial High War-Bastard Krudd's daughter pregnant.
     "The dilithium crystals wonny take any more of this
Cap'n," says Mr Scott over the intercom. "The hamster that
works the little wheel that runs the impulse engines has died
of a heart attack, och aye, the noo, hoots mon." I don't know
why he pretends to be Scottish (as the Scots became extinct
seven centuries ago), but I expect it's go something to do
with the fact that he's an ex-Nazi interplanetary arms dealer
from Tau Ceti
     We asked the ship's computer what to do and it replies:
"You're such a smart-ass, pointy-ears, you figure it out."
Death is inevitable. However, I figure it out and we escape.
     I go down to the gym and practise my Vulcan combat moves.
I have just perfected the most deadly fighting move in the
universe - the dreaded Vulcan nose-pinch - guaranteed to get
you out of tight situations without having to use any
expensive special effects.
     Time for lunch in the Enterprise canteen - fish and
chips, apple pie and custard. And more bloody slim-warts.
Everybody laughs and tells dirty jokes I don't understand. So
I raise one eyebrow and slope off for a sulk.
     From 2 to 2.30 pm is my Vulcan rutting season, so watch
out. Yesterday I impregnated a stand-up ashtray. I have this
terrible urge to have sex with anything. The Captain calls by
for a friendly game of three dimensional chess......
     After we've finished our cigarettes, the Captain's mind
is taken over by an evil force-beam coming from a planet that
was colonised 300 years ago by unwanted TV gameshow hosts. He
forces Mr Sulu to dress up as a pink furry rabbit and tap
dance. Mr Chekov has to guess the price of the Enterprise in
roubles. He loses and is dropped in a vat of foam. I guess it
correctly down to the kopeck but am disqualified because I
refuse to sing "Nellie the Elephant" in Swahili backwards. I
suggest that as a solution, we kill the captain. I realise
there will be side-effects but I reckon I can live with them.
However, Murder proves unnecessary. After we blow up the
planet with a few photon torpedoes, the Captain returns to
"Normal".
     On the sub-space radio, we get a distress call from the
Federation colony on Planet Porn. The Captain paces up and
down a while, looks worried and asks Lieutenant Uhuru three
times to verify this. He has to repeat himself because
every time she turns to him in her swivel chair he gets a
chance to look up her skirt. Eventually, the Captain orders us
to proceed to the planet at Warp Factor 1. I'm constantly
amazed by the miracle of science that allows us to travel at
such frightening speeds. On a good day, Mr Scott can get as
much as 25 mph out of those engines!
     As we approach the planet, Kirk orders Mr Chekov to put
it up on the screen. "Aye Aye Keptin" say Chekov and the same
old football with blotchy bits painted on it flashes up in
front of us.
     Planet Porn is inhabited by men's magazine editors,
millions of attractive young women and a bunch of dribbling
photographers. Two thirds of its surface area is covered by a
massive ocean of beer. For reasons that are not entirely clear
to me, it is a popular tourist resort with male humans. We
make audio contact with the planet's chief administrator,
commander Randy Mackintosh, who explains the problem. They
have been invaded by a sinister race of intelligent marital
aids - vibrators are molesting the girls, the blow-up dolls
are blowing up beneath their owners and a huge amorphous mass
of strawberry flavoured joy-jelly is drinking all the beer. I
calculate that they will have taken over the planet completely
in 3.37485 hours precisely and everyone on the bridge throws
things at me for being a smart-ass. I further go on to suggest
that the logical way of dealing with this major threat to the
galaxy is to blow the planet to bits. But will they listen to
me? Oh no. I turn around to find that they've already beamed
down and that the Captain has left me a note saying that I'm
to get the Enterprise out of there and leave him behind if
he's not back by tea-time.
     Too bad. hey all get back in time having successfully
dealt with this threat to civilization as we know it. I
imagine that the Captain must have confused the sex aids with
dirty jokes from the American Constitution.
     In the evening, I go out and have fun, fun, fun at the
staff recreation room. We sink a few jars, do a little
differential calculus and all try to get off with Lieutenant
Uhuru. I get drunk and sing old Vulcan songs, such as "The
Pink Hills of Squidlblxx", "Four and Twenty Virgins Came Down
from Zuxccrnch", "My Baby was Partially Eaten by Romulans" and
"I Lost my Heart to an Organ-Bank Manageress". Everybody gets
fed up with this and Joe, the bartender, throws me out at
stardate five past three. I go back to my room, put on my E.T.
pyjamas, drop my ears into a glass of water and cry myself to
sleep.

                      How Ernie and Bert Came to Be

     You all know Ernie and Bert- they're those two puppet guys that live in an
apartment on Sesame Street.  You probably also have stayed up late at night
breaking into a cold sweat because you couldn't figure out how they were
related.  Most people(besides those k-k00l dooooodz who say "who cares,they're
puppets") say Oh, they are gay lovers.  Well, maybe, but if so, why do they
play with toys.  Fine, they are immature gay lovers.  No, because how do they
pay the rent.  They don't work, and don't own a car.  Plus, they sleep in
seperate beds.  They can't be roommates cuz they are just kids or demented
adults.  Now that you are thoroughly confused, I will help you sort it out.
     
     First of all, Bert is Ernie's father.  That's why they sleep in seperate
beds.  If you want, they can be gay and incestuous, but thats up to your sick
little imagination.  Anyway, Bert's wife was red. In case you don't remember
bert is yellow and ernie is orange.  Red and yellow make orange, hence ernie's
color.
     
     Bert worked in a factory for several years before he came to sesame
street(but why did he go to sesame street? - read on!) One day, Bert got just a
little too close to that machine that crushes steel girders into pellets the
size of a grain of salt.  His head was smashed, and he was brain damaged.  So
severely that he regressed to the intelectual level of a small child-a child
about ernie's age.
     When Bert's wife realized that Bert had become a moron, she divorced him
and took everything they owned (except that little brat Ernie).  Well, bert's
lawyer found out and sued the wife for everything she had.  Unfortunately Bert
and Ernie couldn't live alone so they were put into a community for the
mentally unwell.  You got it- Sesame Street.  They met Oscar, a wierd hairy man
obsessed with garbage.  Big Bird, a junkie and hallucinogen user  who always
thought he was being followed by a brown elephant-like thing called
Snuffalopagulopaloopulagus.  All the real people on sesame street are
counselors for the deranged folks who live there.  Why else would they be so
bloody nice all the time?  The real people kids are trucked in from nearby
towns to act as a positive influence on the patients.
     Well, thats it.  Years of research went into this, and it actually makes
sense.     Remember, this is only a theory!!!  It has yet to be proven, but I'd
like to see you find a flaw in it.

        SATURDAY NIGHT AT THE SHINDAR ENCAMPMENT
                       By Lucillus
             Dedicated to Balty and his boys
                                  
                                                                                                                     
Saturday night at the Shindar encampment                                                                 
Is like being nowhere at all.
They crawl in their bedrolls precisely at ten,                                
And the munchkins who live there are not seen again.                         
Just two drunken Romans who can't find their own tents                       
Sit by their fire in a daze (in a daze),                                       
And huddle together to share a last bottle,                                  
And wonder at strange Shindar ways.                                          
                                                                               
You ask how I know of the Shindar encampment                                 
Well, I spent a month there one day.                                         
They've got entertainment to dazzle your eyes:                               
Go watch the boys bauble and hear their shrill cries.                        
But don't go there drinking,                                                 
You'll live to regret it,                                                    
They're so much more boring to see (boring to see).                             
So take my advice on the Shindar encampment                                  
And learn to avoid it, like me!                                              
                                                                               
You might think if you hear the song that I'm singing,                       
That I hate the Shindar, but no!                                             
Your young, shining faces make life seem so new,                             
They remind of times when I felt that way too.                               
So despite the temptation                                                    
I won't make a judgement,                                                    
And call all you young kids naive (so naive!)                                   
Just remember instead that next time you judge someone                       
Things might not be what you believe.                                        
                                                                               
                                                                               
                                                                               
NOTE:
  You may have noticed that I have never sun ght third verse, and I have almost decided
to ditch it, since it doesn't really seem to fit in with the humorous tone of the rest of the song.
But I don't like people who preach at me, or are self-righteous about their beliefs, and I'm sure
you guys don't either, so I haven't sung it at you. Thank God for small favors, eh?

                       SAYED'S ADVENTURES

   Once upon a time, in the mysterious East, lived a man called Benezar who
married a woman called Zemira. They were in love with each other and agreed on
all things, except one. Zemira believed in magic, omens, premonitions and 
fairies. Benezar only believed in what he could see before his eyes. However,
that did not mar their happiness at all, and this reached its height, when, one
day, in the midst of thunderstorm, Zemira gave birth to a handsome baby boy.
When Benezar, who had anxiously awaited the arrival, was allowed to see the 
baby, he noticed a tiny whistle hanging from a thin silver thread round its
neck.
   "What's this?" he asked.
   "It's a gift a fairy made to our son," replied Zemira. "It's a magic gift.
Take it," she went on, removing the whistle from the child's neck, "give it to
our son when he is twenty."
   "All right. But listen, what are we to call the child?" asked Benezar.
   "Sayed," replied Zemira.
   The years went by and Sayed grew healthy, strong and brave. He was eighteen
years old when he decided to go on a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. He
told his father of his decision.
   "Yes, I'm pleased you're going," said his father. "In fact, Sayed, take this
as a lucky charm," and he gave him the fairy's gift.
   "What is it?" Sayed asked.
   "It's a whistle. Your mother, alas now dead, thought highly of it. Carry it
with you always."
   "I will father," said the young man, putting the whistle round his neck.
   Not long after, the travellers with a hundred camels, many merchants and a 
host of guards, set out on the journey. Young Sayed was splendidly equipped and
armed with a sword, spear, bow and arrows.
   It was a long, long way to the holy city of Mecca. They travelled over 
plains, mountains and deserts. It was on a long stretch of desert that they 
were attacked by a large band of robbers.The4y were caught unaware, some tried 
to flee, but Sayed shouted:
   "Flee? Where do you think you can flee to in the desert? Come on. Let's die
fighting!" and he hurled himself against the attackers. At the height of the
fighting, Sayed was attacked by a young robber,richly dressed and riding a
white horse. The young man bravely faced the attacker and killed him with his
sword. A soldier nearby shouted out,
   "What have you done? You've killed Almansor. This is the end, let's run!"
Men ran in all directions. Now practically alone Sayed remembered the whistle
round his neck. If it really was magic, it might be able to help him... he put
it to his lips and blew hard... But nothing happened. Not so much as a whisper
of sound.
   In the meantime, the others had fled. Sayed was taken prisoner, bound and 
led before Sheik Selim, a very powerful man, the leader of several of the 
desert tribes and, unfortunately, the father of Almansor, the very man Sayed
had killed. Selim, however, was not an unjust man. When he discovered that
Sayed had taken Almansor's life in a fair fight, he refused to allow a hair of
his head to be harmed. Indeed, he set him free and entrusted the young man to
some travellers about to leave for far off Mecca, the holy city.
   Sayed thus found himself once more on his travels. However, one night, 
friends of the dead Almansor captured him.
   "Your master told you not to kill me," cried the young man.
   "We're not going to kill you. All we going to do is tie you up and leave 
you here in the desert. Thirst and the sun, or the vultures or the jackals will
do the rest. They, not us, will kill you!" And laughing cruelly, they rode
away. Two whole days went by. Sayed was on the point of death, baked by the
sun and with no water, when close by passed some travellers belonging to Kalum
the merchant. They came to his aid and saved his life.
   As he came back to his senses with the first sips of water, Sayed spoke:
   "May Allah reward you, Sir, for saving my life. What is your name?"
   "My name is Kalum," said the man, "but it won't be Allah who will reward me.
You are going to do that yourself. If I hadn't come along, you would have been
dead by now. And you are going to work for me until you have repaid that debt.
What is your name?"
   "Sayed," he answered.
   "Well, Sayed, get up and come with me." The young man went along with Kalum
and on the way discovered that he was a rich merchant from Baghdad, so that 
was the city in which he went to live. At that time, Baghdad was ruled by the
famous Caliph, Harun-el-Rascid, wise, valiant and loved by all. Kalum owned a 
big bazaar in the city and it was there that Sayed was put to work doing all 
the humble jobs.
   One day, a veiled woman came to the bazaar. Sayed was amazed when she said 
to him,
   "You're Sayed, aren't you?"
   "Yes," he replied in astonishment. "How did you knoe that?"
   "Tell me, have you still got the whistle round you neck?"
   "Of course!" exclaimed the young man. "You must be the fairy who gave it to
my mother. But what is this whistle for? I've tried blowing it, but..." The
woman interrupted him.
   "It will be of no use to you until you are twenty. Then it will save your 
life. Now tell me, what can I do for you?"
   "Help me to get home," Sayed replied. "I need lots of money for that,which
I don't have."
   "But you're brave and strong. You can earn it," said the woman, and she
explained that, every week, tournaments were held in the city, and 
Harun-el-Rascid, the Caliph, always watched them. The winners received rich
prizes. The veiled woman had weapons, armour and horses and she lent these to
Sayed. He took part in the tournaments and always beat the others, winning lots
of prizes, as well as Caliph's admiration. Sayed, however, never revealed his
name, but just mentioned that he was a horseman from distant Cairo.
   Now it so happens that the Caliph, Harun-el-Rascid, liked to wander through
the city at night, disguised as a beggar or merchant, to hear what folk had to
say about him. Not to spy on them, but to try and put right any mistakes he
might have made. Sometimes, he was accompanied by his chief minister. Well, one
night, as Sayed was going home to Kalum's bazaar, he heard shouts and the 
sounds of struggle. Four men had attacked to others in a dark corner. The brave
young man immediately came to the rescue by killing two of the attackers and
chasing the others away. When it was all over, the two victims thanked Sayed
and asked him,
   "Brave youth, what's your name?"
   "My name is Sayed," came the reply.
   "I'm Kalum the merchant's shop assistant."
   "Hmm," said one of the two men, "ypu seem to be more of a gentleman than a 
shop assistant. However, take this ring as a reward for what you did for me."
Then the other man spoke,
   "And this bag of coins. You've saved my life and you deserve it. Goodbye!"
And away they went.
   Sayed stood there with the ring and bag in his hand. With these he could now
find a ship and go home.
   Next day he said to Kalum,
   "I'm leaving. I shan't be working for you any longer."
   "And where are you going to?" asked Kalum.
   "Home!" answered sayed.
   "Home? But it's a costly journey, and with the wages I pay you..." Sayed
smiled,
   "Your pay certainly wouldn't take me far, but..." and he held out the bag,
"but this money will. Farewell!" However, wicked Kalum was not to be defeated.
He told the police Sayed had stolen a bag of gold. The young man was 
immediately arrested. The chief of police asked him,
   "Who gave you this money?"
   "A man I'd never seen before," was the honest reply. Sayed was judged a 
thief and sentenced to deportation to Thirsty Island, the home of the worst
kind of criminals. On the ship the young man thought to himself, "Well, I left
home two years ago, proud, rich and happy. Here i am today, twenty years old,
in the midst of these convicts, condemned to live and die an innocent man in 
prison!"
   During the night there was a terrible storm. Driven by the wind, the ship
was flung about by the waves until it crashed onto some hidden rocks.
   Only one man survived the disaster. It was Sayed. At the mercy of the 
waters, he groped for something to hold on to, but nothing came within his
grasp, until he suddenly felt his fingers touch the whistle the fairy had given
him. Desperately, he blew it... and a dolphin surfaced beside him, shaking its
head as though to tell him to get onto its back. Sayed clambered up and there 
found safety. He remembered the fairy had told him that when he was twenty 
years old, the whistle would save his life! The dolphin carried the young man
within sight of land.
   "Thanks, friend!" called out Sayed as he slid down from the creature and 
swam ashore. What a surprise awaited him! There was a military camp, soldiers
and war machines. Sayed was taken prisoner and brought before none other than
Harun-el-Rascid himself. The soldiers who had seized him said,
   "Sire, this man must be one of the convicts that survived the shipwreck."
   "Is that so?" Harun-el-Rascid demanded gravely.
   "Yes," replied sayed, "I did survive the shipwreck. But I'm not a convict."
And he explained how he had been reported to the police because of the bag of
gold. 'It was given to me," he went on, "by one of two men I saved one night
from being attacked by four robbers." Harun-el Rascid looked at the man sitting
beside him and then said,
   "Did the two men give you anything else?"
   "Yes, they did, this ring," Sayed replied, showing the Caliph the ring which
he kept round his neck with the whistle. Harun rose to his feet and exclaimed:
   "Young man, the two men you helped were my chief minister and myself! Go
free, but first tell me your name."
   "Sayed, Sire."
   "Sayed?" echoed the chief minister. "There's a man here in the camp called
Benezar, who is searching for his son Sayed." "It's my father!" cried the
young man. And it was his father. They hugged each other in delight.
   Since justice must be done in the world, evil Kalum was arrested and
imprisoned as he deserved to be...

 Volume One of a forthcoming series:

			       A Cool 3.7 Million
			...An Excursion Into The World of
			    The Stainless Steel Rat...


  I stood in line, as patient as everyone else, my filled out forms gripped
hotly in my hand.  There was 3.7 million credits being held (for the moment) in
the supposed safety of the vault here at the Planetary Revenue Service office,
and I intended to have every single millicred in my hot little hands within the
hour.

  After an interminable wait I came to the be second-in-line.  I assured myself
that I had all of my equipment by casually patting my various pockets.

  The ancient, waspish teller scowled as she asked, "Your forms please sir."
Then she expectantly extended a aged and wrinkled hand over the counter.

  "Yes is a matter of fact," I reply, letting the paperwork fall away to reveal
the bore of the immense .70 recoilless pistol in my hand, "bring me to the
vault."

  All of the alarms went off at once, and I heard the doors crash shut.  The
teller grimaced smugly.

  "Good for you," I said, with a broad smile that showed the broad expanse of
gleaming, needle sharp teeth I sported today.

  "Don't let a litle thing like that stop you from leading me to the loot."

  She chose that moment to faint.  People started to rush about in a cheerfully
agitated way and gun-waving guards began to appear, looking about
enthusiastically for someone to shoot, so I tripped the radio relay in my
pocket.  There was a series of delightful explosions all around the bank, from
trash cans where I had planted a variety of different gas bombs, followed by the
even more delightful screams of panicky customers.  I slipped on the gas tight
goggles and clamped my mouth shut so I was forced to breathe through the filter
plugs in my nostrils.  The combination of tear gas and sleepy-gas was almost too
much and for a moment I thought I might succumb too.

  I leapt dexterously over the counter and ran for the "safe." My trusty
laser-cutter made short work of the manifold locks, and I was in.

  There were a few guards inside, so I smiled and tossed a sleepy-gas grenade to
the nearest.  He caught it reflexively, and then slid to the floor with a look
of bafflement.

  The other guards barely had time to draw their guns before they too were
affected by the gas.  Someone had thoughtfully put the money in bags for  me, so
I hurriedly donned the uniform of one of the guards and grabbed the money.

  Leaving the vault, I exited the bank through the back exit, and found that the
same thoughtful someone who had bagged the money had towed my getaway car away.
Luckily for me, they left a nice armored car in it's place.  I climbed in, and
tossed a sleepy-gas grenade into the driver's lap.

  After moving him to the passenger side, I wheeled around the block, ditched
the truck, And removed the uniform, pointy dentures, wig and the pillow in my
shirt.	I then hailed a cab and rode with him for awhile.  After paying the
cabbie, I loitered about for a bit, hailed another cab, sped for the airport to
my waiting helijet and a glass of premium alcohol, at the expense of the
taxpayers, of course.

                        JULIA CHILD
Oh, isn't he just *marvelous*.  My next dish involves peanuts.
Unfortunately, the only peanuts I have on hand at the moment are those
little sacks they hand out on airlines, and I always have such a
*devil* of a time getting them open.  Could you help, Jules?
*There's* a good boy.
        [Ms. Child hands the bags of peanuts to the Buma, who
        struggles unsuccessfully to open one up.]
I'll be needing to melt some butter too.  Now where did I put the
flamethrower?  Ah, there it is!
        [The Buma bursts out of its skin and grows to twice its size,
        but still can't open the bag of peanuts.]
Actually, I was thinking of using incendiary grenades, but you just
can't get that fine control over the temperature.
        [The Buma tries to rip the bag open with its teeth, fails, and
        starts to throw a tantrum.]
How is it coming with the peanuts?
        [The Buma grabs Ms. Child's right arm and rips it off.  Blood
        spurts all over the place.]
Oh, dear.  Wasn't there a Saturday Night Live skit like this?  It
seems that Dan Akroyd fellow was prophetic in a way.  I'll just
shuffle over here and call an ambulance.
        [The Buma roars and rips her head off.]

                        DIRECTOR
Run for your lives!  The Buma's gone berserk!

[Cut to control room.]

                        PRODUCER [on the phone]
Hello?  Yes, I have a job for you, now!!

[Cut to a punk-rock bar.  Hordes of slam-dancing teenagers crowd the
stage.  The MC walks out.]

                        MC
And now, punkers and punkettes!  The moment you've all been waiting
for!  The First Lady of Punk!  The one, the only.... Piss!!

[The crowd roars as a punk-rocker girl with butch-brown hair comes on
stage with a mike and starts screaming lyrics at the crowd.]

                        PISS
Oy 'ate you lousy fockers!
Oy wish 'at you were dead!
Oy'd like to put big 'oles in your fat stinky 'eads!
Oy!  [boom-boom-boom] Fock you!
Oy!  [boom-boom-boom] Fock you!
        [Piss' watch beeps.  She holds to her face. To the watch:]
Oy!  Piss 'ere!

                        WATCH
Piss?  This is Wacky.  We've got a berserk Buma at the PBS station.

                        PISS
All roight!  Time to kick some arse!
        [To the crowd:]
Oy!  I'm outta 'ere!  Piss off!
        [Piss leaves and gets accosted by the manager.]

                        MANAGER
Hey!  You can't leave!  I paid good money for this show!
        [Piss kicks him in the groin.  High voice:]
But if you must go, I won't stand in your way.

[Cut to a horrendous traffic jam.  A redheaded policewoman directs the
traffic, making it worse.]

                        NINNY [pointing every which way]
Now let's see, my left is their right.  Or is it the other way around?
Do they drive on the left side or the right?  Or is it my left that
they drive on?  Which hand is my left, anyway?  I'm so confused.  Oh!
Look at the nails on this hand!  I need a manicure!
        [She holds her hand out to examine it, causing a fiery ten-car
        collision in front of her.  Her watch beeps.]
What's that, Wacky?  Berserk Buma?  I'll be right there!  Hmm.  The
traffic doesn't seem to be moving much.  Guess I'm not needed.

[Cut to an aerobics class.  15 huge, hulking women thunder up and down
while a black-haired girl named Leonard and her assistant direct
them.]

                        ASSISTANT
Say, Leonard?  About the floor?

                        LEONARD
What about it?
        [Several women smash through the floor, leaving really big
        holes.]
Darn it!  What did I tell you about trying to sneak out to the
restaurant on the lower floor!  You'll never lose weight this way!
        [Leonard's watch beeps.]
Yes?  Mm-hmm?  I'm coming.  Take over, Eileen, I've got other
business.

[Cut to a advanced data terminal.  Yet another girl looks at the data
while sipping coffee.]

                        CELIA
Oh, father.  Why did you leave me with such heavy responsibilities?
What is Genom Electric up to?  And why did that dunderhead brother of
mine make me decaffenated coffee?
        [Her brother enters the room.]

                        WACKY
Big sister?

                        SILIA
Yes?

                        WACKY
I've called the others.  They'll be here any moment.

                        CILIA
Good.  Prepare the van.

                        WACKY
Sure!  You feel like taking off your clothes?

                        SELIA
No, why do you ask?

                        WACKY
Oh, just wondering.

[Cut back to the station.  The Buma, having destroyed the sets for
Julia Child, MacNeil/Lehrer, and Wall Street Week, is now wreaking
havoc on the pledge drive, while the Station Manager scolds the
camera.]

                        DIRECTOR
Now you see the kind of crap we have to put up with!  If you tightwads
out there would pledge a few bucks, we could afford a real security
force!  But nooooooooo, that would cut into your budget for Ho-Ho's
and cola!

[The back of the studio smashes open, revealing four babes in powered
armor.]

                        SYLIA
Knight Foils!  We have arrived!

                        DIRECTOR
Uhhh, tell you what, why don't we listen to a little music and get
those phones ringing while I skedaddle my hiney out of here!

[A Musak rendition of "Tie a Yellow Ribbon" starts up as the battle
begins.  The girls attack the Buma with little success.]

                        LEONARD
Go for the head!

                        NINNY
Is that, like, the part at the top?
        [The Buma grabs her and flings her around, knocking phones
        across the room.]
EEEEEEEEEEEE!
        [The Buma lets go and she crashes into a wall.]
Oooooh!  I'll show you!
        [She fires her wrist gun.  The kick causes her to lose control
        and mow down the pledge-helpers.]
Oopsie.

                        PISS
Fock the 'ead!  'ere's only one way to deal with a man 'is size!
        [She runs toward the Buma.]
Balllllllll-KICK!!!
        [She gives the Buma a super-powered kick in the groin.]

                        BUMA [collapsing]
Oorg.

                        CILEA
Now!  PILE ON!!
        [The girls make short work of the Buma.]

                        DIRECTOR
Thank you!  Thank you!  Here's a check!  Well done!

                        SILLYA
Thank *you* director!
        [To the camera]
That's right, world!  Wherever berserk Bumas menace the world, the
Knight Foils will be there to stop them!

                        DIRECTOR
Would you care to make a donation to our pledge drive?

                        PISS
Fock your pledge drive!  Put Doctor Who back on, now!!

[Cut to the office of an evil-looking white haired gentleman.  The
plaque on his desk reads "Quincy C. Wright, President".]

                        QUINCY
Knight Foils, eh?  Hmm...  We may have to deal with this.
        [He hits a button on an intercom.]
Get me Brian Jar Mason.  Now.

[Cut to the Knight-Cave, er, I mean, Selia's house.  The girls and
Wacky lounge around and discuss the situation.]

                        LEONARD
Well, we made a pretty penny tonight.  What was the take?  Six million
yen?

                        SELLYA
That's about right.  Of course, since we always get paid in checks
made out to Knight Foils, that doesn't help much.

                        WACKY
Hey, I'm working on that!  You think it's easy getting a bank account
for a bunch of costumed mercenaries?

                        NINNY
We could show up at the bank in armor.

                        PISS
Yeah, an' if the fockers won't cash the check, we hold up the bank!

                        LEONARD
No, Piss.  That goes against Knight Foils Rule #1:  "Don't do anything
stupid."

                        NINNY
No, that's Rule #4.  Rule #1 is "Cover your ass."

                        LEONARD
I thought that was Rule #6.

                        PISS
'ere is no Rule #6.

                        SLYA
I think Genom Electric is up to something.

                        LEONARD
Like what?

                        CEELIA
I'm not sure.

                        PISS
Good enough for me!  Let's kill 'em!

                        NINNY
But that violates Rule #7:  "No murder without the consent of all
members"!

                        LEONARD
No, that's Rule #5.  Rule #7 is "Don't pick your nose in public."

[Leonard and Ninny walk home in the dark.]

                        NINNY
Thanks for walking me home, Leonard.  The streets are all dark and
scary and there's never a cop around when you need one.

                        LEONARD
I thought you *were* a cop.

                        NINNY
Oh, that's right!  I'll protect you instead, then.

[A girl runs up to Leonard.]

                        GIRL
Leonard!  Remember me?  I was your best friend in High School!

                        LEONARD
Kathy?  Wow!  Fancy meeting you!

                        GIRL
Yeah!  Well, I gotta go!  See ya!
        [She runs off down the road and is attacked and killed by a
        Buma.]
AARRGH!

                        LEONARD
Did you hear a scream?

                        GIRL 2
Ninny?  Hi?  Remember me?  We met at the Police Ball last week.

                        NINNY
Oh, yeah!  How are you doing?

                        GIRL 2
Oh, pretty good!  Well, I'm off!  See you later!
        [She runs off down the road and is attacked and killed by a
        Buma.]
AARRGH!

                        LEONARD
You know, I think there's a pattern here we're missing.
        [She talks to her watch.]
Wacky?  Where's Cilya?

                        WACKY
She went to her High School reunion.

                        LEONARD & NINNY
Oh, NO!!!

[Cut to a drive-thru burger joint. Piss drives through on her bike.]

                        PISS
Oy wanna double cheesburger, fries, and Coke!  An' fockin' hurry 'cuz
I'm fockin' hungry!

[Piss obtains her burger and eats.  She is approached by a
plain-clothes policeman.]

                        POLICEMAN
That hair!  That mouth!  You must be Piss!  I'm a big fan of yours!

                        PISS
Piss off.

                        POLICEMAN
Allow me to introduce myself.  I'm Peon, an officer of the Very
Determined Police.

                        PISS
VDPolice, eh?  Why should oy care?

                        PEON
Well, I've been very busy lately, fighting crime, beating Buma,
opening malls, that sort of thing.  I'm a big man on the force.  Can I
buy you dinner?

                        PISS
Wha' does this shi' in my mouth look like, moron?

                        PEON
Well, at least let me have your autograph.

                        PISS
'Ere's my autograph!
        [She punches him in the face and drives off.]

                        PEON
She touched me!  I'm in heaven!

[Cut to the house where Leonard's reunion is being held.  Cellea,
Leonard, and Ninny survey the wreckage.  The room is filled with
corpses, and the girls are the only ones alive.]

                        SILEEA
Oh, it was awful!  Every time I talked to someone, a Buma would pop
out of nowhere and kill her!  All my friends, dead!

                        LEONARD
How awful!

                        NINNY
EWWWWW!!  There's blood all over the place! YUK!

                        SELI-UH
Now I'll *never* be voted Most Popular!

[Piss comes running in.]

                        PISS
Oy!  I came as fast as I could!  'Ey!  Is 'at blood on the floor?!
All roight!  My kind of party!

                        SELLEA
We can't let this go unanswered.  There's only one thing to do.

                        PISS
Senseless violence, roight?

                        S'LEE-A
This isn't just for me.  It's for the entire Knight Foils
organization.

                        PISS
So we're gonna kick their arses, roight?

[Cut to Knight Foils headquarters.  Wacky is showing his friends nude
pictures of the Knights with a slide projector.]

                        WACKY
And here's Piss bathing in 10W40!

                        FRIENDS
Ooooooohhh!

[The door flies open and Celiah enters, causing Wacky to yelp and turn
the projector off.]

                        SELIAH
Wacky!  Prepare the van!  The Knight Foils are about to strike!

[The girls get into their suits.  We get to see Piss naked.  Gotta
have our quotient of T&A, you know.

The van speeds down the highway.  Those nifty crane things lower the
Knights' bikes onto the road.  Unfortunately, Ninny's bike is loaded
backwards, and she wipes out and has to catch up.

The four bikes head for the RCA building in Downtown New York, now
owned by GE.]

                        DOORMAN
Take your bags?  WAAH!

[The four bikes crash through the door into the lobby.  They switch to
humanoid form, ring for an elevator and wait.

Cut to GE Central Control, where Brian Jar Mason oversees the
operation.  Bumas run past him hurriedly while he toasts the occasion
with a glass of sake.]

                        MASON
Let them come!  Together we will celebrate the birth of SuperBuma, the
ultimate household appliance!  Ha ha ha!
        [A Buma runs into him and spills his drink all over him.]
Asshole!

[Cut to tastefully furnished hallway.  The elevator opens and the four
Knights and their moto-slaves tiptoe down the hallway.

Four Bumas in intern's uniforms burst into view, sprout swords and
attack.  The girls go at it but don't have much luck.]

                        SILEA
We need more room!  The quarters are too close here!

                        NINNY
Quarters?  Where?

[Ninny starts to search the carpet.  A Buma drop-kicks her down the
hall.

Cut to the set of Late Night with David Letterman.]

                        DAVE
You know, Paul, those GE executives are all a bunch of boneheads!
        [The battle bursts onto the set, trashing it.]
Hey Morty, I thought Stupid Buma Tricks was scheduled for *tomorrow*
night!

[Leonard unleashes a devastating volley, but the Buma survives by
picking up Paul Shaffer and using him as a shield, much to the delight
of the audience.  Piss tosses her Buma into the crowd.]

                        PISS
OY!  FREE BUMA!!

[The Buma screams as the audience eagerly tears him to shreds.  The
Knights bike out of the studio and the remaining three Bumas pursue.

Cut to the roof.  Leonard, Piss, and Ninny engage the Bumas while
Cillya is thrown off to the side.  As she gets up, an armored Mason
grabs her and squeezes her helmet.]

                        MASON
And now, we shall see.... urm..  And now, we shall see... (c'mon, you
sunuvabitch, open) And now, we shall see who you are!
        [The helmet pops open.]
Cylia Amana.  Just as I expected.

                        CYLYA
Yes, it's me.  I've been fighting ever since you killed my father!
All he was trying to do was to invent a toaster that you could really
set the darkness on, and you perverted his work into those evil
machines!

                        MASON
Celia, Sylia, Selia.  You just don't understand.  If the public were
to find out that the knobs on their toasters weren't connected to
anything, our stock would plummet!  He had to die!

                        PISS
Yeah, well so do you!

[Startled, Mason drops Seelia and whirls around.  The other three
Knights stand ready for action.]

                        MASON
You--!  How did you defeat my Bumas?

                        LEONARD
I tossed a copy of Blade Runner over the edge of the building.  They
went over like lemmings!

                        NINNY
It's their favorite movie!

                        MASON
Well, screw it!  I don't need Buma's to defeat the likes of you!  Not
when I'm wearing my Ronco 4-in-1 Mecha Armor!  It grinds!
        [Giant whirling blades come out and attack Piss' armor,
        damaging it.]
It blends!
        [A huge pair of egg-beaters pops out, grabs Ninny, whirls her
        around and throws her away.]
It juices!
        [Two big hands pop out and squeeze Leonards armor until it
        breaks.]
It even...MICROWAVES!
        [A big rod pops out, points itself at Cylea and hums.
        Suddenly, lightning arcs between Cilya and Mason.]
AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
        [Mason collapses and dies, electrocuted.]

                        LEONARD
What happened?

                        SYLEA
We are the Knight Foils, Leonard.  And as everyone knows, you should
never use a microwave on foil.

[Cut to later at the same place.  A VDPolice helicopter lands, and
Peon hops out.  Next to Mason's corpse is signed "Nite Foyls".

Cut to a cemetary.  Celiya lays flowers on a gravestone, wipes a tear
and walks away.  Piss lays flowers on a gravestone, wipes a tear and
walks away.  Leonard lays flowers on a gravestone, wipes a tear and
walks away.  Ninny lays flowers on a gravestone, wipes a tear and
walks away.  Seliya lays flowers on a gravestone, wipes a tear and
walks away.

Pan back to reveal flowers on half the gravestones, plus a huge pile
of flowers to which the Knights walk back to reload.  They've got
their work cut out for them.]

=========================================================================================
                                        New Story
=========================================================================================
                               SIX ABLE MEN  

   Once upon a time there lived a young soldier named Martin who had enlisted 
in the royal army to flght a war. The war was long but victorious and when the
King abandoned the enemy's territory and returned with his troops to the 
homeland, he left Martin to guard the only bridge on the river that separated 
the two nations.
   "Stay on watch on the bridge," the King ordered. "Don't let any enemy 
soldier go by." Days and then months passed, and the soldier kept his watch on
the bridge. He survived by asking the passers-by for food and, after two 
years, thought that the authorities had probably forgotten him. He then headed
towards the capital, where he would ask the King for all his back pay. His 
pockets were empty and his only possessions were a pipe, a bit of tobacco and 
his sword.
   A couple of days later he arrived in a valley where a stream crossed his 
path. A big man with hands as big as hams, large shoulders and a bull's neck 
was sitting by the stream. The man, who had a strangely soft and kind voice, 
asked him:
   "Would you like to cross the stream?" The soldier couldn't ask for more. 
The man effortlessly uprooted a huge tree and laid it across the stream. 
Martin offered the man some of his tobacco in return and when he found out 
that the man had nothing to do, Martin asked him to come along.
   "You'll see all the things we can do together!"
   They had just begun walking away when they met a hunter who was aiming his 
rifle at a faraway hill.
   "What are you aiming at?"
   "Do you see that cobweb on that tree on top of the hill?" the hunter asked.
"I want to get the spider!" The hunter shot and when the three men got to the 
top of the hill they found a big hole in the middle of the cobweb and no more 
spider. Martin had never seen anyone shoot that well and he asked the hunter 
to join them. 
   "Come with us and you'll be in luck!" The three men walked and walked until
they arrived at a windmill. The wheel of the mill was turning even though 
there was no wind. The men were puzzled but further up the road they found a 
fat man sitting on a tree stump. The man was blowing through one of his 
nostrils in the mill's direction. The fat man explained to the three amazed 
fellow travellers that his strength was such that he could sneeze up a 
hurricane. The soldier convinced him to follow them. As they approached the 
city, they were approached by a man who hopped about with his legs tied 
together.
   "Who tied you up?" they asked in unison.
   "I did it myself," the man, who was very young and very thin, answered. "If
I untied myself I would run as fast as the wind and would not enjoy the 
sights." And so it was that even this character, nicknamed Fastfoot by the 
others, joined the group. 
   But the surprises of that extraordinary day were far from over. A little 
man with a round face sat under a tree. He held his hat over his left ear. "If
I straighten my hat," he explained, "I will freeze everything around me." 
Naturally, everybody took his word for it and the stranger was asked to join 
the group. The bizarre company finally arrived at the city. A public notice 
was hung outside the city walls. The princess announced that whoever would 
beat her in a race could marry her. 
   The soldier dusted his uniform, cleaned himself up after the long trip and 
ran to the palace. He wanted to challenge the princess but said that one of 
his servants would run in his place. The princess accepted his challenge. The 
morning after, at the starting line, Fastfoot untied his legs and took off 
like a rocket. Each one of the contestants had a jug that had to be filled at 
a nearby stream and brought back full to the finish line. On his way back, 
Fastfoot stopped to pick a flower and after carefully setting the jug on the 
ground and realizing that the princess was still far away, he decided to lie 
down and rest for a while. Unfortunately, he fell asleep.
   Later on, when the princess caught up with him and saw that he had fallen 
asleep, she kicked down his jug and ran away. She was sure of her victory. 
From far away the sharp sighted hunter shot and hit a spot near Fastfoot's 
ear. Fastfoot woke up all of a sudden and saw the princess approaching the 
finish line. He quickly ran back to the stream, filled the jug and reached the
finish line as fast as lightning. The King was furious. He would never let his
daughter marry a miserable soldier.
   He invited the unsuspecting Martin to the palace. Martin told him about his
two years watching over the river, which made the King ever angrier. The King,
however, pretended to feel guilty and invited the soldier and his friends to a
banquet in a strange dining room. In fact the dining room was lined with iron 
walls and was built over a huge furnace. The King ordered his men to seal the 
dining room's door and to light the furnace. Then he proceeded to watch the 
slow death of the group through an unbreakable glass. The six men began eating
but suddenly felt the floor grow very hot, while the room's temperature 
rapidly increased.
   But Martin did not lose his head. He straightened the hat of the round 
faced little man and pretty soon they were all shivering from the cold. The 
King uselessly urged his men to throw more and more wood in the furnace, but 
the soldier and his fnends had found a remedy to the King's wickedness. No one
had ever come out of this torture chamber alive, but this time the King had to
accept defeat, even though he was still determined not to let his daughter go.
He offered the soldier a large sum of money as long as he gave up the wedding.
   "I will fill you a bag of gold and other riches if you forget the wedding."
   "That's fine with me," Martin said, "and I accept your offer but as long as
I pick the bag and the man who will carry it away." The poor King was unaware 
of the strength of one of the six friends. When he began filling the sack, all
of his gold was not enough to fill it. Martin and his friends were rich. When 
they left court, the King had become very poor.
   The monarch lost his temper and realized the soldier had fooled him. He 
called the army commander and ordered two battalions to chase Martin. "Bring 
them back dead or alive and at all costs!" Later on, the soldiers caught up 
with the six young men and surrounded them.
   "Give us back the gold and surrender," they demanded. But the fattest of the
men began blowing so hard that horses and soldiers were carried away. In just a
few minutes the wounded soldiers were scattered all over the plain and the
battalions were no longer a threat to the six extraordinary friends who 
continued their journey. 
   Then they divided the gold and jewels in equal parts and each one of them 
went his own separate way. Martin crossed the bridge where he had been on 
watch for so long without any reward and never turned back again.

	"You said we never do anything exciting," Jennifer said as she

    pulled on Rob's arm.  "Well come on!"

	Rob quickly reajusted his feet to avoid falling as Jennifer tugged

    him down her  street.  Jennifer's house, being comfortably sized and in

    the middle of a semi-wooded lot, was situated on a desolate, lonely road

    in their hometown.  The rest of the city, including where Rob lived, was

    mainly newer developments that were less wooded and imposing.

    Jennifer's street, about 1OOO feet long, had only five houses on it, all

    of which housed middle-aged couples who had found a place to settle for

    the years, and were deep set into their respective properties, which

    gave the street a very private and mildly exquisite flavor.  Jennifer's

    house was the second one on the left side of the street, a comfortable

    two-and-a-half-story brick home, with a gravel drive bordered by maples

    and a rose garden in the back, complete with sundial and flagstone paths.

    A beveled glass hex of a window at the top center of the house where the

    roof formed a point signified Jennifer's bedroom.
	
	As Jennifer pulled him past his blue Toyota, which was parked on the

    street, he remembered their conversation earlier that afternoon.

	"What do you want to do tonight?" she had asked him.

	"I dunno," he had said, "I really don't know anymore.  Just something

    exciting."

	She told him that she'd take care of it, and now she's dragging him

    down her street.  Taking a walk isn't exactly my idea of exciting, he

    thought.	

	"C'mon, over here," she said, eagerly skipping down the old road with

    more grace than any dancer he'd seen.

	"I don't have a choice.  You're DRAGGING me," he replied.

	"Oh, don't be such a baby."

	Her street bled into a busy State Route, and when they came up to it,

    she just ran across as if she'd rehearsed for days and it had become 

    second nature.  "Where the hell are you taking me?" he asked her.

	"Just wait," she said.  "You're too impatient."

	On the other side of the road, they stopped underneath an ancient elm

    which was grasping onto its last orange leaves with what appeared to be 

    all the strength it could muster.  The handiwork of Fall lay scattered

    across the area amid a sensless jumble of stone markers which Jennifer

    was silently pointing at.

	"Well, what are they?" he asked her.  He'd drove past this a thousand

    times before and never noticed what it was.  To him it had always been a

    small clearing across from his girlfriend's street.

	"Graves.  But there's no people here.  Just graves.  Kinda neat, huh?"

    A smile expulged from her face.  She looked happy.

	"What are graves doing here without people?"

	"Well you see," she explained, "when they built the road, which, by

    the way, was at one time the main highway, not just little Route 12, they

    had to move this cemetary.  Well they couldn't dig up all of the rotted

    coffins and move them so they just moved the stones over here.  And Dad

    says they didn't even lay them right, so that's why they're all jumbley

    like that.  We've never seen anyone come here to pay respects, either.

    Isn't this neat?"

	"Yeah.  It's neat all right, but it's definitely NOT exciting."

	"Well c'mon.  I'm not through yet."  She grabbed his arm.

	She dragged him past the rubble and against the top of a slowly

    sloping ravine.  The area was completely wooded and the ground was

    carpeted with a rug of yellow and orange.  There was forest as far as

    he could see, well past the fifty feet or so to the bottom of the

    valley, past the top of the other side, and travelling onward

    ad infinitum on both his left and right sides.  At the bottom of the

    valley lay a freshwater creek, about ten feet wide and having a depth

    ranging from one to thirteen inches deep.  Leaves dirtied its surface

    and stones jettisoned out from its depths.

	"You go up the other side," Jennifer told him, "and you'll hit the

    Baylab plant.  Down to the left about a mile, the valley disappears and

    the creek crosses through the city hall's backyard.  You know where

    that is, by the library?"

	"Yeah.  But I'm still not sure how they get to the Baylab plant."

	"Neither am I.  Maybe they live up there, and never leave."  They

    laughed. 

	"So what are we doing down here, anyway?" he asked.  "I mean, it's

    scenic and all, but --"

	"Just follow me," she said, once again pulling him along.  They turned

    to the right side of the creek, and so they were travelling south.  A

    sudden CAW-CAAW boomed through the valley, interrupting their five-minute

    silence and causing Jennifer to jump.  "Mating bird," Rob told her.

	They trudged along at a liesurely pace at the base of the creek, 

    stepping on rocks and patches of leaves for support.  After Jennifer

    finally reassured Rob with a "we're almost there," he jumped.

    "Look!" he hoarsely whispered in her ear.

	Some distance ahead they could see several figures, one all white and

    the others dressed predominantly in black.  Rob did not know what to

    make of them, and the few shouts that he thought he heard were

    unintelligible.

	"They look like Satanists," he said.  "The one in white has a baseball

    bat.  See it?  Let's get a closer look."  He inched forward a few feet.

	"No," she whined.  "Rob, this is scary.  I don't want to go."  Her 

    pleas went unheard as Rob walked closer, eyes squirming to get a better

    view.  Suddenly the five figures ran off, their legs pounding the ground

    and making the forest air reverberate.  "They're just kids," he said.

    "Don't worry."

	She led the way to the top of the ravine, where they found a well-

    worn path, as of one used for a toolshed.  "We're here," she said.

	They walked down the path, past two great slabs of granite, one on

    each side, which at one time were connected.  "Must've been one helluva

    glacier," Rob said.  The path bended to the left and they came upon a

    small stone bridge which held them up about ten feet above a tributary

    of the creek.

	"Quaint," Jennifer said.  "Like Hansel and Gretel picture books."

	Before he had time to answer, Jennifer's scream rang through the

    woods.  "What's wrong?" he shouted.  "Th-they're dogs.  Scared me," she

    said.  "They weren't kids.  They're dogs.  Look."  She pointed towards

    the wooded area by the creek, twenty feet below and four hundred feet

    distant.  

	Rob looked but could not see them.  "Where?"  he asked her.  "Over

    there," she insisted, finger not moving.  "Where, I don't see," he

    said.  As much as she sounded crazy, he knew that he cared about her and

    therefore did not doubt her.

        "Now they're gone," she said, "but believe me, I saw them."

	"Yeah, I believe you," he answered her.  "But it's going to be dark in

    a few minutes.  What do you say we head back?"

	"I'm not done yet -- the best is yet to come!" 

	"Go for it."  he said, sitting on the bridge and looking into the

    woods.

	"Turn around," she told him.  He held his breath and turned around.

	When he registered what he saw, he released his breath and uttered a

    whoop of amazement.  The tributary under the bridge ran into a still pond, 

    which he could tell from where he was sitting was stocked with panfish. 

    The path twisted off to the left, circled the pond, then ran off into

    the woods.  Beyond the pond area was a grassy clearing about the size

    of a university gymnasium, and on the other side a hill rose up about

    fifty feet, layered with the most magnificent terraces he'd ever seen,

    much more elaborate and breathtaking than any man-made wonder he knew.

    There must have been thirty of them in all -- some only a few feet wide,

    plain and utilitarian steps, and others, from what he could make of them

    from such a distance, were decorated with stones, flowers and shrubs.

    As a whole the hill was geometrically pleasing and a treat for the eyes.

    At the top of the hill sat a large white house.

	"Wow," he said.  "Who owns this land?"

	"The Dellagiers.  They live up there."

	"They must be rich."

	"They're millionaires."

	"How come I've never heard of them?  This isn't that big of a town."

	"They keep to themselves.  Mom first heard about them at the beauty

    shop, and yesterday afternoon I asked around and found out how to get

    here.  They live off of 12.  You know those two lanterns about a mile

    south of my house?  Well that's their driveway.  I heard that they used

    to be a real influential family, but they got old and their kids moved

    away and stuff.  Now they're just two old people living in retirement.

    And I guess this place used to be a lot nicer, but it got rundown over

    the years."

	"Jeez, think of the parties we could throw..." he said, dreamy-eyed.

    "Someday, Jennifer, someday.  I can see it already -- the fire, the

    volleyball net, complete refreshment bar, people crawling the place...

    Tell me it wouldn't be great.  Just tell me."  With that, they sat there

    and watched the sun set behind the house.

	"Rob?" Jennifer said in a worried tone.

	"What?"

	"It's getting dark.  Be real dark soon.  And we have to get back."

	A tingly feeling slid down his back and was augmented by her

    trembling, nervous tone.  He looked around himself, at the woods, the

    ravine, and the creeping darkness, and felt a sudden sickness.

	"Holy shit," he said, and stood up.

	Jennifer sat there.  Damn her, he thought.  "C'mon, get up!" he cried.

    She slowly stood up.  "We've got a long walk."

	"No shit.  So let's get going, please."  He took her hand and guided

    her through the path.  As they came to the graite rock, she whispered

    in his ear, "who knows who could be hiding behind those rocks.  Let's

    be careful."  "Shut up!"  Beads of prespiration became visible on his

    forehead.  He knew about the loonies that lurked the woods at night.

    This was no laughing matter.  Lord knows who could be in these woods

    with them.  And those damn dogs -- where had they gone?  Were they

    people after all?  "We can't go down there," he said in reference to

    the bottom of the valley.  "Follow me, we'll make a beeline for the

    top of the cliff over there."  He led her up the embankment in a

    diagonal route through a mound of broken boulders.  "Watch your step,

    and hurry up," he said, slipping on a rock, which made him quicken his

    pace.  When they reached the top, they saw a white house only twenty

    feet ahead of them, similar in design to the Dellagier mansion, but

    much smaller.  What kept them back was a fence, stretching from where

    they stood to an unseen destination in both directions.  A compost pile

    against the fence spilt its contents a few feet down the hill to where

    Rob stood.  "Damn!" he said, wrenching the filth in his hands.  "We're

    trapped!"

	"No, no, we're still by the Dellagier's property.  They've had the

    whole thing fenced in, we just got around it back by the bridge.  We'll

    just have to go back down and come up by the graveyard."

	"Jennifer, by the time we get down to the bottom it'll be pitch

    black."

	"Okay.  Let's just sit here all night."

	He realized the lack of choices the situation gave him.  "Alright.

    Then let's go."  He pushed off into the night, Jennifer following.

    "Just keep up, just keep up with me," he hissed.

	Thorns tore his face as he raced down the hill.  Was that another set

    of footsteps he heard racing towards them, or just his imagination?  He

    had the most convincing feeling that they were being followed.  His

    heart fluttered and the blood gathered around his ears.

	"Wait up, Rob," Jennifer pleaded.

	Rob ran for dear life.  Run, man.  Run like hell, he thought.

	Stumbling, his hands clawed the dirt for support.  Briars entangled

    their twisting vines in his hair and a cold breeze hit the back of his

    neck.

	He was sure that it was the Reaper.  Blue Oyster Cult oh God no.

	The hill became steeper and he pushed onward without letting up.  

    Soon a warm glow filled his eyes and he looked up at the streetlight.

    The evening traffic on State Route 12 was the friendliest sight he'd

    seen all day.  Looking back at the wooded graveyard, he saw Jennifer

    emerge from the underbrush, a disappointed look on her face.

	"Had ya goin', didn't I?" he asked her.

	"You!" she accused him.

	"Hey, let's jog!"  She took up the offer and they quickly raced back

    to his car, which they entered.  He sarted up the engine and said, "What

    does it look like, the mall?"

	"Yes, but look at yourself," Jennifer said with disbelief.  "Your face

    is cut up, your hands are dirty and you're covered with dirt and

    prickers.  I think you'd better clean yourself up first, Mister."

  The twin towers of the old mansion glowered down at him as he fled through
the blackness.	His churning steps were unsure, like a drunkard's.  Forty yards
from the house Jack felt a sudden, numbing cold hit the back of his neck.
Dense clouds filtered the moonlight, shrouding all sense of direction.	The
cold intensified.  Jack quickened his lurching march.

  Crashing free of the underbrush, he spied the Continental, its dead, useless
bulk astride the dirt road.  Nora was still there, inside...  =With the dome
lights on!=

  He stumbled forward, his hand slashing at the door handle.

  "Cut the lights!" he wheezed, the distant, hollow sound of his words almost
buried under the slamming crunch of the door.

  Dumbfounded, Nora just stared at him.  His head slumped back; his chest rose
and fell, then rose again, struggling to suck in air.  He flailed out at the
knobs but caught the dangling ring to the ignition key instead.  The chain and
gold disk with its embossed eagle snapped free and fell to the carpet.

  "Christ, Nora!  The lights.  Cut 'em!"

  Her hand shot to the dash, punching them into blackness.  She felt his body
shake beside her.  Her spine tightened.  "Jack!"she wailed.  "What is it?"

  Her eyes, adjusting to the darkness, watched as his head wagged haltingly
from side to side.  "Jack!  Tell me.  For God's sake!  What happened in there?"
Her voice rose a half pitch with each word.

  "Younger," Jack mumbled.  "He kept getting younger." Panicky beads of sweat
glistened under a fading ray of moonlight as they rolled down from granite
forehead to jutting, clean-shaven chin.  A trembling hand raked through black,
unruly hair.  "Horrible!"

  "What, Jack?  Who?" She had never seen him in such a state.

  "Him."

  "Him?"

  "In the house.  The old man.  He opened the door when I knocked, like he was
expecting me.  He asked me in, and in five minutes, had my soul."

  Nora shivered.  It wasn't Jack's words that upset her -- certainly they were
just rhetoric; rather, it was the incredibly sad look on his face as his eyes
pierced hers that started the first tripping of alarms.  Chills raced outward
from the sudden knot in her stomach.

  "He looked a hundred and twenty at least," Jack continued, "all withered and
wrinkled.  I said I was sorry to bother him at such an hour, but we had taken
the wrong road, lost our way, and ran out of gas.

  "'We?' thld man asked." Nora winced under Jack's mimicking falsetto.

  "'Yes,' I replied.  'My wife and I.'

  "'Come in,' he said.  'I'll phone for help.'

  "Leading the way, he asked me to please excuse the condition of the house and
then said something about getting us fixed up in no time.  I suddenly felt
uneasy; his words came out measured as if sound, not meaning were important.  I
couldn't tell you why, but I felt walls closing in on me.  My vision seemed to
narrow to where I could see only his face; then, just his eyes.  The back of my
neck prickled, and like a kid whistling in the dark I made some fool comment
about how I should have expected trouble:  'When one roams around the
countryside searching for a recycling depot, discovering that apparently your
automobile was also made from recycled aluminum shouldn't come as a total
surprise.'

  "It was a dumb comment.  I didn't intend to say anything more, didn't want to
make a =complete= ass of myself, but then, in an instant of disbelief, I heard
myself rattling on about how I was the newly appointed Assistant Undersecretary
to the National Reclamation Commission, Recycling Division; and about how a
single entry on the Plant Location List caught my eye:	the only depot with no
commodity details, no statements of tonnage capacity, not even a name, only a
general location thirty miles south of Washington; and -- his eyes soothed me,
seemed to encourage me to keep talking.  I couldn't resist -- about the last
ten year's worth of trip logs I reviewed which led me to the discovery that
each and every Field Rep.  who checked on the 'mystery' depot had resigned the
day after his return; and, finally, about how we were in the area and had
decided a quick check was warranted -- a quick check which turned into six lost
hours.

  "Eventually, I just ran out of words.  I couldn't understand why I had
babbled on so; I was just tired, I guess, and nervous.

  "A strange look washed over the old man's face.  The look was a mixture of
understanding and -- I misread it then -- of irony.

  "He grabbed my arm, and his fingers as they circled my sleeve were like
pincers of dry ice, blistering cold right through to my skin.  There was a
coldness in his eyes, too, and in the slow, deliberate way he nodded as if...
As if passing judgement on a bottle of hundred-year-old port.  For an instant I
felt numb all over, all the heat in my body drawn to that one spot where he
held me.  Before I could react and jerk my arm free -- before I was even sure
it wasn't just my mind playing tricks -- I was warm again.  The old man's face
seemed to blur for a moment, then clear.  I blinked, positive my mind =was=
playing some perverted game; a man in his eighties was releasing his grip and
waving me along.

  "Trying not to shake like a damn fool, I followed him into the foyer.  It was
the size of a ballroom.  Immense mahogany doors lined the left wall.  Between
each door was a piece of furniture, almost all covered with white sheets.
Toward the back of the room, a great stairway, like something from an old movie
set, spiraled up into blackness.  Every inch of its carpeting was covered with
white paper.

  "'Are you moving?' I asked...  Yes, I remember asking that.

  "'Soon,' the old man replied.  'Been ready for quite some time.  But...  Yes,
very soon.  Moving on, you =could= say.' Then he stepped to the phone resting
on the only uncovered table, lifted the receiver, and turned to face me as he
gave the number.

  "Oh God, Nora!"

  "Jack!  I'm here!" He seemed to be looking right through her.  Nora studied
him, her dark brown eyes missing nothing.  Jack's head and shoulders were
twitching in little shuddering spasms -- sometimes separately, sometimes
together.  And...  And didn't his hair seem lighter somehow in the dim light of
the obscured moon?  Cold dread took hold of her.

  "He kept speaking into the phone," Jack picked up as if forgetting he had
stopped, "and I kept staring at him as he talked.  I remember thinking how he
didn't look so very old after all, maybe only sixty or so; the light in that
musty foyer really wasn't very bright.  the air seemed to swirl -- light,
dark...  light.  Somewhere, I heard a clock tick and before it ticked again he
looked younger still.  The years seemed to peel in layers from his face; his
stooped body began to uncurl.  He stood erect.	I couldn't move, not a muscle;
I just watched, fascinated.  Then =she= came into the room."

  Jack stopped.  His breathing turned to slow sighs punctuated with short,
quick hackings.

  "She?" Nora prompted.  No answer.  She grabbed his shoulders and shook.  His
head just wobbled back and forth as if attached to some mindless mechanical
toy.  "Jack!" she shouted, panic in her voice.  "Please!"

  He looked at her, his eyes blank, empty of emotion.  she buried her head in
his chest.

  "His wife, I guess," Jack's voice suddenly lurched on.  "She was nothing but
a shriveled up little ball in a wheelchair.  As I turned and stared, she
reached down with a ragged, spindly arm and flicked the chair forward into the
light.	God, she was repulsive!  A squat gray frog of a woman shrouded in
decayed linen, her big, bubbled eyes filmed with yellow mucus.	Her voice
rasped and gurgled.

  "'Hurry!" she said.  'We must leave.'

  "'Patience,' I heard the man say.  His voice seemed so far away.

  "'No!' she insisted.  'The timetable has started.  We're next; if we don't
hurry, we'll lose our place and be returned to the end.'

  "He wagged his head at her.  'You worry for nothing,' he said.  'We will not
be returned.'

  "She snorted and pumped herself closer, her yellow eyes blazing and twitching
at me.	Her hands as they gripped the black rubber wheels...  I --" a cold
shiver racked through Jack's whole body -- "I couldn't tell if there was any
=flesh= covering them.	I turned back to the old man, but...  But he wasn't old
any more.  He was as young as I.  It was like looking in a mirror; he was my
twin, feature for feature -- only not really like in a mirror, not backwards."

  Nora felt the strange gurgles deep within Jack's chest.

  He charged on, as if struggling to win a race.  "He looked at me, smiling.

  "'It's cold outside,' he said.  'Have Nora wait in here.'

  "Then -- at that moment -- I knew.  I hadn't told him your name.  I swear!
His eyes bore down on me, hypnotic; I felt empty, unable to move.  Then I saw
it!  The phone cord, a foot long, was dangling free.  =Unconnected!=

  "'What do you want?' I screamed at him.

  "'I think you know,' he said, still smiling.  'And we all want to thank you,
all of you.  What you call recycling has always been a critical concept to us,
but always very haphazard, very discreet, and very time consuming.  Finally,
when you discovered a =similar= need, and when you government boys got into the
act -- publicizing, encouraging -- we decided to set up shop.  The timing was
perfect; business has never been better.  We particularly liked your recurring
slogan:  Don't Can the Majority -- Recycle!  We took that phrase as a welcome
signal and official license to plan for expansion.  Some of our new depots
should be ready soon.  By the way, if you've never seen a =real= majority, you
should catch the line behind us.' The bastard paused on that, and then =winked=
at me.	Continuing, he told me that, 'We even have a few of =our= majority,
your field men, running for public office -- to keep the ball rolling, so to
speak.' Finally, he hit me with the capper:  'Has anyone ever told you,' he
asked, 'that you're Presidential timber?' He finished with a chuckle and
another wink.

  Jack hunched forward.

  "For an instant I fought against his eyes, and for that one instant I was
free.  I turned...  Turned and ran."

  Jack's last words came in gasps and croaks.  Nora jerked upright.

  Fighting to keep her breath even, Nora squinted at the still form beside her.
The clouds obscuring the moon were just now beginning to pass.	As they moved,
her mind pounded repeatedly on one thought.  "Deliver us, God!  Deliver us from
this terrible place."

  She saw her husband and screamed.  He was a hundred years old!  His hair was
snow-white; his face hung in loose vertical folds and his arms, once muscled
and firm, were bone thin.  His breathing was shallow and faint.  Very faint.

  It stopped.

  "My God."

  A sound!

  Nora wrenched sideways, riveting her eyes to the house.  Her breath stuck hot
in her throat.

  The huge doors were open again.  Wide.  Silhouetted in the bright yellow
light, a tall, familiar, athletic figure slowly descended the steps; then,
almost floating, moved toward the car.

  The figure was pushing something.

  The something had wheels.

	Last night I was reading through some old net articles that I 
rather like (don't ask, I only have hard copies) and I ran across 'Fun 
with Faerie Dragons: A D&D Tale,' [ 7/8/88 ] by the Pakrat from 
Rutgers (Stephen Lignowski) who, alas, I believe we have lost to the 
real world.  Anyway, it reminded me of a very strange adventure I once 
put a group through; kind'a WFRP meets Toon.  Now, this was a 
one-session game while I was home on break, and these kind of games do 
tend to get a little silly, but this one got out of hand.  
	My memories of this are rather vague; I don't even remember 
the characters' names; so please forgive me if this doesn't flow quite 
as well as the shorts I normally post.  You probably won't be shocked 
when I tell you I watched the introductory screens to Castlevania the 
day before game.

That the necromancer wanted a young maiden was not the real problem, 
even though the town was having a hard time finding someone who 
qualified; they most certainly would not have handed some poor, young, 
innocent lass over to such a villain just to save the town from near 
total annihilation (or so they claimed after not finding one).  The 
problem was that they were too isolated to get help in time.  
	Stereotypically, they had to rely on a few local hunters, 
militia, and residents of the jail who had the courage (and on whom 
the mayor had leverage) to do the job.  Stereotypically, the job was 
to march down the to the keep on the peninsula, penetrate its 
defenses, and kill the necromancer.  (A few of the more intellectually 
inclined of the adventurers assigned to the task noted that coming 
back alive was not in their job description.) 

Our Heroes were puzzled no end.  The skeleton just stood their; 
occasionally turning his head slightly to keep an eye-socket on them, 
to be sure, but he never really moved.  
	The keep was a large, boxish affair set on the very edge of 
the sea.  Their obvious goal was a large tower that rose up out of the 
sea and was connected to the keep via a stone walkway that appeared to 
be enclosed.  The only explicit entrance to the keep was a central 
gate of large double doors.  The way Our Heroes wanted to enter was 
through a door on a balcony nearly ten meters above the gate.  That 
was well and good, but they could not agree on what to do about the 
headsman.  
	The skeleton in question stood atop a small knoll not too far 
>from the gate.  He was heavily armored and was leaning on a headsman's 
axe.  Beside him was a chopping block.  Our Heroes had done 
considerable scouting about the keep and the knoll, being less and 
less sneaky about it as time went on, but the headsman seemed to have 
no interest in anything they did.  Even now, as Bio and Zog stood 
before the gate, Bio swinging a grappling hook, the headsman did 
nothing more than watch.  
	Bio released the grappling hook; and dove for cover as it 
missed its mark and gravity took its toll.  
	"Why don't we just axe the gate?" asked Zog.  Dwarves are 
practical by nature, and Zog was in a hurry to get back to his cell.  
	Bio's second try succeeded, with the grappling hook catching 
on the stone wall of the balcony.  
	"What, and let the necromancer know we're here?" asked Bio as 
he waved the other three over.  
	"Oh, right!" snorted Zog.  "What the hell ya' think that 
thing's for?" he demanded, pointing at the headsman.  
	Bio ignored him.  "I'll go up first, followed by the sergeant.  
Hunter will be next, followed by Patricia, and then Zog."  
	Bio and Sarge made the balcony, but before Hunter had a chance 
to start up the rope, the door on the balcony opened; Bio and Sarge 
were quickly beset by several skeletons.  
	Upon hearing the battle, Zog immediately began hacking at the 
gate with his battle axe.  When he finally succeeded in knocking out a 
plank, he reached through the opening to grope for a bar; a skeletal 
hand clamped onto his wrist.  Caught off guard, Zog was slammed into 
the gate as his arm was yanked through the hole.  Recovering almost 
immediately, Zog pulled back.  After battering his antagonist several 
times against the inside of the gate, he freed his arm; the skeletal 
hand was still firmly clasped to his wrist.  Even as he pryed the 
bones off, the gate was opened from the inside.  

The battle on the balcony went well, as the skeletons were neither 
well built nor well trained.  The battle at the gate, being against a
half-dozen skeletons, would have gone well, too, had not the headsman
chosen that moment to come to life.  The trio at the gate shattered
all of the attacking skeletons, but when the headsman returned to his
knoll, none of the living were conscious.  

Bio dodged the gauntlet as it darted for his throat, its fingers 
extended like talons.  His narrow escape brought him little joy, 
however, as the second gauntlet, balled into a fist, connected 
squarely with his jaw.  As Bio fell to the bone-littered floor, Sarge
finally landed a blow on one of the elusive gauntlet-covered skeletal
hands.  
	"Die, gods damn you!" he screamed as he sent the gauntlet 
spinning down the corridor and into the wall.  The gauntlet fell to 
the floor, but was almost immediately up again.  Much to the relief of 
the living, it zipped around the corner, out of sight.  The second 
gauntlet did likewise, disappearing around the corner at the other end 
of the corridor.  
	Bio leaned against the doorway to the balcony to catch his 
breath.  "Hey," he said with sudden revelation.  "The fighting has 
stopped.  And the headsman is back on his knoll!  This bodes ill."  
	"Well, lets make our way down to the gate and see what we 
find."  
	"Okay, light a lamp or something."  
	"Ah, I thought you brought a lantern."  
	They looked stupidly at each other for a moment, then into the 
darkness of the keep.  Without a word, they started down the rope.  

Bio, Sarge, and a recovered Hunter stood atop the balcony.  Patricia 
was climbing the rope while Zog anchored the bottom of the line.  
Almost to her destination, Patricia slipped and fell.  Screaming, she 
plummeted towards a Zog, who was also screaming and scrambling hastily 
out of the way.  As she fell she got tangled in the rope.  Her fall 
slowed and then came abruptly to a halt; she was dangling by one leg, 
her face a span away from the ground.  Since she was still screaming, 
it was some time before she noticed that her boot was smoking.

Zog had joined the others on the balcony and together they were 
encouraging, berating, and insulting Patricia.  Finally the huntress 
summoned the courage to climb the rope.  Halfway to the top, the 
headsman animated.  Charging the gate, he cast aside his axe and 
leaped for the rope.  Catching hold of it, he swung into the keep,
then kicked out hard, causing himself to spin, all the while shaking
the rope violently.  Patricia screamed and hung on for dear life as
she swung and spun danced around.  
	"Pull them up!" yelled Sarge as he grabbed the rope and 
pulled.  "He's doesn't have his axe!  Pull them up!  Pull them up!" 
The four hauled on the rope, but the headsman quickly dropped to the 
ground, retrieved his axe, and returned to his knoll.  
	As they pulled Patricia over the wall, she collapsed onto 
the floor, still clinging to the rope.  

Torches burning brightly, Our Heroes descended the wide stairway into 
the main hall.  The bottom of the stairs faced the entrance, beyond 
which they assumed was the front gate.  No skeletons were in sight; 
however, the hall was not without bones.  A skull was perched on the 
bottom of the banister, facing the entrance.  The across the hall was
a gargoyle, which had apparently fallen (or been cast) from above and
landed on some poor unfortunate.  All the remained of the victim were
scattered bones.  
	"Boy, those gargoyles sure are heavy," the skull said 
conversationally as the first of the living set foot on the bottom 
step.  
	"Ahhhh!!!" Our Heroes replied in unison as a quarrel, an 
arrow, two swords, and an axe pointed towards the skull.  
	"Say, the back of my head is tingling.  You guys are pointing 
weapons at me, are you?" the skull asked suspiciously.  
	"Who, us?" replied Bio, hiding his sword behind his back.  
"'Course not.  Ah, you were saying?" 
	"Yeah, boy, talk about a headache.  I sure look a mess, don't 
I; all scattered about like that.  That liche never was much on 
housekeeping..."  
	"Liche?!!" 
	"Yeah, you'd think with all the skeletons he had romping about 
this place he would have given a few of them brooms."  
	Many a whimper came from Our Heroes, and more than one broke 
down and cried.  
	"Ah, you said there's a liche?" Sarge inquired.  
	"Hey, don't sweat it," replied the skull cheerfully.  "The 
necromancer got rid of him first thing."  
	"Small comfort."  
	"'Course, he's not much on housekeeping, either, always 
letting those Fimir come tromping through here."  
	"I'm leaving..."  

Bio walked into the small, circular room, heading for the spiral 
stairs in the center.  Suddenly a dragon's skull, still attached to 
its bony neck, appeared from under the stairs and lunged at Bio.  
Screaming, Bio fell back as the dragon's jaws chomped just short of 
him.  Again the dragon lunged and chomped, though it was held in check 
by the chain of its own vertibrae.  Again Bio fell back screaming.  
	The dragon's cold, eye-sockets stared at Our Heroes.  Again 
Bio fell back screaming.  
	"Hunter," Sarge called as he shoved Bio out of the way.  
Hunter stepped up to the doorway and leveled his crossbow.  
	Kachunk!  
	The dragon winced (as best he could) as the bolt bounced off 
his skull.  Quickly he retreated behind the stairs.  Momentarily, his 
snout and a single eye-socket could be seen as he peeked out of 
hiding.  
	"He must be attached to the stairs," observed Zog.  "You 
stretch him out and I'll chop him off at the base."  
	Sarge grabbed Bio and jumped into the room, circling to the 
right.  The dragon lunged, his jaws crashing together between Bio and 
Sarge.  Zog dashed into the room and left, leaping behind the stairs 
and swinging his axe at the anchoring vertibra with all his might...  

On reflection, the battle with the Fimir was actually a pleasant
experience.  Feeling one's blade bite into the living flesh of the
opponent was very refreshing (the ogre-ghoul did not count).  Thus it
was that, although his hair had been singed by fireballs, and Hunter
was dead, Bio was feeling quite chipper (relatively speaking) when he
stepped into the doorway of the room he was assigned to explore.  
	Then he saw the gauntlet.  
	It was above the door, a little off to one side.  It obviously 
had some scheme or another in mind, as it was carrying a coil of rope.  
Upon being discovered by Bio, the gauntlet glanced right, then left, 
then dropped the rope behind the door.  Attempted to appear 
nonchalant, the gauntlet polished one of its fingertips with its 
thumb.  After giving up on appearing innocent, it gave Bio what was 
obviously a shrug, then darted past him, out the door, and down the 
hall.  

At last they stood at the entrance to the tower.  Looking down, there 
was only darkness.  Looking up, the light shed by a few windows showed 
them a stair leading up to a hole in the ceiling.  Alas, the stair did 
not terminate at Our Heroes' feet.  At their level of the tower three 
stairways had at one time arched together, meeting in the center.  One 
led to the stair that spiraled down into the darkness.  One led to the 
stair that spiraled up to the room above.  One led to the doorway at 
which Our Heroes stood.  Stereotypically, the latter was missing.  
	"Well, that certainly looks stable," Zog said 
matter-of-factly, demonstrating both his understanding of stone and
his understanding of sarcasm.  
	"At least it will be easy to hook with the grapnel," Sarge 
said, indicating the nexus of stairs.  The other two nodded.
	Patricia was guarding the other end of the bridge, as she
refused to look upon the interior of the bottomless tower.  

"Uh, oh," Sarge muttered quietly.  Zog nodded in agreement; it was 
indeed a predicament.  Silently they agreed it was best not to tell 
Bio unless it was absolutely necessary; if the the gauntlet succeeded 
in untying the rope from the grapnel, he'd find out soon enough.  
	Sarge raised Hunter's crossbow and took careful aim.  
	Kachunk!  
	The bolt zipped past the gauntlet, which jumped in surprise 
and then dove behind the stairs, out of sight.  
	"What the hell was that!" screamed Bio, who was halfway across 
the rope.  
	"Ah, well, I hate to tell you this, but one the gauntlets is
trying to untie the rope," explained Sarge.  
	"Ahhhhh!!!!" replied Bio as he madly scrambled across the 
rope.  
	The gauntlet peeked over the stairs, then darted for the 
grapnel and began tugging at it vigorously, slowly working it towards 
the edge.  At that moment, its mate showed up, announcing its presence 
by jabbing Bio in the ribs.  
	"Yeow!" Bio screamed, letting go of the rope to grab his side.  
Instantly he was dangly upside down, hanging from the rope by his 
knees and desperately trying to keep the suddenly playful gauntlet at 
bay.  "Get away!  Get away!  Get away!" Then he saw what Sarge 
intended.  "No, don't!" 
	Kachunk!  
	Bio covered his head with his arms as the bolt whizzed by him 
and slammed into the gauntlet, sending it spinning away.  Risking a 
glance, Bio breathed a sigh of relief.  Pulling himself up, the
grabbed the rope.  Just then the other gauntlet freed the grapnel.  
	"Ahhhh!!!" screamed Bio as he arced down and slammed into the 
wall.  Loosing his grip, he fell the last five meters to the stairs, 
landing on his head, and rolled, unconscious, downwards for a full 
quarter-turn of the stairs.  
	"Hey, that'll work!" Sarge declared as he gazed below.  "I 
mean, if you're willing to risk the drop."  
	"Beats the hell out of the playing spider with those gauntlets 
around," replied Zog.  He cast about, but the offending bits of armor 
had vanished.  Just to be on the safe side, "You go first."  
	Sarge climbed down the rope, safely dropping the last several 
meters.  Zog followed, hitting the stairs with a thud, tumbling down 
the stairs and over the edge.  
	"Ah, little help here, please?"  Suspended by his fingertips, 
Zog discovered courtesy for the first time in his life.  

Miraculously, Bio was only dazed.  Single-file and weapons at the 
ready, the trio moved up the stairs, carefully passed the nexus, and 
charged the remainder of the way.  Sarge, first one through the 
opening, was greeted by a mailed skeleton wielding a two-handed sword.  
Its first blow sent the sergeant backwards and over the edge.  
	"Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!"  Splash!  
	Dazed, Sarge managed to get his feet under him and stand.  The 
water reached his chest, but he was given little chance to consider 
his surroundings or his luck.  
	"Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!"  Splash!  
	Sarge had moved out of the way just in time as another hit the
water.  Reaching out in the darkness, Sarge pulled Bio upright.  He
then fished around until he found both their weapons.  
	"You okay?" he asked, pushing a sword into Bio' hands.  
	Bio was silent for a moment.  "You know," he said calmly, then 
his voice began to rise, "that is probably the singular, most moronic 
question anyone has ever asked me!  Of all the...  Hey, what's that?" 
	A greenish glow filled the bottom of the tower, collecting 
near the bottom of the stairs and increasing in brilliance as the 
ex-liche brought together its spectral self.  At long last having a 
target for its pent up frustrations, its ethereal laughter filled the 
tower's cellar, drowning out the sound of combat from above.  With a 
gesture of its translucent arms, it brought forth its servants.  Four 
skeletons theatrically rose from the water.  
	Sarge had neither an interest in, nor the patience for 
theatrics; he shatter one skull before it had even cleared the water.  
Soon the spector was hissing impotently as Bio and Sarge reduced its 
minions to undead dust.  Using the spector's light, they then made the 
stairs and started up.  
	"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!"  Splash!!  
	Zog sputtered to the surface.  Standing on his tip-toes, his 
face barely cleared the surface.  
	"Zog," Sarge called to him.  "Find your axe and get back up 
here."  
	"Pttt!  Pttt!  Yuck!  What is this paste floating around here?
I swallowed some!" 
	"Never mind that, just get up here."  
	With that they started back up the stairs.  As Sarge reached 
the top, he again met the two-handed sword.  
	"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!" 
	As Sarge plummeted out of sight, Bio leaped into the room.  
His first swing took out the skeleton's left leg, his return blow 
shattering its skull.  
	"Diiie!!!" Bio screamed as he turned towards the interior of 
the room.  On the other side of a worktable stood the necromancer.
Next to him stood a skeleton, holding a bonebow at full draw.  
	"Oops."  
	As the arrow cleared the bow it split with a puff of magic 
into three complete arrows.  One took Bio in the left breast, one took 
him in the right breast, but, fortunately, the third missed him 
completely.  Unfortunately, he died none-the-less.
	Zog charged into the room.  Tripping over Bio saved him from a 
similar fate; only one of the four arrows that targeted him connected, 
piercing his mail and sinking firmly into his shoulder.  Undaunted, 
the dwarf charged.  The skeletal champion leaped over the table and 
met him with an otherworldly saber.  The dual was fierce, but Zog gave 
ground.  Slowly he was backed towards the opening.  Then, at a moment 
when Zog's defenses were down, the skeleton dealt him a vicious blow, 
slashing from low to high, cleaving the dwarf's face and sending him 
backwards through the opening.  
	As Sarge watched Zog plummet past him, he noticed that the 
dwarf was not screaming.  
	"Bummer."  

As his warrior battled the human, the necromancer was undecided.  His 
strength was rapidly dwindling.  He could summon another hero, or he 
could fly away through a window, but he was not sure he could do both.  
As he hesitated, his champion suddenly went down in a puff of dust and
a rattle of bones.
	"Oh, dear."  
	Looking up, he saw only death in the eyes of the invader; 
dealing with death on such an intimate level, he knew exactly what it 
looked like.  No time for a spell of offense or retreat, he turned and 
leaped into the window.  Reaching up, he grabbed the edge of the 
ceramic-tiled roof and clambered up.  

Sarge leaped to the window and was contemplating a method of safely 
reaching the roof when, amidst much clattering, the necromancer 
suddenly shot over the edge and plummeted, screaming, a hundred feet 
to the wave-battered rocks below.  
	"Hmmm, the roof must have ceramic tiles."  

After smashing every vial and bottle in sight, Sarge examined the five 
black caldrons arranged along one side of the room.  In four of the
five were somewhat faint images.  In one he recognized the landscape
at the front of the keep.  In another was the main hall.  Two others
showed one of the rooms that contained bodies of Fimir; however, they
were from different points of view and rapidly changed.  Then one of
the gauntlets darted into view and Sarge understood.  Picking up a
staff, he stirred one of the gauntlet-caldrons vigorously, observing
the affect in the other.  As one gauntlet looked on, the other spun
rapidly in place.  When Sarge stopped stirring, the gauntlet dropped
to the floor and flopped about.  Laughing, Sarge tipped over the
caldron.
	The contents of the caldron hissed and steamed as the slashed 
across the floor, eating away at the stone.  Alarmed, Sarge leapt 
away.  Glancing quickly about, he spotted a large chest near a bed.  
Not bothering to check for a lock, he brought his sword down on the 
top of the chest.  Quickly breaking it open, he was fortunately to 
find what he needed; rope.  Snatching it up, he jumped over the 
hissing and bubbling pool of gauntlet brains and charged down the 
stairs.  

Patricia was holding onto Sarge's belt as he groped through the 
darkness.  They had made it as far as the stairway into the main hall 
and, hand on the banister, Sarge as leading the way down the stairs.  
	Suddenly, his hand bumped into the skull, knocking it off the 
banister.  
	"Hey!" the skull exclaimed in surprise just before clattered
onto the floor.  "Ow!  Watch were you're going, will ya'?" 
	"Sorry."  
	"Ah, no problem.  I really can't feel anything, anyway."  
	Then Sarge remember the caldron.  "You can see, can't you!" he 
exclaimed.  
	The skull was silent for a moment.  "Yes," it said 
tentatively, recognizing from the statement that a request would be 
forthcoming.  
	"Can you lead us out of here?" 
	"Think about it," the skull replied caustically.  
	"If I carry you, can you guide us out of here?" 
	"Oh, sure.  Just come over here an pick me up.  No, here.  
Here, here, here, here, here, her-aah!" 
	"Sorry."  
	"Like I said, no problem.  I don't actually have eyes."  
	"Where to?" 
	"Where to?" 
	"Huh?  Oh, the gate."  
	"Turn right.  Okay, start ahead.  Okay, okay, doing fine..."  
	"Ouch!" 
	"Watch out for the gargoyle."  
	"Thanks."  
	"You're welcome.  Okay, a little to your left.  A little 
more...  Not that far," the skull as said Sarge walked into a wall.  
"Okay, now straight ahead..."  

The headsman would have furrowed his brow had he had one.  Something 
was definitely wrong.  He glanced at the bodies of the man and the 
woman.  No, they were quite dead.  Hmmm.  Turning his head farther, he 
looked up towards the tower.  Could it be...  
	At that moment the floor of the necromancer's room collapsed, 
sending all its contents to join the spirit of the liche.  
	Damn.  Then the headsman collapsed into dust.  

-- 

Those of you familiar with the workings of WFRP may have noticed that
the pcs did use one or two fate points.
	During the battle within the tower one of the players,
inspired, started in on a soundtrack common in many a Bugs Bunny
cartoon (up the stairs, off the ledge, up the stairs, off the ledge...)
It was hilarious.

=========================================================================================
William Slattery 76630,3416

                             PAINKILLER

Nurse Laurie Schroeder's hand rose in small jerks as if it were
surprising itself, each movement bringing the middle knuckle of her mid-
dle finger inexorably closer to the tip of her nose.

"You've had that knuckle all of your life," said a soothing,
pleasant, seemingly neverending voice beside her, "but I'll bet you've
never really taken the time to study that knuckle.  And that is your job,
your only job, the only thing I want you to do.

"As you look at that knuckle you'll see lines that meet, lines that
intersect, lines that dead end.  Even after you think you've seen all
there is to see about that knuckle, every once in a while you'll see
something new.  It may be a difference in color between the knuckle and
the rest of the finger, it might be a difference in texture....and each
time you see something different your hand will become lighter, the hand
will rise more and more into the air, and the knuckle will come closer
and closer to your nose...."  "Nurse!"

The shout and the howl of anguish following it jolted Laurie
Schroeder upright; it also caused Hartley McVey a painful spasm at the
site of his incision.

"I'm sorry," she said to Hartley.  He gingerly swung his legs and
feet back into his hospital bed and waved away her apology.
"You're a terrific subject, Laurie," he said.  "No harm done, and
don't worry about a thing.  I'll certainly be here for a while.  We'll
have another chance.  Maybe later, after you take care of Mr. Harris."
"Right," she said and twisted her upper lip into a face that spoke
volumes.  Three times Hartley had tried to hypnotize her, and all three
times Abbott Harris, two rooms away,  had broken the spell.  It was not a
matter of bad timing.  Any time would have been bad simply because Abbott
Harris never seemed to shut up.  "I'll be back when you get your Tens
unit anyway," nurse Schroeder said as she left.

 He'd almost forgotten.  The Tens unit.  If it worked, blocking
pain signals going to his brain with little measured jolts of its own
electricity, he might be able to reduce his use of pain medication.
Hartley looked forward to trying it.  Even if it didn't work, it was a
gadget, and Hartley loved gadgets.

"Oh my God, for the love of G-O-D, please.  Nurse!"

Attila the Hun would have melted, Hartley thought.
He looked over at Willie in the next bed.  Finally he was asleep or
seemed to be, and Hartley breathed as deeply as his staples allowed.  He
liked Willie, but Willie could be tiring...literally tiring.  Straight
out of a Dannon yogurt commercial, Willie was a 93-year-old Georgian who
could pace for hours while in barely decipherable English relive his
middle-age World War II exploits behind German lines and then suddenly
and limberly drop into a near lotus position while he explained the phi-
losophy behind execution.  Hartley was awed by the old man and unabashed-
ly envious.  Willie was "in" for a "tune-up" as he put it to put his 63-
year-old son's mind to rest by proving he didn't have anything wrong with
him.

Hartley had just had his gallbladder and a chunk of intestine
removed.  What was so annoying was Willie's inability to understand how
anything could go wrong in only 45 years.  He had a 122-year-old uncle,
he said, and Hartley believed him.  He also said his uncle still had his
gallbladder, and Hartley believed that, too.

"Oh God, nurse, oh, please...." Harris plaintively wailed, his plea
penetrating the entire east wing.  As usual, several visitors had left
the rooms of those they'd come to visit and begun to file by Hartley's
door to gather outside Harris' room; they were the unititiated.  Those
who'd on an earlier occasion raced to see if they could help the poor man
so obviously being mistreated by the staff no longer bothered.
"God..." the outcry muted abruptly.

Nurse Schroeder had arrived.

  Hartley looked at his watch.  It wasn't time for Harris' pain
shot yet, so Hartley figured he'd either wanted his pillow fluffed or had
run out of ice water.
"He noisy," Willie observed, still lying on his side, his eyes
closed.  Hartley wondered if Willie really had been asleep at all.  Or if
he ever slept.

"He is that, Willie.  I doubt Mr. Belski ever in his life thought
he'd be lucky to be in a coma."  Belski was Harris' rommate; theirs was
one of the more perfect matches made in Angel of Mercy administration.
"Mr. Harris is lonely," Willie said.

"Aren't we all."

"No," Willie said.  He'd accepted Hartley's statement as a ques-
tion.  "Most have somebody, even an enemy.  He has no time to make
friends, so he makes enemies.  Easier."

"Maybe if I get to be your age I'll be as smart as you," Hartley
said, meaning it.

"You won't get to be my age."

A spasm raced through Hartley's abdomen; Willie, of course was
right, Hartley thought, but he asked anyway: "Why not?"

"Because you keep saying maybe," Willie answered, and, his eyes
still closed, grinned exaggeratedly.

"I tell people things like that, Willie.  I make my living telling
people things like that.  It doesn't mean I have to believe them."

"People pay you to put them to sleep, yes?"

"Well that's part of it.  I also sell them crystals to help them
meditate and tap into their higher levels of self-awareness. All very
scientific."

Willie emitted a high nonagenarian giggle.

"You think you're a pretty good crook, huh?  Thief."

"I'm not a thief, Willie.  I resent that. There are many more
forces at work around us than you can measure with  yardsticks and
clocks.  At your age, you should know that."

"At my age I do know that."

"Well, then, even if the sciences of cards and crystals and medita-
tion are still a little crude -- we only entered The Age of Aquarius in
1975 -- that doesn't mean people can't benefit from them.  My clients
find...peace of mind.  That's not crooked, and I'm not a thief."  "Do you
believe in..." Willie just waved his right hand in circles.

What I believe -- or don't -- doesn't matter.  If they think a rock
will solve their problems and their problems are solved, who cares about
the rock?"

"You are right.  Total right," Willie said.  "That's your problem."

"Now what the hell does that mean?"

"It means that you are right.  You have troubles with English?  You
are right.  To be at peace is a wonderful thing -- the only big thing.
To make people be at peace is very good...very honorable.  The rocks and
the words, they don't matter; you are right, but you don't believe you
are right.  You really believe you are a thief."

Hartley sighed.  It wasn't time for a shot or a pill or even a meal
-- anything that would break up the day.  And save him from listening to
Willie, which became increasingly taxing as days passed, especially when
Willie was right or even stood a chance of being right.

Hartley had what he described as a "flexible" past.  Four years as
a New York City cop followed by eight years as a news reporter and
preceded by jobs ranging from bus boy to guinea pig for submarine escape
suit tests for the Navy in Antartic temperature water.  Interspersed with
a year as a hypnotist.  Flexible might not be the right word, but it
suited him.

Not a specialist in anything and having simply seen and done too
much, Hartley had carried if you can't beat 'em join 'em a step further
to joining them and being able to laugh at them.  Sometimes the laughter
was a little forced, but, for the most part, Hartley was satisfied with
his life.  In the relative lull, the only sounds those of sqeaky IV poles
and the occasionally murmuring intercom,  Hartley reflected on his past
and wondered is flexible might not simply be flippant.  There had been a
time he'd really believed he could make a difference in the world; he'd
even campaigned for Eugene McCarthy.  Gradually, though, the mileage had
built up on Hartley.  Husbands beating wives who'd gladly stab the cop
who tried to stop it, loonies proudly taking credit for blowing up
strangers, streams of dead kids or dead cabbies interspersed with jewelers
robbing themselves for the insurance.

One very tired, very rainy night on the curving driveway of the
Jacob Javits Convention Center as he stared into the trunk of an abandon-
ed car trying to figure out how many people were entangled in the bloody
mess inside, he'd realized the whole damned world was orchestrated, that
all these things were factored into the mechanism, and that as a cop he
was no more than one extra moving part.

Three, he'd figured.  Definitely six hands and only three with
watches.

It was an epiphany for Hartley.  He was not meant to fix things, to
make them right.  He was meant to do exactly what he was doing because
part of the Grand Scheme called for three dead people with six hands and
three watches to be in a car trunk, and another part of The Plan said
there had to be somebody around to count them.  He was not meant to fix
things because they weren't broken.

And in a world where everything is as it should be, what can you do
to bitch about it?

You write about it.

The newspapers and broadcast media didn't hold much interest for
Hartley -- without having to try them he knew working for them would
amount to no more than changing his place in The Mechanism.  But he had
good contacts throughout the media.  So, with a downtown buddy assuring  he
got a coveted New York City police press card, he set up McVey Fea-
tures.  He freelanced for everybody, took assignments from anybody, and
in violation of contemporary wisdom of the New York journalism scene,
prospered.

Within two years he'd hired a few NYU students to monitor the po-
lice radios, and when Frank Adderly had gotten tired of taking corpse
pictures for forensic and decided to join Hartley, McVey Features ex-
panded its services to providing art.  By his fourth year he was success-
ful enough to make the news and broadcast unions officially edgy -- which
he didn't want to do mostly because a lot of those people were personal
friends, so he backed off, hung around the United Nations, wrote some
samples, and pretty soon was stringing for English-language papers from
Dublin to Tel Aviv.

Then one night he and Frank walked into a foyer of a walkup in
Chelsea, had stood stock still and looked at each other.  Hartley sniffed
the air again.  So did Frank.

"Dead person," he said, and Frank agreed.

And so Hartley had had another epiphany -- or perhaps it was just
an obvious milepost.

When you can smell the difference between a dead human and a dead
cat, it's time to move on.

Hartley had moved on with a vengeance.  If he was destined to be a
moving part, then he would really move.  If he couldn't change the world
-- and by then Hartley truthfully wasn't sure he wanted to anymore --
then he was going to do his damndest to enjoy playing games with it.
And so was born Golden Grail Associates.

With the help (and inspiration) of a prudish nude dancer named Daf-
fodil and a lot of research, Hartley became the New Age wizard of the Up-
per East Side.  He tarot-ed 'em, hypnotized 'em and crystallized 'em.
And they loved it to well into six figures a year.  And that gave him
enough cushion to take a vacation whenever his clients were too happy
with him and he was in danger of taking himself seriously.

A problem he never would face with Willie, whose 93 years made him
too damned shrewd.

"Nurse Laurie, she wants to lose weight, right?"  Willie more
stated than asked, bringing him back to his bland beige room, his IV
tubes, his naso-gastric tube and the drain that dumped greenish black
gunk from his insides to a plastic bag dngling from the bed.

"Yeah.  About 20 pounds.  She'll look terrific."

"And with this knuckle thing you can talk her into losing weight,
right?"

"Something like that."

"Then your not a thief."

"Of course I'm not a thief. I told you I'm not a thief.  I'm not
even charging her!"

Willie cackled.  "Sure you charging her.  Your belly hurts, you get
your medicine quick, right?  You get it quicker than Mr. Harris, right?
Everybody charge everybody," he said and lapsed into deeper laughter.
Hartley rolled more onto his left side, holding his breath to allow
his freshly disturbed innards to settle.  He wished he could take a nap.
He wished the $3.50-a-day television had cable.  He'd have settled for an
orderly with a wheel chair cruising in to tell him he had a date with x-
ray.  Anything that would break up the monotony of the hospital day.  And
shut up Willie.

An attractive brunnette just then breezed into the room carrying a
small plastic case in one hand and a clipboard in the other.  "Mr. McVey?"
she called, and Hartley raised his hand.  The brunnette bounced over.
Hartley didn't miss the appreciative look she got from Willie.  "I'm
Jeannette from physical therapy," she said.  "I've got your Tens here."

"Good, I've been looking forward to this."

"You want to avoid drugs?  People are becoming very responsible
about avoiding drugs."  The shape of her neck made him want to respond to
the approval in her voice, but he just wasn't in the mood for a scam.
"Not really, Jeanette.  I just think that choosing to hurt when you
don't have to means your problems aren't limited to your gall bladder.
I'll take medication, electrocution or a sharp tap behind my left ear if
it will get rid of the pain."

"Oh."  Her disppointment at least skittered like a cirrus cloud
across a bright sun, to be quickly gone.  "You'll find it reduces your
drug dependence anyway."

Hartley appreciated the neverending human proclivity for finessing
feelings through choice of words.

"How's it work?"

"It's really simple," she said, opening the plastic case.  She took
out a cigarette pack sized box with three knobs and a bundle of floppy
rubberized discs dangling from wires.  She plugged the wires' other ends
into the device.  "The Tens send out rapid electical signls.  We think
they blocks pain signals; we're not completely sure.  They may also
stimulate the release of endorphins -- those are the body's own pain-
killing drugs."

"So nature beat Schering-Plough, huh?"

"This goes here..." she went on without responding.  She dripped a
sticky goo from a tube onto his abdomen and firmly pressed down an elec-
trode.  "And this one here..."  again some goo, with this pad being place
on the opposite side of the incision.  "Now, tell me when you feel some-
thing."  She began to turn knobs.

Nothing..twist...nothing...twist...YIPES!

"WHOOPS!!  Sorry.  That's a little too much."

Hartley swallowed and nodded agreement; the muscle between the
electrodes had twitched violently -- and hurt.

"Just how much juice has that thing got?"

"Oh, don't let it's size fool you.  It can deliver a lot bigger
shot than that."

"Great."

"Now, I want you to turn these knobs.  This one controls the in-
tensity, and this one sets the width of the pulse.  Changing that gives
you the feeling of changing the depth of the sensation.  Play.  Go
ahead."

Hartley did and in a short time was beginning to enjoy playing with
the thing.  He settled on a particularly "warm" and "soothing" setting.

"How's that feel?"

"Very pleasant."

"And how's the abdominal pain."

Hartley felt his eyes widen.  The damned thing worked.  The linger-
ing pain that even drugs couldn't abolish was gone.  "It's gone!" he
said.

Jeannette absolutely glowed.  "Sometimes you get used to a setting,
so you may have to adjust it once in a while.  Otherwise, that's it."
Hartley thanked her as she left and went back to playing with his
new toy.  Only then did he notice that Willie had been totally absorbed
by the demonstration to the point he'd not said a word.  "This could be a
very useful thing, Willie."

"Is nothing new.  The Germans once put wires on my balls and
cranked up a field telephone."

"Oh, I'll bet that really got rid of the pain."

"Sure did.  Hurt so damn much I passed out.  Felt nothing."

Then it was Wilie's favorite time of day.  Dinner was beef vegeta-
ble soup, turkey breast and candied sweet potatoes, green beans, bread,
butter, chilled peach halves.  Hartley liked the hospital's food, found
himself in a minority, and attributed that to the other patients' lack of
experience.  Cops and reporters lost their taste buds long before their
livers.

Willie absolutely loved the hospital food and told Hartley that the
cops and reporters should have been in eastern Europe in the early 40's.
Willie often reminisced, and Hartley sometimes became engrossed in the
old man's stories.  He was fascinated mostly, though, with Willie's reac-
tions to the horrors he'd seen -- and to some he'd inflicted.  Willie,
Hartley finally concluded, had been through flames that scarred the
psyche and unlike some men who stop there, destined to wear those scars,
Willie had gone on through flames which had scoured him clean again.
Clean, but changed.  Massive suffering had given Willie rare perspective.
"When you kill a man," Willie had once advised him, the advice
being unsolicited, "you must kill quickly and cleanly.  No matter who he
is.  Even if he is butcher who should burn in hell.  Hate does not belong
with killing.  You kill quick and you kill clean -- not for the man but
because death deserves that dignity."

When Willie said it, Hartley heard "death" with a capital "D."  The only
times Hartley thought he detected tremors in Willie's monologues were when
he talked of food and hunger.  Starvation didn't offer Death the dignity it
deserved in Willie's view.

Which gave food a place of unparalleled honor in Willie's pantheon.
Which also made eating beef soup, etc. in a hospital with Willie a unique
experience for Hartley.  He enjoyed Willie's unabashed delight in every
bite of everything and found himself starting to feel the same way; for
the first time in his life he'd eaten brussels sprouts.  They still
tasted terrible, but somehow that was all right because brussel sprouts
are supposed to taste terrible.  Hartley figured another week with Willie
would forever alter his diet, cause him to kill even flies with quick
clean swipes of the swatter, and probably make his friends consider him
even stranger than they already did.

"Nurse!" one...two...three..."Nurse!" one...two...three..."Nurse!"

Whatever problem Laurie Schroeder had handled just minutes before
had been supplanted by another.

The shouting went on and on.  Hartley felt his own stomach contract
with frustrating anger.  Harris had in record time alienated every
patient and staff member on the floor.

Voices penetrated the walls.  Nurse Schroeder obviously had arrived
again.  Hartley did not envy her her job.

"Some day they're going to poison him to shut him up,"  Hartley
said.  "A fast-acting poison," he hastened to add.

"Silly silly and you a policeman.  Too easy to find."

"Not if the person who did it is the person who decides what to
look for."

"You have good police here, Hartley.  They know to look closest at
people who make decisions.  You know this."  "And how would you do it?  You
can't ice pick him in his ear in a hospital bed either."

"No....Maybe..."

Nurse Schroeder came in.

"Dinner all right?" she asked.

"This is lovely," Willie said.  "Beans very good, turkey too."

Nurse Schroeder looked doubtful and glanced at Hartley.  "He means
that for canned beans these probably were canned better than any other
beans ever and that for dry turkey there is no tastier dry turkey.  That
about right, Willie?"

"Very right.  Same for canned peaches."

"It sounds like this is starting to make sense to you, too," she
said to Hartley.

"Actually, it is.  And I've got to admit, I've had some meals in
the last few days I've enjoyed as much as any ever ate in the Four Sea-
sons."

"Your both crazy."

"I didn't say they were better, Laurie.  By comparison, the food
was terrible.  I said I enjoyed them as much.  There's a difference.
You'd really have to stay with Willie a while to get into the swing of
it."

"Oh, sure," she said, widened her eyes and threw up her hands,
"that's just what I need.  The ability to eat anything and enjoy it.
You're supposed to help me lose weight."

"Good point.  Want to give it another try later?"

"Maybe tomorrow.  Or maybe the next day.  I'll be filling in on the
overnight then.  Does Harris sleep?"  "For at least 20 minutes at a time."
"Lovely."  She turned her head toward Willie.  "We can send you in
then, Willie, and you can give him your lecture on enjoying dry turkey.
He sure could use it.  He threw it at me tonight."

"He t-h-r-e-w?"  Willie seemed to have trouble getting out the
word.  Hartley was certain it was the first time he'd ever seen surprise
on Willie's face.

"Well, one good thing about dry turkey is it doesn't stain."  She
shook her head.  Then she noticed Hartley's wires.  "You've got the Tens!
How is working?"

"I'm pleasantly surprised."

"Why?  Did you figure it like faith healing or crystal mumbo jumbo
or something?"

Hartley studied her face a moment, detected no sarcasm.  She knew
he was a hypnotist; he was thankful now he'd never told her he also sold
crystals.

"Well," he said, "it's just that the pain gets pretty intense, you
know, and it's hard to think this little nine-volt box can tackle it."

"That little nine-volt battery can get boosted to more like 90
volts, and if there was more current, you'd be singing with the angels."
Hartley looked down at the Tens with new respect.  And a little
discomfort.  "This thing dangerous?"

"No.  Not used like that.  Just don't put the electrodes where a
sudden sharp shock might screw up your vitals."

"Like where?"

"Like forget it and just put them where you're told."  Laurie
stretched; she had nice breasts, Hartley thought then immediately dis-
missed the thought.  He'd seen himself in the bathroom mirror that morn-
ing.  Surgery, mandatory washing by hand, dirty hair and flourescent
lights of precisely the right color to make a healthy person look sick
made him wonder how any nurse ever fell for any patient.

"Hartley!"

Willie's voice snapped Hartley to attention.

"Is seven o'clock.  Quick."

"Excuse me,"  Hartley said to Laurie as he began fiddling with the
hospital's aniquated TV remote control.  "There are priorities, and
Jeopardy is having its Teen Tournament."

"Nurse!  Oh, oh, oh God.  Nurse!"

Laurie's face clenched, her eyes closed.  Then she composed herself
and sid, "Time's up.  See you later.  You going to need your pain shot?"

"Not if this keeps working.  At least not right away."

She nodded and left.

"Good woman," Willie said then shut up.  Alex Trabek was introduc-
ing the quarter-finalists.

         The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist

  From the years 1894 to 1901 inclusive, Mr. Sherlock Holmes
was a very busy man. It is safe to say that there was no public
case of any difficulty in which he was not consulted during those
eight years, and there were hundreds of private cases, some of
them of the most intricate and extraordinary character. in which
he played a prominent part. Many startling successes and a few
unavoidable failures were the outcome of this long period of
continuous work. As I have preserved very full notes of all these
cases, and was myself personally engaged in many of them it
may be imagined that it is no easy task to know which I should
select to lay before the public. I shall, however. preserve my
former rule, and give the preference to those cases which derive
their interest not so much from the brutality of the crime as from
the ingenuity and dramatic quality of the solution. For this
reason I will now lay before the reader the facts connected with
Miss Violet Smith. the solitary cyclist of Charlington, and the
curious sequel of our investigation. which culminated in unex-
pected tragedy. It is true that the circumstance did not admit of
any striking illustration of those powers for which my friend was
famous, but there were some points about the case which made it
stand out in those long records of crime from which I gather the
material for these little narratives.
  On refering to my notebook for the year 1895, I find that it
was upon Saturday, the 23d of April, that we first heard of Miss
Violet Smilh. Her visit was, I remember, extremely unwelcome
to Holmes, for he was immersed at the moment in a very
abstruse and complicated problem concerning the peculiar perse-
cution to which John Vincent Harden, the well known tobacco
millionaire, had been subjected. My friend, who loved above all
things precision and concentration of thought, resented anything
which distracted his attention from the matter in hand. And yet
without a harshness which was foreign to his nature, it was
impossible to refuse to listen to the story of the young and
beautiful woman, tall, graceful, and queenly, who presented
herself at Baker Street late in the evening, and implored his
assistance and advice. It was vain to urge that his time was
already fully occupied, for the young lady had come with the
determination to tell her story, and it was evident that nothing
short of force could get her out of the room until she had done
so. With a resigned air and a somewhat weary smile, Holmes
begged the beautiful intruder to take a seat. and to inform us
what it was that was troubling her.
  "At least it cannot be your health," said he, as his keen eyes
darted ovel her: "so ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy."
  She glanlced down in surprise at her own feet, and I observed
the slight roughening of the side of the sole caused by the
friction of the edge of the pedal.
  "Yes, I bicycle a good deal, Mr. Holmes. and that has
something to do with my visit to you to-day."
  My friend took the lady's ungloved hand, and examined it
with as close an attention and as little sentiment as a scientist
would show to a specimen.
  "You willl cxcuse me. I am sure. It is my business," said he,
as he dropped it. "I nearly fell into the error of supposing that
you were typewriting. Of course, it is obvious that it is music.
You observe the spatulate finger-ends, Watson, which is com-
mon to both professions? There is a spirituality about the face,
however" -- she gently turned it towards thc light -- "which the
typewriter does not generate. This lady is a musician."
  "Yes, Mr. Holmes, I teach music."
  "In the country, I presume, from your complexion."
  "Yes, sir, near Farnham, on the borders of Surrey."
  "A beautiful neighbourhood, and full of the most interesting
association. You remember, Watson, that it was near there that
we took Archie Stamford, the forger. Now, Miss Violet, what
has happened to you, near Farnham, on the borders of Surrey?"
  The young lady, with great clearness and composure, made
the following curious statement:
  "My father is dead, Mr. Holmes. He was James Smith, who
conducted the orchestra at the old Imperial Theatre. My mother
and I were left without a relation in the world except one uncle
Ralph Smith, who went to Africa twenty-five years ago, and we
have never had a word from him since. When father died, we
were left very poor, but one day we were told that there was an
advertisement in the Times, inquiring for our whereabouts. You
can imagine how excited we were, for we thought that someone
had left us a fortune. We went at once to the lawyer whose name
was given in the paper. There we met two gentlemen, Mr.
Carruthers and Mr. Woodley, who were home on a visit from
South Africa. They said that my uncle was a friend of theirs
that he had died some months before in great poverty in Johan-
nesburg, and that he had asked them with his last breath to hunt
up his relations, and see that they were in no want. It seemed
strange to us that Uncle Ralph, who took no notice of us when
he was alive should be so careful to look after us when he was
dead, but Mr. Carruthers explained that the reason was that my
uncle had just heard of the death of his brother, and so felt
responsible for our fate."
  "Excuse me." said Holmes. "When was this interview?"
  "Last December -- four months ago."
  "Pray proceed."
  "Mr. Woodley seemed to me to be a most odious person. He
was for ever making eyes at me -- a coarse, puffy-faced, red-
moustached young man, with his hair plastered down on each
side of his forehead. I thought that he was perfectly hateful -- and
I was sure that Cyril would not wish me to know such a
person."
  "Oh, Cyril is his name!" said Holmes, smiling.
  The young lady blushed and laughed.
  "Yes, Mr. Holmes, Cyril Morton, an electrical engineer, and
we hope to be married at the end of the summer. Dear me, how
did I get talking about him? What I wished to say was that Mr.
Woodley was perfectly odious, but that Mr. Carruthers, who was
a much older man, was more agreeable. He was a dark, sallow,
clean-shaven, silent person, but he had polite manners and a
pleasant smile. He inquired how we were left, and on finding
that we were very poor, he suggested that I should come and
teach music to his only daughter, aged ten. I said that I did not
like to leave my mother, on which he suggested that I should go
home to her every week-end, and he offered me a hundred a
year, which was certainly splendid pay. So it ended by my
accepting, and I went down to Chiltern Grange, about six miles
from Farnham. Mr. Carruthers was a widower, but he had
engaged a lady housekeeper, a very respectable, elderly person,
called Mrs. Dixon, to look after his establishment. The child was
a dear, and everything promised weli. Mr. Carruthers was very
kind and very musical, and we had most pleasant evenings
together. Every week-end I went home to my mother in town.
  "The first flaw in my happiness was the arrival of the red-
moustached Mr. Woodley. He came for a visit of a week, and
oh! it seemed three months to me. He was a dreadful person -- a
bully to everyone else, but to me something infinitely worse. He
made odious love to me, boasted of his wealth, said that if I
married him I could have the finest diamonds in London, and
finally, when I would have nothing to do with him, he seized me
in his arms one day after dinner -- he was hideously strong -- and
swore that he would not let me go until I had kissed him. Mr.
Carruthers came in and tore him from me, on which he turned
upon his own host, knocking him down and cutting his face open.
That was the end of his visit, as you can imagine. Mr. Carruthers
apologized to me next day, and assured me that I should never
be exposed to such an insult again. I have not seen Mr. Woodley
since.                 
  "And now, Mr. Holmes, I come at last to the special thing
which has caused me to ask your advlce to-day. You must know
that every Saturday forenoon I ride on my bicycle to Farnham
Station, in order to get the 12:22 to town. The road from
Chiltern Grange is a lonely one, and at one spot it is particularly
so, for it lies for over a mile between Charlington Heath upon
one side and the woods which lie round Charlington Hall upon the
other. You could not find a more lonely tract of road anywhere,
and it is quite rare to meet so much as a cart, or a peasant, until
you reach the high road near Crooksbury Hill. Two weeks ago I
was passing this place, when I chanced to look back over my
shoulder, and about two hundred yards behind me I saw a man,
also on a bicycle. He seemed to be a middle-aged man, with a
short, dark beard. I looked back before I reached Farnham, but
the man was gone, so I thought no more about it. But you can
imagine how surprised I was, Mr. Holmes, when, on my return
on the Monday, I saw the same man on the same stretch of road.
My astonishment was increased when the incident occurred again,
exactly as before, on the following Saturday and Monday. He
always kept his distance and did not molest me in any way, but
still it certainly was very odd. I mentioned it to Mr. Carruthers,
who seemed interested in what I said, and told me that he had
ordered a horse and trap, so that in future I should not pass over
these lonely roads without some companion.
  "The horse and trap were to have come this week, but for
some reason they were not delivered, and again I had to cycle to
the station. That was this morning. You can think that I looked
out when I came to Charlington Heath, and there, sure enough,
was the man, exactly as he had been the two weeks before. He
always kept so far from me that I could not clearly see his face,
but it was certainly someone whom I did not know. He was
dressed in a dark suit with a cloth cap. The only thing about his
face that I could clearly see was his dark beard. To-day I was not
alarmed, but I was filled with curiosity, and I determined to find
out who he was and what he wanted. I slowed down my ma-
chine, but he slowed down his. Then I stopped altogether, but he
stopped also. Then I laid a trap for him. There is a sharp turning
of the road, and I pedalled very quickly round this, and then I
stopped and waited. I expected him to shoot round and pass me
before he could stop. But he never appeared. Then I went back
and looked round the corner. I could see a mile of road, but he
was not on it. To make it the more extraordinary, there was no
side road at this point down which he could have gone."
  Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. "This case certainly
presents some features of its own," said he. "How much time
elapsed between your turning the corner and your discovery that
the road was clear?"
  "Two or three minutes."
  "Then he could not have retreated down the road, and you say
that there are no side roads?"
  "None."
  "Then he certainly took a footpath on one side or the other."
  "It could not have been on the side of the heath, or I should
have seen him."
  "So, by the process of exclusion, we arrive at the fact that he
made his way toward Charlington Hall, which, as I understand
is situated in its own grounds on one side of the road. Anything
else?"
  "Nothing, Mr. Holmes, save that I was so perplexed that I felt
I should not be happy until I had seen you and had your advice."
  Holmes sat in silence for some little time.
  "Where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?" he
asked at last.
  "He is in the Midland Electrical Company, at Coventry."
  "He would not pay you a surprise visit?"
- "Oh, Mr. Holmes! As if I should not know him!"
  "Have you had any other admirers?"
  "Several before I knew Cyril."
  "And since?"
  "There was this dreadful man, Woodley, if you can call him
an admirer."
  "No one else?"
  Our fair client seemed a little confused.
  "Who was he?" asked Holmes.
  "Oh, it may be a mere fancy of mine; but it had seemed to me
sometimes that my employer, Mr. Carruthers, takes a great deal
of interest in me. We are thrown rather together. I play his
accompaniments in the evening. He has never said anything.
He is a perfect gentleman. But a girl always knows."
  "Ha!" Holmes looked grave. "What does he do for a living?"
  "He is a rich man."
  "No carriages or horses?"
  "Well, at least he is fairly well-to-do. But he goes into the
city two or three times a week. He is deeply interested in South
African gold shares."
  "You will let me know any fresh development, Miss Smith. I
am very busy just now, but I will find time to make some
inquiries into your case. In the meantime, take no step without
letting me know. Good-bye, and I trust that we shall have
nothing but good news from you."
  "It is part of the settled order of Nature that such a girl should
have followers," said Holmes, as he pulled at his meditative
pipe. "but for choice not on bicycles in lonely country roads.
Some secretive lover, beyond all doubt. But there are curious
and suggestive details about the case. Watson."
  "That he should appear only at that point?"
  "Exactly. Our first effort must be to find who are the tenants
of Charlington Hall. Then, again, how about the connection
between Carruthers and Woodley, since they appear to be men of
such a different type? How came they both to be so keen upon
looking up Ralph Smith's relations? One more point. What sort
of a menage is it which pays double the market price for a
governess but does not keep a horse, although six miles from the
station? Odd, Watson -- very odd!"
  "You will go down?"
  "No, my dear fellow, you will go down. This may be some
trifling intrigue, and I cannot break my other important research
for the sake of it. On Monday you will arrive early at Farnham;
you will conceal yourself near Charlington Heath; you will ob-
serve these facts for yourself, and act as your own judgment
advises. Then, having inquired as to the occupants of the Hall,
you will come back to me and report. And now, Watson, not
another word of the matter until we have a few solid stepping-
stones on which we may hope to get across to our solution."
  We had ascertained from the lady that she went down upon the
Monday by the train which leaves Waterloo at 9:50, so I started
early and caught the 9:13. At Farnham Station I had no diffi-
culty in being directed to Charlington Heath. It was impossible
to mistake the scene of the young lady's adventure, for the road
runs between the open heath on one side and an old yew hedge
upon the other, surrounding a park which is studded with mag-
nificent trees. There was a main gateway of lichen-studded
stone, each side pillar surmounted by mouldering heraldic em-
blems, but besides this central carriage drive I observed several
points where there were gaps in the hedge and paths leading
through them. The house was invisible from the road, but the
surroundings all spoke of gloom and decay.
  The heath was covered with golden patches of flowering
gorse, gleaming magnificently in the light of the bright spring
sunshine. Behind one of these clumps I took up my position, so
as to command both the gateway of the Hall and a long stretch of
the road upon either side. It had been deserted when I leift it, but
now I saw a cyclist riding down it from the opposite direction to
that in which I had come. He was clad in a dark suit, and I saw
that he had a black beard. On reaching the end of the Chdrlington
grounds, he sprang from his machine and led it through a gap in
the hedge, disappearing from my view.
  A quarter of an hour passed, and then a second cyclist ap-
peared. This time it was the young lady coming from the station.
I saw her look about her as she came to the Charlington hedge.
An instant later the man emerged from his hiding-place, sprang
upon his cycle, and followed her. In all the broad landscape
those were the only moving figures, the graceful girl sitting very
straight upon her machine, and the man behind her bending low
over his handle-bar with a curiously furtive suggestion in every
movement. She locked back at him and slowed her pace. He
slowed also. She stopped. He at once stopped, too, keeping two
hundred yards behind her. Her next movement was as unex-
pected as it was spirited. She suddenly whisked her wheels round
and dashed straight at him. He was as quick as she, however,
and darted off in desperate flight. Presently she came back up the
road again, her head haughtily in the air, not deigning to take
any further notice of her silent attendant. He had turned also, and
still kept his distance until the curve of the road hid them from
my sight.
  I remained in my hiding-place, and it was well that I did so,
for presently the man reappeared, cycling slowly back. He turned
in at the Hall gates, and dismounted from his machine. For some
minutes I could see him standing among the trees. His hands
were raised, and he seemed to be settling his necktie. Then he
mounted his cycle and rode away from me down the drive
towards the Hall. I ran across the heath and peered through the
trees. Far away I could catch glimpses of the old gray building
with its bristling Tudor chimneys, but the drive ran through a
dense shrubbery, and I saw no more of my man.
  However, it seemed to me that I had done a fairly good
morning's work, and I walked back in high spirits to Farnham.
The local house agent could tell me nothing about Charlington
Hall, and referred me to a well known firm in Pall Mall. There I
halted on my way home, and met with courtesy from the repre-
sentative. No, I could not have Charlington Hall for the summer.
I was just too late. It had been let about a month ago. Mr.
Williamson was the name of the tenant. He was a respectable,
elderly gentleman. The polite agent was afraid he could say no
more, as the affairs of his clients were not matters which he
could discuss.
  Mr. Sherlock Holmes listened with attention to the long report
which I was able to present to him that evening, but it did not
elicit that word of curt praise which I had hoped for and should
have valued. On the contrary. his austere face was even more
severe than usual as he commented upon the things that I had
done and the things that I had not.
  "Your hiding-place, my dear Watson, was very faulty. You
should have been behind the hedge, then you would have had a
close view of this interesting person. As it is, you were some
hundreds of yards away and can tell me even less than Miss Smith.
She thinks she does not know the man; I am convinced she does.
Why, otherwise, should he be so desperately anxious that she
should not get so near him as to see his features? You describe him
as bending over the handle-bar. Concealment again, you see. You
really have done remarkably badly. He returns to the house, and you
want to find out who he is. You come to a London house agent!"
  "What should I have done?" I cried, with some heat.
  "Gone to the nearest public-house. That is the centre of
country gossip. They would have told you every name, from the
master to the scullery-maid. Williamson? It conveys nothing to
my mind. If he is an elderly man he is not this active cyclist who
sprints away from that young lady's athletic pursuit. What have
we gained by your expedition? The knowledge that the girl's
story is true. I never doubted it. That there is a connection
between the cyclist and the Hall. I never doubted that either.
That the Hall is tenanted by Williamson. Who's the better for
that? Well, well, my dear sir, don't look so depressed. We can
do little more until next Saturday, and in the meantime I may
make one or two inquiries myself."
  Next morning, we had a note from Miss Smith, recounting
shortly and accurately the very incidents which I had seen, but
the pith of the letter lay in the postscript:

      I am sure that you will respect my confidence, Mr.
    Holmes, when I tell you that my place here has become
    difficult, owing to the fact that my employer has proposed
    marriage to me. I am convinced that his feelings are most
    deep and most honourable. At the same time, my promise is
    of course given. He took my refusal very seriously, but also
    very gently. You can understand, however, that the situa-
    tion is a little strained.

  "Our young friend seems to be getting into deep waters," said
Holmes, thoughtfully, as he finished the letter. "The case cer-
tainly presents more features of interest and more possibility of
development than I had originally thought. I should be none the
worse for a quiet, peaceful day in the country, and I am inclined
to run down this afternoon and test one or two theories which I
have formed."
  Holmes's quiet day in the country had a singular termination,
for he arrived at Baker Street late in the evening, with a cut lip
and a discoloured lump upon his forehead, besides a general air
of dissipation which would have made his own person the fitting
object of a Scotland Yard investigation. He was immensely
tickled by his own adventures and laughed heartily as he re-
counted them.
  "I get so little active exercise that it is always a treat," said
he. "You are aware that I have some proficiency in the good old
British sport of boxing. Occasionally, it is of service; today, for
example, I should have come to very ignominious grief without
it."
  I begged him to tell me what had occurred.
  "I found that country pub which I had already recommended
to your notice, and there I made my discreet inquiries. I was in
the bar, and a garrulous landlord was giving me all that I
wanted. Williamson is a white-bearded man, and he lives alone
with a small staff of servants at the Hall. There is some rumor
that he is or has been a clergyman, but one or two incidents of
his short residence at the Hall struck me as peculiarly unec-
clesiastical. I have already made some inquiries at a clerical
agency, and they tell me that there was a man of that name in
orders, whose career has been a singularly dark one. The land-
lord further informed me that there are usually weekend visitors -- 'a
warm lot, sir' -- at the Hall, and especially one gentleman with a
red moustache, Mr. Woodley by name, who was always there.
We had got as far as this, when who should walk in but the
gentleman himself, who had been drinking his beer in the tap-
room and had heard the whole conversation. Who was l? What
did I want? What did I mean by asking questions? He had a fine
flow of language, and his adjectives were very vigorous. He
ended a string of abuse by a vicious backhander, which I failed to
entirely avoid. The next few minutes were delicious. It was a
straight left against a slogging ruffian. I emerged as you see me.
Mr. Woodley went home in a cart. So ended my country trip,
and it must be confessed that, however enjoyable, my day on the
Surrey border has not been much more profitable than your
own."
  The Thursday brought us another letter from our client.

      You will not be surprised, Mr. Holmes [said she] to hear
    that I am leaving Mr. Carruthers's employment. Even the
    high pay cannot reconcile me to the discomforts of my
    situation. On Saturday I come up to town, and I do not
    intend to return. Mr. Carruthers has got a trap, and so the
    dangers of the lonely road, if there ever were any dangers,
    are now over.
      As to the special cause of my leaving, it is not merely the
    strained situation with Mr. Carruthers, but it is the reap-
    pearance of that odious man, Mr. Woodley. He was always
    hideous, but he looks more awful than ever now, for he
    appears to have had an accident, and he is much disfigured.
    I saw him out of the window, but I am glad to say I did not
    meet him. He had a long talk with Mr. Carruthers, who
    seemed much excited afterwards. Woodley must be staying
    in the neighbourhood, for he did not sleep here, and yet I
    caught a glimpse of him again this morning, slinking about
    in the shrubbery. I would sooner have a savage wild animal
    loose about the place. I loathe and fear him more than I can
    say. How can Mr. Carruthers endure such a creature for a
    moment? However, all my troubles will be over on Saturday.

  "So I trust, Watson, so I trust," said Holmes, gravely. "There
is some deep intrigue going on round that little woman, and it is
our duty to see that no one molests her upon that last journey. I
think, Watson, that we must spare time to run down together on
Saturday morning and make sure that this curious and inclusive
investigation has no untoward ending."
  I confess that I had not up to now taken a very serious view of
the case, which had seemed to me rather grotesque and bizarre
than dangerous. That a man should lie in wait for and follow a
very handsome woman is no unheard-of thing, and if he has so
little audacity that he not only dared not address her, but even
fled from her approach. he was not a very formidable assailant.
The ruffian Woodley was a very different person, but, except on
one occasion, he had not molested our client, and now he visited
the house of Carruthers without intruding upon her presence. The
man on the bicycle was doubtless a member of those week-end
parties at the Hall of which the publican had spoken, but who he
was, or what he wanted, was as obscure as ever. It was the
severity of Holmes's manner and the fact that he slipped a
revolver into his pocket before leaving our rooms which im-
pressed me with the feeling that tragedy might prove to lurk
behind this curious train of events.
  A rainy night had been followed by a glorious morning, and
the heath-covered countryside. with the glowing clumps of flow-
ering gorse, seemed all the more beautiful to eyes which were
weary of the duns and drabs and slate grays of London. Holmes
and I walked along the broad, sandy road inhaling the fresh
morning air and rejoicing in the music of the birds and the fresh
breath of the spring. From a rise of the road on the shoulder of
Crooksbury Hill, we could see the grim Hall bristling out from
amidst the ancient oaks, which, old as they were, were still
younger than the building which they surrounded. Holmes pointed
down the long tract of road which wound, a reddish yellow
band, between the brown of the heath and the budding green of
the woods. Far away, a black dot, we could see a vehicle
moving in our direction. Holmes gave an exclamation of
impatience.
  "I have given a margin of half an hour," said he. "If that is
her trap, she must be making for the earlier train. I fear, Watson,
that she will be past Charlington before we can possibly meet
her."
  From the instant that we passed the rise, we could no longer
see the vehicle, but we hastened onward at such a pace that my
sedentary life began to tell upon me, and I was compelled to fall
behind. Holmes, however, was always in training, for he had
inexhaustible stores of nervous energy upon which to draw. His
springy step never slowed until suddenly, when he was a hun-
dred yards in front of me, he halted, and I saw him throw up his
hand with a gesture of grief and despair. At the same instant an
empty dog-cart, the horse cantering, the reins trailing, appeared
round the curve of the road and rattled swiftly towards us.
  "Too late, Watson, too late!" cried Holmes, as I ran panting
to his side. "Fool that I was not to allow for that earlier train!
It's abduction, Watson -- abduction! Murder! Heaven knows whatl
Block the road! Stop the horse! That's right. Now, jump in, and
let us see if I can repair the consequences of my own blunder."
  We had sprung into the dog-cart, and Holmes, after turning
the horse, gave it a sharp cut with the whip, and we flew back
along the road. As we turned the curve, the whole stretch of road
between the Hall and the heath was opened up. I grasped Holmes's
arm.
  "That's the man!" I gasped.
  A solitary cyclist was coming towards us. His head was down
and his shoulders rounded, as he put every ounce of energy that
he possessed on to the pedals. He was flying like a racer.
Suddenly he raised his bearded face, saw us close to him, and
pulled up, springing from his machine. That coal-black beard
was in singular contrast to the pallor of his face, and his eyes
were as bright as if he had a fever. He stared at us and at the
dog-cart. Then a look oF amazement came over his face.
  "Halloa! Stop there!" he shouted, holding his bicycle to block
our road. "Where did you get that dog-cart? Pull up, man!" he
yelled, drawing a pistoll from his side pocket. "Pull up, I say
or, by George, I'll put al bullet into your horse."
  Holmes threw the reins into my lap and sprang down from the
cart.
  "You're the man we want to see. Where is Miss Violet
Smith?" he said, in his quick, clear way.
  "That's what I'm asking you. You're in her dog-cart. You
ought to know where she is."
  "We met the dog-cart on the road. There was no one in it. We
drove back to help the young lady."
  "Good Lord! Good Lord! What shall I do?" cried the stranger
in an ecstasy of despair. "They've got her, that hell-hound
Woodley and the blackguard parson. Come, man, come, if you
really are her friend. Stand by me and we'll save her, if I have to
leave my carcass in Charllington Wood."
  He ran distractedly, his pistol in his hand, towards a gap in the
hedge. Holmes followed him, and I, leaving the horse grazing
beside the road, followed Holmes.
  "This is where they came through," said he, pointing to the
marks of several feet upon the muddy path. "Halloa! Stop a
minute! Who's this in the bush?"
  It was a young fellow about seventeen, dressed like an ostler
with leather cords and gaiters. He lay upon his back, his knees
drawn up, a terrible cut upon his head. He was insensible, but
alive. A glance at his wound told me that it had not penetrated
the bone.
  "That's Peter, the groom," cried the stranger. "He drove her.
The beasts have pulled him off and clubbed him. Let him lie: we
can't do him any good, but' we may save her from the worst fate
that can befall a woman." 
  We ran frantically down the path, which wound among the
trees. We had reached the shrubbery which surrounded the house
when Holmes pulled up.
  "They didn't go to the house. Here are their marks on the
left -- here, beside the laurel bushes. Ah! I said so."
  As he spoke, a woman's shrill scream -- a scream which vi-
brated with a frenzy of horror -- burst from the thick, green
clump of bushes in front of us. It ended suddenly on its highest
note with a choke and a gurgle.
  "This way! This way! They are in the bowling-alley," cried
the stranger, darting through the bushes. "Ah, the cowardly
dogs! Follow me, gentlemen! Too late! too late! by the living
Jingo!"
  We had broken suddenly into a lovely glade of greensward
surrounded by ancient trees. On the farther side of it, under the
shadow of a mighty oak, there stood a singular group of three
people. One was a woman, our client, drooping and faint, a
handkerchief round her mouth. Opposite her stood a brutal,
heavy-faced, red-moustached young man, his gaitered legs parted
wide, one arm akimbo, the other waving a riding crop, his whole
attitude suggesive of triumphant bravado. Between them an el-
derly, gray-bearded man, wearing a short surplice over a light
tweed suit, had evidently just completed the wedding service, for
he pocketed his prayer-book as we appeared, and slapped the
sinister bridegroom upon the back in jovial congratulation.
  "They're married?" I gasped.
  "Come on!" cried our guide; "come on!" He rushed across
the glade, Holmes and I at his heels. As we approached, the lady
staggered against the trunk of the tree for support. Williamson,
the ex-clergyman, bowed to us with mock politeness, and the
bully, Woodley, advanced with a shout of brutal and exultant
laughter.
  "You can take your beard off, Bob," said he. "I know you,
right enough. Well, you and your pals have just come in time for
me to be able to introduce you to Mrs. Woodley."
  Our guide's answer was a singular one. He snatched off the
dark beard which had disguised him and threw it on the ground,
disclosing a long, sallow, clean-shaven face below it. Then he
raised his revolver and covered the young ruffian, who was
advancing upon him with his dangerous riding crop swinging in
his hand.
  "Yes," said our ally, "I am Bob Carruthers. and I'll see this
woman righted, if I have to swing for it. I told you what I'd do if
you molested her, and, by the Lord! I'll be as good as my
word."
  "You're too late. She's my wife."
  "No, she's your widow."
  His revolver cracked, and I saw the blood spurt from the front
of Woodley's waistcoat. He spun round with a scream and fell
upon his back, his hideous red face turning suddenly to a dread-
ful mottled pallor. The old man, still clad in his surplice, burst
into such a string of foul oaths as I have never heard, and pulled
out a revolver of his own, but, before he could raise it, he was
looking down the barrel of Holmes's weapon.
  "Enough of this," said my friend, coldly. "Drop that pistol!
Watson, pick it up! Hold it to his head! Thank you. You
Carruthers, give me that revolver. We'll have no more violence
Come, hand it over!"
  "Who are you, then?"
  "My name is Sherlock Holmes."
  "Good Lord!"
  "You have heard of me, I see. I will represent the official
police until their arrival. Here, you!" he shouted to a frightened
groom, who had appeared at the edge of the glade. "Come here.
Take this note as hard as you can ride to Farnham." He scrib-
bled a few words upon a leaf from his notebook. "Give it to the
superintendent at the police-station. Until he comes, I must
detain you all under my personal custody."
  The strong, masterful personality of Holmes dominated the
tragic scene, and all were equally puppets in his hands. William-
son and Carruthers found themselves carrying the wounded
Woodley into the house, and I gave my arm to the frightened
girl. The injured man was laid on his bed, and at Holmes's
request I examined him. I carried my report to where he sat in
the old tapestry-hung dining-room with his two prisoners before
him.
  "He will live," said I.
  "What!" cried Carruthers, springing out of his chair. "I'll go
upstairs and finish him first. Do you tell me that that girl, that
angel, is to be tied to Roaring Jack Woodley for life?"
  "You need not concern yourself about that," said Holmes.
"There are two very good reasons why she should, under no
circumstances, be his wife. In the first place, we are very safe in
questioning Mr. Williamson's right to solemnize a marriage."
  "I have been ordained," cried the old rascal.
  "And also unfrocked."
  "Once a clergyman, always a clergyman."
  "I think not. How about the licence?"
  "We had a licence for the marriage. I have it here in my
pocket."
  "Then you got it by a trick. But, in any case, a forced
marriage is no marriage, but it is a very serious felony, as you
will discover before you have finished. You'll have time to think
the point out during the next ten years or so, unless I am
mistaken. As to you, Carruthers, you would have done better to
keep your pistol in your pocket."
  "I begin to think so, Mr. Holmes, but when I thought of all
the precaution I had taken to shield this girl -- for I loved her,
Mr. Holmes, and it is the only time that ever I knew what love
was -- it fairly drove me mad to think that she was in the power
of the greatest brute and bully in South Africa -- a man whose
name is a holy terror from Kimberley to Johannesburg. Why,
Mr. Holmes, you'll hardly believe it, but ever since that girl has
been in my employment I never once let her go past this house
where I knew the rascals were lurking, without following her
on my bicycle, just to see that she came to no harm. I kept
my distance from her, and I wore a beard, so that she should
not recognize me, for she is a good and high-spirited girl,
and she wouldn't have stayed in my employment long if
she had thought that I was following her about the country
roads."
  "Why didn't you tell her of her danger?"
  "Because then, again, she would have left me, and I couldn't
bear to face that. Even if she couldn't love me, it was a great
deal to me just to see her dainty form about the house, and to
hear the sound of her voice."
  "Well," said I, "you call that love, Mr. Carruthers, but I
should call it selfishness."
  "Maybe the two things go together. Anyhow, I couldn't let
her go. Besides, with this crowd about, it was well that she
should have someone near to look after her. Then, when the
cable came, I knew they were bound to make a move."
  "What cable?"
  Carruthers took a telegram from his pocket.
  "That's it," said he.
  It was short and concise:

               THE OLD MAN IS DEAD.
  "Hum!" said Holmes. "I think I see how things worked, and
I can understand how this message would, as you say, bring
them to a head. But while you wait, you might tell me what you
can."
  The old reprobate with thc surplice burst into a volley of bad
language.
  "By heaven!" said he, "if you squeal on us, Bob Carruthers
I'll serve you as you served Jack Woodley. You can bleat about
the girl to your heart's content, for that's your own affair, but if
you round on your pals to this plain-clothes copper, it will be the
worst day's work that ever you did."
  "Your reverence need not be excited," said Holmes, lighting
a cigarette. "The case is clear enough against you, and all I ask
is a few details for my private curiosity. However, if there's any
difficulty in your telling me, I'll do the talking, and then you
will see how far you have a chance of holding back your secrets.
In the first place, three of you came from South Africa on this
game -- you Williamson, you Carruthers, and Woodley."
  "Lie number one," said the old man; "I never saw either of
them until two months ago, and I have never been in Africa in
my life, so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it, Mr.
Busybody Holmes!"
  "What he says is true," said Carruthers
  "Well, well, two of you came over. His reverence is our own
homemade article. You had known Ralph Smith in South Africa.
You had reason to believe he would not live long. You found out
that his niece would inherit his fortune. How's that -- eh?"
  Carruthers nodded and Williamson swore.
  "She was next of kin, no doubt, and you were aware that the
old fellow would make no will."
  "Couldn't read or write, " said Carruthers.
  "So you came over, the two of you, and hunted up the girl
The idea was that one of you was to marry her, and the other
have a share of the plunder. For some reason, Woodley was
chosen as the husband. Why was that?"
  "We played cards for her on the voyage. He won."
  "I see. You got the young lady into your service, and there
Woodley was to do the courting. She recognized the drunken
brute that he was, and would have nothing to do with him.
Meanwhile, your arrangement was rather upset by the fact that
you had yourself fallen in love with the lady. You could no
longer bear the idea of this ruffian owning her?"
  "No, by George. I couldn't!"
  "There was a quarrel between you. He left you in a rage, and
began to make his own plans independently of you."
  "It strikes me, Williamson, there isn't very much that we can
tell this gentleman," cried Carruthers, with a bitter laugh. "Yes,
we quarreled, and he knocked me down. I am level with him on
that, anyhow. Then I lost sight of him. That was when he picked
up with this outcast padre here. I found that they had set up
housekeeping together at this place on the line that she had to
pass for the station. I kept my eye on her after that, for I knew
there was some devilry in the wind. I saw them from time to
time, for I was anxious to know what they were after. Two days
ago Woodley came up to my house with this cable, which
showed that Ralph Smith was dead. He asked me if I would
stand by the bargain. I said I would not. He asked me if I would
marry the girl myself and give him a share. I said I would
willingly do so, but that she would not have me. He said, 'Let us
get her married first, and after a week or two she may see things
a bit different.' I said I would have nothing to do with violence.
So he went off cursing, like the foul-mouthed blackguard that he
was, and swearing that he would have her yet. She was leaving
me this week-end, and I had got a trap to take her to the station,
but I was so uneasy in my mind that I followed her on my
bicycle. She had got a statt, however, and before I could catch
her, the mischief was done. The first thing I knew about it was
when I saw you two gentlemen driving back in her dog-cart."
  Holmes rose and tossed the end of his cigarette into the grate.
"I have been very obtuse, Watson," said he. "When in your
report you said that you had seen the cyclist as you thought
arrange his necktie in the shrubbery, that alone should have told
me all. However, we may congratulate ourselves upon a curious
and, in some respects, a unique case. I perceive three of the
county constabulary in the drive, and I am glad to see that the
little ostler is able to keep pace with them, so it is likely that
neither he nor the interesting bridegroom will be permanently
damaged by their morning's adventures. I think, Watson, that in
your medical capacity, you might wait upon Miss Smith and tell
her that if she is sufficiently recovered, we shall be happy to
escort her to her mother's home. If she is not quite convalescent,
you will find that a hint that we were about to telegraph to a
young electrician in the Midlands would probably complete the
cure. As to you, Mr. Carruthers, I think that you have done what
you could to make amends for your share in an evil plot. There
is my card, sir, and if my evidence can be of help in your trial, it
shall be at your disposal."

  In the whirl of our incessant activity, it has often been difficult
for me, as the reader has probably observed, to round off my
narratives, and to give those final details which the curious might
expect. Each case has been the prelude to another, and the crisis
once over, the actors have passed for ever out of our busy lives.
I find, however, a short note at the end of my manuscript dealing
with this case, in which I have put it upon record that Miss
Violet Smith did indeed inherit a large fortune, and that she is
now the wife of Cyril Morton, the senior partner of Morton &
Kennedy, the famous Westminster electricians. Williamson and
Woodley were both tried for abduction and assault, the former
getting seven years and the latter ten. Of the fate of Carruthers, I
have no record, but I am sure that his assault was not viewed
very gravely by the court, since Woodley had the reputation of
being a most dangerous ruffian, and I think that a few months
were sufficient to satisfy the demands of justice.

  I fingered the laser blaster.  Something about it felt unreal.  But there was
nothing unreal about the two Garanian warriors who had rounded the slanting pile
of rubble in front of me.  Had that building once been a tram station or a
detention hall?  I couldn't remember.

  My attention returned to the two Garanians who were, I knew, looking for me.
In the cobalt blue of the Lipidus sky, they stood out like two giant brown tree
trunks--all and legs.  They moved slowly, due more to the heavy atmosphere of
Lipidus than to any fear of me.  They were easy targets, but I had to supress my
urge to blast them; a shot from my laser might catch a gas pocket, resulting in
a huge fireball.  I had seen that chain-reaction twice now and had seen it melt
both my companions.  I didn't want to see it again.

  How, then, to get rid of these two gorillas?	I tried to think back over
everything that I had learned in my two days on Lipidus.  The Garanians were
strong, much too strong for hand-to-hand combat.  Besides, I was outnumbered.  I
couldn't shoot them, for fear of a fireball.  Then it struck me!  What good was
this damn laser blaster anyway?  Not any good that I could fathom.  I turned the
weapon over in my hand, looking desperately for an over-load switch.  I knew it
had to have one -- every blaster that I had ever seen had had one.  Finally, I
found a pin on the bottom of the pistol grip.  I yanked it out and the damn
thing began to hum and vibrate.

  All right, I thought, let's hope it has at least a sixty second delay.  I set
the blaster gingerly on the sidewalk (yes, Lipidus has sidewalks), and backed
slowly away while counting to myself.  At fifteen, I decided to let the
Garanians see me.  I quickly darted out into the street and pretended to look
startled when I saw them.  One of the Garanians lifted his weapon to fire at me,
but the other knocked his hand away and growled.  I ducked back into the alley
and they gave chase on foot.

  I ran like hell, and it wasn't pretense.  Being lighter than the tree-trunk
Garanians, I wasn't afraid that they might catch me.  But I did know something
horrendous was about to happen when the laser reached melt-down.  I hoped that I
would be far enough away for it not to happen to me.

  The sides of the narrow creepy alley shined black, like the skin of a seal.
Oblong openings about three feet across lined the slippery walls.  It suddenly
dawned on me that I didn't know where I was going and, that I might end up in
worse trouble than I'd left.  At that moment, a tentacle whipped out from one of
the openings and slammed me across the face.  I went down -- hard.  The damn
thing was curling around my neck before I regained my senses.  As I ripped at it
with my gloved fingers, I thought, great, out of the frying pan and into the
fire.

  Somewhere in the recesses of my brain I remembered that the denizens of
Lipidus disliked light.  I fumbled in my holster for my flashlight (the handiest
utensil to have on Lipidus), flipped it on, and drew it out with one quick
motion.  The monster squealed at the powerful beam and recoiled instantly.  I
staggered to my feet, leaned against the wall for support, and tried to catch my
breath.

  Then it happened.  There was a soundless sound, and a huge force suddenly
sucked me off my feet.	The blast came a millisecond later, singeing my face and
beard.	I looked back down the alley just in time to see a monstrous fireball
completely engulf the two frenzied Garanians, turning them into limpid pools.  I
got to my feet, thinking that was a more dignified position from which to meet
my maker.  I paused in reflection for a moment, watching the fireball rush
towards me like a glowing freight train.  Not a bad game -- not bad at all.

  I, of course, died without any pain and found myself back in the chamber.  I
pushed open the door, and Peterson warmly grabbed my hand.

  "Great game, Mitchell!" he shouted.  "Great game!"

  "Thanks," I mumbled.  I was tired.

  "Forty-nine hours!" Peterson screamed.  "Forty-nine hours!"

  I was beginning to wish he'd shut up, or at least lower his voice.  "I've got
to sit down," I said, "and get a drink of water."

  "Real water?" Peterson smiled.

  "Please."

  Peterson fetched me a tall cool glass of H2O.  No matter how much they
improved the opticals, I mused to myself, they never got anywhere with the
savories.  Game food and drink was at best, lousy and to be avoided at all cost.
I usually didn't bother with it anymore, since training myself to go up to
seventy-two hours without food or drink.  I still got thirsty sometimes, but
never hungry; no food was preferable to that pasty protein disguised in the mind
as real grub.  My body wasn't that easily fooled.  Besides, eating and drinking
slowed down the play of the game.

  Peterson watched me eagerly.	"So what did you think?"

  "You'll get a full report," I answered between gulps.

  "Aw, can't you talk about it a little bit?" he prodded.

  I set the glass down and wiped my lips.  I knew it was not a truly great game,
because I didn't feel emotionally or physically spent, as I did with the truly
great ones.  That would be in the full report.	On the other hand, there were
some nice things I could say about "Lipidus."

  "Great opticals," I said.  This was no great surprise, as Peterson's company
was noted for its visual effects.  "The planet and inhabitants were very
realistic.  And the sensory effects were quite good too.  When that damn
tentacle hit me across the face, I thought it had broken my nose.  I'll never
figure out how you do that with just changes in air pressure."

  "The negatives," Peterson said, very seriously.  "We know what's right with
it.  What's wrong with it?"

  "To begin with," I asked, "what's the deal with the laser blaster?"

  "The laser blaster?"

  "Yeah," I replied.  "What good is it to have a laser blaster when you can't
use the damn thing?"

  "All games have laser blasters," Peterson said sheepishly.

  I nodded.  "That's just the point.  You put it in because all the others have
it, even though it not only serves no useful purpose, but is downright dangerous
to use.  It works against other features of the game.  If anyone was really
going to Lipidus, knowing about the gases there, they would never take an
incendiary weapon.  A crossbow would be better."

  Peterson looked stunned.  "A crossbow...  in a space game?"

  "Then invent a new weapon," I said.  "I'm only a test pilot.  My job is to
play 'em and spot the flaws -- I don't design them.  But that laser blaster
never felt right to me.  I think whoever designed it, knew it belonged in
another game; not this one."

  Peterson was thin-lipped.  "I designed it myself."

  "Well," I muttered, "I had fun blowing it up." I stood and stretched, ready to
call it a day -- or should I say -- two days.

  "You didn't like the game at all, did you?" Peterson asked gravely.

  "You'll get my full report," I yawned.

  Peterson's eyes narrowed behind his horn-rimmed glasses.  "I'm ruined with the
company if that game doesn't pass," he said.

  I yawned again, mumbling, "That's not my decision."

  "It can be, depending on what kind of report you turn in."

  I was getting irritated now and turned toward the engineer with a weary frown.
"Look, Peterson, if you..." It was then I noticed the needle gun in his hand.

  "Get back into the hologram chamber," he commanded.

  "What?"

  He waved the Ngun, poiting it toward the chamber.  "Get back in.  You're going
to try it again."

  I tried to summon some authority to my voice.  "You can't do this, Peterson.
Besides, playing the game again won't make me change my mind.  It's not a bad
game, and I was never going to give it a bad report."

  But the crazed software engineer wasn't listening.  "Back into the chamber,"
he hissed.

  As Peterson's gun hand was shaking rather badly, I decided not to test him.
Re-entering the holo-chamber, I already had my strategy worked out.  Peterson
couldn't stay awake as long as I could -- nobody could -- and I would simply
manage to get myself killed every now and then on the chance of finding him
napping or out of the testing room.  The worst he could do to me while I was in
the chamber was to restart the game.

  I watched him fumbling with a cartridge in the game slot, then the door
closed.

  The first few seconds in a holo-chamber were always strange.	The walls,
ceiling, and floor were a combination screen projector made up of millions of
tiny glistening refractor chips -- it was like the walls were covered with
sequins.  Then, colors began to emerge, blending and folding in with one another
like an old-fashioned kaleidoscope.  The walls melted away, the colors becoming
definite hues, and shapes to take distinct form.  I expected a laser blaster to
appear in my hand, as my spaceship hurtled out of control toward the planet
Lipidus.  Instead, I found myself in...

  A cocktail party!

  Yes, indeed.	Some very hip synthesized msuic was blaring from the floor, and
twenty or thirty cool people were milling around with drinks in their hands.  I
looked down at my own hand and saw some tall orangish concoction, with a little
pink umbrella sticking out the top of it.  I also seemed to be dressed better
than usual, in a blazer of some purplish color.  While still taking in the
surrounds, a beautiful -- almost impossibly beautiful -- blond strode up to me
and stopped two inches from my chest.  At least her most forward aspects stopped
there -- the rest of her stopped some distance back.

  "Hello," she said.

  All right, I said to myself, I'm in some kind of erotic adventure.  I didn't
know if Peterson had gotten the cartridges switched, or even if he was aware of
it, but I knew my plan was out the window.  It's very difficult to get yourself
killed in an erotic adventure.	Practically anything, though, was possible.

  "You're shy," smiled the beautiful blond.  Of course, she had been programmed
to say that to anyone who didn't talk very much.

  I ignored her and just kept on thinking.  My experience in these kinds of
games was limited; I usually found myself avoiding monsters and peculiar aliens.
I didn't know who tested erotic adventures, but it certainly wasn't me.  I
suspected it was the president of the company.

  I studied the girl.  She must have been given a fairly complex artificial
intelligence, I decided, in order to hold a conversation with a complete
stranger.  Maybe if I asked the right questions, she could help me get out of
this jam.

  "What's your name?" she cooed.

  "Mitchell," I said.  "What's yours?"

  "Alice."

  Funny, she didn't look like an Alice.  More like an Inga.

  "How do I exit this game?" I asked her.

  "Exit?" she smiled.  "But you only just got here." She batted her eyelashes
and gently touched my chest.

  "But it's important I leave now," I answered back.  "I have a phone call to
make, then I'll come right back."

  "It can wait, I'm sure," purred Alice.  She suddenly grabbed my free hand and
began swaying to the music.  "Let's dance!"

  "No!" I shouted.  I grabbed the vacuous blond and shook her violently.  "I
want to get out of here, understand?"

  A look of understanding did come into Alice's eyes.  "Maybe you'd like to meet
my roommate, Marsha.  Or my other roommate, Trisha.  She's an airline
stewardess."

  I swore under my breath.

  "If that doesn't suit you," Alice continued, "there's my hairdresser friend,
Felipe."

  "Excuse me," I said, walking away.

  I got about eight steps before a sultry brunette grabbed my arm.  "Got a
light?" she asked, waving what looked like a hand-rolled cigarette or a joint in
my face.

  I started to say no, then I realized that my purple jacket probably came
equipped with a few choice utensils.  I reached in and drew out several objects:
one was a set of keys to God-only-knows-what, another was a small vial of white
powder, and a third was a gold-plated lighter.	I lit her cigarette.

  "You don't like it here, do you?" she asked.

  I declined her offer of the pot.  "No.  I'm looking for a way to get out."

  "My apartment is only a few blocks from here.  My car is right out front." So
is mine probably, I thought to myself.	"Who knows how to exit from the game?" I
asked.

  She pointed toward a large man with a completely bald head.  "That's Hubert.
This is his place and his party.  He knows everything."

  I strode over to Hubert.  "Hello, Hubert," I said.

  "Hello, Mitchell," he replied.  "Glad to see you could make it."

  At first I was stunned he knew my name, then I realized that I had told it to
the blond.  By now, everybody in the place knew my name.

  "How do you exit the game?" I asked.

  "Don't you like it here?" Hubert asked smugly.  "Everybody finds my parties
so...  interesting."

  "Interesting is not what I'm looking for right now," I answered.  "I'm tired,
and I want to go home."

  "Go home then.  You live just down the street."

  "Home, Hubert.  My real home.  How do I exit the game?"

  Somebody passed Hubert a joint, and he took a big hit.  "You automatically
have that option after an encounter."

  "I want to go now," I repeated, emphasizing the "now."

  "Out of the question," Hubert replied with a toss of his head.  He gave me a
very fruity grin.

  I hadn't been playing action-adventure games as a living for six years for
nothing.  I merely picked up a bar stool and smashed it across Hubert's idiotic
face.

  Hubert lay on the floor in a pool of real-looking blood.  It suddenly dawned
on me that a little sado-masochism might be written into this game, and I wasn't
wrong.	Two musclemen-types quickly came at me.  One I dispatched with a whisky
bottle, but the other one landed a left hook to the side of my face.  My ears
buzzing, I rammed him in the gut with my head, then dropped him with a knee well
below the belt.  Gee, this game was sort of fun.

  There were no other takers.  In fact, everyone froze as a voice came from the
stereo, saying, "If you wish to continue the game, please be seated.  If not,
please remain where you presently are."

  I remained standing.	Apparently, beating somebody to a pulp, in this game,
was the same as an erotic encounter.

  Within a few seconds, the walls around me began to dissolve, and the
curvacious blonds and brunettes became, once more, mere refracted light beams.
Gingerly, I pushed open the door of the chamber and stepped out.

  Peterson's back was towards me, and he was immersed in watching figures dance
across a computer video screen.  Apparently, in his madness, he thought I really
would play his silly game all over again.  And just as certainly, he must not
have known about the switch of the cartridges.

  The gun lay beside him, on top of an oscilliscope.

  In two bounds, I was across the room and had the pipsqueak programmer by the
throat.  He scrambled for the gun, but I was able to drag him out of his chair
and half-way across the floor.	It was then that Peterson surprised me with a
swift bony elbow to my ribs.  I doubled over and just managed to catch him by
the scuff of the neck, as he hurried back toward the gun.  They say that madmen
have the strength of ten, and I was beginning to believe it.  Peterson and I
thrashed about on the floor for awhile until I realized that he was more than I
could handle.  While still able I maneuvered him to the door of the hologram
chamber, kicked it open, and hurled both of us inside.

  I pinned him to the floor as the door slowly shut.  Closing the door activated
the game, and the door would remain shut and locked until the game was over.
This wasn't for the player's sake, but to avoid damaging the circuits.

  Peterson jumped to his feet and threw himself against the door, howling like
one of his Garanians.

  "Calm down," I said.  "You know you can't get the door opened.  Sit back and
enjoy the game."

The following appeared in the Feb. 12 issue of Albany, NY's
METROLAND magazine.  I offer it in the spirit of the February holiday
that attracts the most attention.
				   --B. A. N. (73170,2713)
			       *
			V-DAY BLUES
			by B. A. Nilsson
			       *
	"I've had enough of her. Can you put up with the kid for a
couple of days?" It was my brother-in-law Ted the Yuppie, trying to
fob his uncommunicative kid, Melanie, off on me. "Valentine's Day is
approaching and she's real depressed over some guy."
	He dropped her off at my house and she marched sullenly up the
walk, entered, said nothing, and dropped into a chair at the kitchen
table. She grunted in response to my greeting. "Take off your coat,"
I suggested. She didn't.
	She's an attractive kid, for 15. Actually, I find it hard to
judge adolescent beauty any more. The farther I race away from that
age, the more they look like ungainly foals.
	"So who's this guy you're worried about?" I boldly asked.
	"Terry," she said with a wry laugh. "He's such a gronk!"
	"He's ignoring you or something?"
	"He doesn't know what he's doing. I mean, he likes me and all,
but he's too busy being one of the guys to do anything about it,
like he's afraid they'll laugh at him cause some of his friends
don't think I'm good enough or something."
	As Melanie warmed to the subject she slipped off her coat,
brushed her hair from her eyes and drummed her fingers on the table.
	"Have you been going out with him long?"
	She narrowed her eyes at me. "We haven't gone out at all. He's
too scared to ask me. I'll probably have to do it myself."
	"Sometimes you have to," I said. "It took me a while to
understand that asking for a date isn't life-threatening. But some
guys need a push. Me, for instance."
	"You? Really?" She studied her old uncle for a moment. "Someone
asked you out?"
	"I learned a valuable lesson. Flowers and candy and such are
powerful dating tools."
	"Oh, that's old-movie stuff," she said scornfully. "Nobody does
that anymore."
	"You should try it. My lesson came when I was about your age.
It was my first date, as a matter of fact. On Valentine's Day."
			     *
	I was kind of a lonely kid (I began), without any of the
popular splinter groups to belong to. There were the Jocks, the
Freaks and the Brains, but I was run-of-the-mill.
	A girl named Kate Norcross caught my eye, mainly because her
locker was next to mine and I saw her there every morning and often
between classes. But I was too scared to do anything about it.
	You know how that gets. You think about the person, you think
about her obsessively, next thing you know she blots out everything
else in your life.
	And you try not to show it.
	I was into my old-movies phase at the time, drawing all of my
life's lessons from the wisdom of Hollywood. I tried to give myself
some Hollywood confidence, all the while asking what James Cagney
would do.
	So I'm cool as ice cream, taking off my coat one winter day,
when Kate leans over and asks to borrow a pencil.
	I give it to her with a trembling hand. I know in that hard-to-
reach sensible part of my soul that she doesn't really need a
pencil, but I play along. She hands it back with thanks. Now we're
friends.
	Now I'm desperate to talk to her again, and can think of
nothing to say. Nothing worth saying, that is. I already had
exhausted the subject of the pencil, telling her every detail of
where I got it and why it's a little chewed and nevertheless she
could have it if she wanted it and so on.
	And I'm dying to ask about, oh, what she likes to read, to eat,
to watch on TV, but feel so selfconscious that I can do nothing but
gape.
	"You're awfully quiet," she finally said a few days later.
	"Yeah," I agreed. "I can never think of things to say."
	"I like that," she said. "I'm tired of people who talk too
much."
	"Yeah," I agreed. "Me too."
	"So," she said. "You want to go out to a movie or something?"
	You better believe it. The ice had been broken, the street was
clear--and it was my opportunity to embark upon the date of dates
I'd been dreaming of since puberty.
	Predictable how uncooperative the world gets when you've got a
great idea. A trip to the fusty little movie house in our
Connecticut town was not for me--we were near enough to Manhattan to
warrant an elegant voyage to the city and one of the palatial uptown
theaters for a first-run film.
	Having had my license for the better part of a month, I
considered myself a journeyman driver. But I knew my parents would
never cotton to the notion of letting me take one of their cars, so
I didn't ask. I didn't even tell them about the date. I borrowed a
car from an older friend, a motoring enthusiast named Steve who kept
a small fleet, and on Valentine's Day, a Saturday, we left for the
ninety-minute drive to Manhattan.
	I felt like a king in my friend's big old Imperial, a vintage
monster with suicide doors and six-way adjustable seats. True, it
lacked some of the necessary muffler connections, and he warned me
to top off the brake fluid every few hundred miles--but I felt like
a king in this mighty machine.
	My first inkling of trouble came when the Merritt Parkway
turned into the Hutch, the Hutchinson River Parkway, that is.
Connecticut's graceful antique highway became a Westchester County
racetrack, narrowing into a thin, twisty band, a colorful but
venomous snake.
	"Are you sure you know what you're doing?" Kate asks mildly. I
notice that her knuckles have a day-glo sheen.
	"I forgot how crazy this road is," I answered, swerving to
avoid a Cutlass that's just plain stopped in the left lane.
	"Have you ever driven it before?" she asked.
	I don't think she should have started yelling just because I
admitted the truth. And I know I shouldn't have gotten off the Hutch
in the middle of Yonkers just because she insisted she'd hate me
forever if I didn't.
	We made it by back streets from Yonkers into the Bronx. We took
the Triborough Bridge into Queens. Then we got onto the BQE, the
Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. And landed somewhere in Brooklyn.
	I can think of no more hateful phrase than "Why don't you ask
somebody?" If I'm a little confused while driving I like to work it
out myself. But I was prepared to ask someone, anyone, how to get
the hell out of Brooklyn, if I only could have found someone to ask.
	Kate stared out her window, I kept a watch out mine. Was
Valentine's Day a national holiday here?
	Pretty soon we were cruising through a neighborhood of charred,
gutted buildings and it was getting dusky. Away in the distance we
saw the lights of cars on an elevated highway and we drove for it,
ignoring one-way street signs and other dumb impediments.
	We ended up at Kennedy Airport. "Want to stretch your legs?" I
asked.
	"I think I want to go home," she said.
	You have to remember that the inside of an Imperial is like a
small apartment. When she slid to hug the passenger door, it was as
if she were on the other side of a classroom.
	The ride back was very quiet.
	I stopped at a Pathmark en route because I had a last-chance
idea to save this evening. It was just before nine, and I slipped
into the next-door liquor store and wasn't even proofed.
	Kate was playing with the radio when I got back. She said
nothing. We drove on.
	The final indignity was a sudden snow squall. Temperatures had
been hovering around freezing all day; now the skies let loose with
all sorts of precipitation. I was off the Merritt, driving one of
the Connecticut potholes they call a state route, when I went into a
skid, hit the nonexistent brakes, and shimmered the car neatly off
the road, sideways, into a pile of snowy mud.
	Kate buried her face in her hands.
	I did a little wheel spinning, but we knew it was useless. "I'm
going to have to call a tow truck," I said. "Want to come?"
	"I'm not waiting here!"
	We trekked along Route 123 looking for a phone. Kate had her
hands jammed in her pockets and was shivering. Great opportunity for
a comforting arm around the back, I thought. Lousy opportunity, I
discovered.
	"This isn't my idea of a great date," she said.
	How would Fred Astaire deal with this? I wondered. He'd
probably sing, but he always had an orchestra standing by. Still, I
tried for an Astaire-like nonchalance. "It's not that bad," I
ventured. "Whoever thought we'd see Brooklyn on our first date? We
learned how not to drive to the city. We saw some planes take off
and land. We've seen a lot of highways."
	She didn't respond.
	"If I were Fred Astaire I'd sing to you now."
	"You're nuts."
	We found a phone and I called Steve, who promised to dispatch a
tow truck on his triple-A card. He brushed aside my apologies but
warned me that on a night like this the trucks would be in high
demand.
	"Better get comfortable," he said with a wink in his voice.
	There are missed opportunities you will always regret. Why
didn't I speak to the lady who smiled at me on the bus? Why didn't I
just tell the boss to go to hell?
	So it's very important to keep the opportunities you didn't
miss in memory, and that's why I'm so partial to the recollection of
that wait for the tow truck.
	In Pathmark I bought some cheese and crackers and a box of
Whitman's candy. And I had a bottle of champagne.
	We let the car run so we'd have some heat and broke open the
feast. The seat titled far enough back to give us plenty of room,
and we ate with our fingers and drank from the bottle.
	"This isn't so bad," Kate finally decided.
	Best for last. I had bought her a supermarket bouquet, nothing
special, but flowers nevertheless.
	"For V-Day," I said.
	"Why, how sweet!" she cried, and kissed me, setting a precedent
we spent the rest of our wait investigating. Indeed, she was
snuggled against my arm when the lights of the tow truck brightened
our fogged-up windows.
			    *
	"Our parents were all pretty pissed off," I concluded, seeing
that Melanie's attention had wandered, "but we didn't care. Still,
the romance didn't really go anywhere. Turned out she had a
boyfriend in college and she was just testing the waters before
throwing in with him for the long haul."
	"I gotta use your phone," Melanie said abruptly, hurtling from
the table.
	She punched a number from memory. "Is Terry there?" she asked,
then listened. "Know where he is?" Pause. "Oh. Thanks. Bye."
	Back to the table. "He's looking for me. Huh."
	"Well, that's good news," I offered. "He'll probably be here
with flowers and candy any minute."
	"Gross."
	Terry arrived, all right. He wore a ratty herringbone overcoat
with the collar turned up. His hair was short at the sides and swept
into a coxcomb at the top. "Whatcha doing?" he asked.
	Melanie shrugged.
	"Grab a pizza?"
	"Sure."
	He dropped an arm over her shoulders and steered her out.
	"Don't you want your coat?" I called after her.
	"You wear it, Romeo," she answered.
	I felt like a sit-com dad. What would Bill Cosby do?

                          JACKMAC'S DISCOVERY

                           by Jeff Epstein

        The orange radar basketball gracefully sailed through the air,
changed trajectory slightly, and came down through the hoop, as Duke
Williams had hoped for. "Awwwww-RIGHT!" he yelped with pleasure.
     
        Grabbing the rebound, Bill Taylor eluded Steve and Tommy's flanking
maneuvers and headed up court. Duke threw up his hands and Bill passed him
the ball. Steve and Tommy were effective guards, however, being taller. The
ball seemed almost indecisive in mid-air, shifting left, then right, as the
teenage boys waved their hands at it, fighting for control. Bill was
considering a pass back to Duke when he spotted something out of the corner
of his eye that made him do a double-take. He stopped and pointed.
      
        "Hey, look, you guys, Jackmac's back!"
     
        Instantly the game came to a sudden halt, and the ball fell to the
ground. Sure enough, Jack MacNamara was slowly walking onto the sunlit
asphalt of the court.
      
        "Hey, Jackmac!"
     
        Jackmac grinned back at his staring buddies. Fresh out of the
hospital, he had been anticipating this moment for days. He was still weak
and pale, his body a tall, thin frame. "Well, hello there," he called to
them.
      
        The four boys rushed over. Jackmac was 16, the same age as Duke, and
a year older than Bill and Steve. Tommy, at 14, was the youngest. They had
all been friends for years.
     
        Duke looked at Jackmac with puzzlement. "Whaddya doing out now,
Jack? Thought you were in for a month?"
      
        Jack looked down at his sneakers briefly, a curl of brown hair
falling over his forehead. "It turned out to be cool. Somehow my folks got
the money for the medicine I needed, and that did the trick. Doc said I'm
fine now. So they let me come home."
      
        "Neat," said Tommy. "Can you play?"
      
        "What, now?" Jack laughed. Oh, he wanted to. But he knew his parents
wouldn't like it, and they had the most uncanny way of finding out what he
was up to. Besides, Mom and Dad seemed to have finally stopped fighting
during his periodic illnesses. He sighed. "Naw, gimme a break. I had to
fight my parents just to let me come over here. Maybe in a few days."
      
        "You wuss. You don't look so bad. Shoot a shot," Bill challenged.
      
        Jack tried to demur again, but the four boys quickly set up a chorus
of "Shoot a shot!" until he could no longer resist. He swept his hand across
the basketball on the ground and quickly got it airborne. The games just
hadn't been the same without Jackmac. He was the absolute master at radar
basketball, almost like a ballet artist-cum-juggler as he gently coaxed the
ball through the air with his outstretched fingers inches away. He did his
trick. Jackmac made a circular motion with his index finger, and the ball
responded in kind. Then, with a hard but precise snap of his hand, he sent
he ball flying across the court toward the hoop. It hit the backboard and
bounced down.
      
        He shrugged as the others laughed. "Hey, I'm out of practice."
      
        "C'mon, let's go do something," Steve said.
      
        "Like what?" said Bill.
      
        "I dunno. I gotta go get a book from the library for the history
project."   
      
        "You didn't pick a president yet?" said Duke. Steve always got
behind on projects. "I picked Boxer."
      
        "Boxer!" Bill sneered. "She was only elected in 2012. I thought we
had to do 20th Century presidents. Like, I picked Ronald Reagan."
      
        Thus the group, including a nervous but mischievous Jackmac, decided
to skill-skate over to the library. Selecting Steve's 20th Century president
soon became a group exercise in mutual boredom. They prowled the stacks of
biographies.      
      
        "You could do Washington," Tommy suggested between attempts at
bubble-gum blowing.
      
        Steve rolled his eyes skyward. "Yeah, right. Everybody does
Washington."      
      
        "The thing is, you know, Mr. Revela likes it better if you go way
back.  I had to do this last year," said Duke.
      
        "So, who'd you do?" Steve asked.
      
        "Jimmy Carter."
      
        "Oh, yeah, the peanut guy,"  Bill recognized. "Why'd he'd only serve
one term?"
      
        "Reagan wiped him out!" said Jackmac.
      
        "It wasn't just Reagan," Duke corrected. "He had a tough primary
challenge from Senator Edward Kennedy."   
      
        Steve looked slightly confused. "Kennedy. There was a president
named Kennedy. The one who got shot. Was that him?"
      
        "No. That Kennedy came before. This guy was the brother who didn't
get shot. I almost did John F. Kennedy," said Duke. "But there's too many
books on him. Dozens."
      
        The five boys walked over the section where the Kennedy books were,
and pulled down some the many historical volumes.
      
         "This is gross," said Tommy. "All this stuff is about the
conspiracy and how he got shot. Bang! Bang!"
      
        Duke pulled down a heavy, thick book. "Here's a biography of the
Kennedy family. You know, Steve, if you tackled this and aced it, you'd be
in with Revela like greased lighting."
      
        Steve flipped through the pages, looking at the pictures of the old
Kennedy clan gathered around the compound at Hyannisport, Massachusetts. He
stopped on one page at looked hard at Jackmac. He looked at the page again.   
      
        "Hey, Jackmac, check this out. This guy looks just like you!"
      
        Jackmac studied the photo of the young John F. Kennedy. His eyebrows
shot up in surprise. "Wow!"   
      
        The others, curiosity piqued, looked over Jackmac's shoulder at the
old black-and-white photo. The hair was a little different, but the face was
a dead-ringer for Jackmac himself.
      
        "Look at that, Jackmac, that's you! And his name was Jack, too!"
giggled Tommy.
      
        "It really does look like you," agreed Duke.
      
        "Yeah," Jackmac smiled slowly, "I can see some resemblance. But what
do I care if I look like some old dead president!"
      
        They all laughed.
      
        "Hey, Jackmac, take that home and show your Mom. She'll love it."
      
        "Yeah, I will," Jackmac smiled. "In fact, I'd better get back home
now or she'll pop a cork!"
      
        Jackmac and the others stood in line for the checkout card reader.
He noticed an old man with white hair staring at him. He thought for a
second he had seen him at the hospital. But when he looked at the man, he
turned away.
      
        "Who's that old guy?" said Bill.
      
        "I dunno. Just some weirdo, I guess."
      
        The group trotted down the library steps into the sunshine, where
Jackmac parted company from the others.   
      
        "Nice to have you back, Jack," said Tommy. "Hey, I'm a poet and
don't know it!"

        "Hey, buzz me tomorrow, man, we'll hang out," Bill offered.
      
        "Yeah, okay. See you later," Jackmac grinned. He watched as the four
boys hopped on their skill-skates and zipped away, waving. It was just like
old times. He felt almost completely back to normal. It felt so good to just
be standing there with nobody around, no doctors or parents fussing over
him.  Jackmac knew that sooner or later he was going to have to take a stand
for himself. He had no use, for example, for the social studies courses Mom
and Dad insisted he take. Next year he was going to take an elective in
zero-gravity botany, whether they liked it or not.
      
        Just then, Jackmac's communicator warbled. "Jack, where are you?"
Mother, of course. He stifled a moan. "Oh, Mom, I was out with the guys.
I'm on my way home now."
      
        "Do you feel all right, Jack?"
      
        "I'm fine, mother. I'll see you in a few minutes!" He clicked the
communicator off with annoyance.    
      
        Ten minutes later, Jackmac banged open the screen door to the
kitchen.  His mother, an attractive but disheveled woman in her mid-forties,
was at the table worrying over bills, as usual. She looked up.
      
        "Hi, honey. Did you have a good time with your friends?"
      
        "Yeah," he said flatly. He started for the stairs, not even slowing
down. 
      
        "What's that book?"
      
        He remembered, and abruptly came to a halt.
      
        "Oh, yeah. This was just something funny I wanted to show you. We
were at the library. You know that guy John F. Kennedy, the president who
got shot in the car in the 1960s?"  He flipped open the book.
      
        "What about him, Jack?" There was a strange edge in her voice.
      
        "This is what he looked like at about my age." He showed her the
photo.
      
        Jackmac watched as his mother slowly rose and took the book out of
his hands. The smile he expected never materialized. She just stood there,
with her face wrinkling into...what? It looked almost like fear.
      
        The silence continued. Jackmac didn't know what to do. Finally, he
couldn't bear the awkwardness any more.   
      
        "What's the matter, Mom? Don't you see the resemblance?"
      
        "Oh...yes, honey. He looks a little like you, I guess." She handed
the book back distractedly. Her eyes were far away. "Jack, wash up for
dinner now.  Your father will be back soon."
      
        Jack was confused, but knew better than to say anything. That would
just make her mad. He slowly went up the steps to his room.
      
        Mom and Dad must have had another fight, he decided. That was par
for the course. Sooner or later, he realized, they would probably get
divorced.  Spinning on an imaginary court, he whirled and twirled and
flopped onto the bed. Damn. The fights always seemed to be about money.
Getting medicine for him had seemed impossible...then all of a sudden it
wasn't. What happened, anyway? His reverie was interrupted by the sound
of his father downstairs.  Then he heard his mother sobbing, and his
father's muffled yelling.
      
        Here we go again!* he thought.
     
        A half-hour later, the noises stopped and he heard footsteps
plodding up the stairs. Oh, no, was he involved in this? Two quick knocks,
and his tearyeyed mother opened the door. "Jack...your father and I need
to talk with you."His father followed right behind, a big man with a furious
scowl in front of his graying temples.
      
        "What did I do, Mom!"  He was on full alert now. He didn't even know
what it was about this time. He jumped up."Mom, I didn't do anything! We 
just went to the library! I swear!"      
      
        "I believe you honey. You're not in trouble."
      
        "Sit down, Jack!" his father snapped. That didn't sound like he
wasn't in trouble. His parents sat on the edge of the bed, heads bowed.
Jack slowly sat in the wicker chair opposite them and waited tensely. More
silence. They didn't seem to know how to begin.
      
        Finally, his father looked at him. "Jack, do you remember when you
were in science class, how you cloned those frog tadpoles?"
      
        "Yeah," he answered cautiously. "It was boring. We made frogs out of
frogs."     
      
        "Do you remember what you learned about cloning, son?"
      
        What in the world was this all about?* His parents surely didn't
come up here to talk about science, did they? But he had to answer the
question, blindly.
      
        "Well, small mammals can be cloned, like certain whales, and rats, I
guess. Why?"      
      
        His mother spoke, more composed now, but her eyes still red.
"Jack...they can clone people, too."
      
        "People! Mom, you're being ridiculous! You even told me that last
year.  What are you talking about?"
      
        His father held up a hand to stop him. "Son, I know that's what all
the books say. That cloning humans is far into the future. But there was a
secret experiment nobody knows about, except us."
      
        Jack was pop-eyed. He waited for more.
      
        "Jack...the first human to be cloned...they had to have a baseline,
son.  It was a government-funded project...it-- it had to be somebody whose
lifetime was known, somebody they could study. And ideally someone who had
died prematurely, so they could see the genetic development, and-- and the
impact of the environment."
      
        His father paused to give Jack a chance to absorb the information.
But he was just blank. He couldn't understand what his father was telling
him.
      
        "Son, when your mother told me you found that book about Kennedy, I
knew the day we dreaded had arrived. Jack...you don't just look like him.
You ARE him. You are an exact cloned duplicate of John F. Kennedy. Every
single cell."
      
        "No! You're crazy, Dad! Mom! Have you both gone nuts! What's going
on here!" His mother began to cry again.
      
        "It's true," she sobbed. "We-we didn't want to tell you, but we
knew you would find out, someday."
      
        "I don't believe you! I'm not John F. Kennedy, I'm John Edward
MacNamara!" 
      
        His parents just stared at him. He stood looking back, in shock.
     
        And finally, his parents blurred into a veil of tears. They hugged
him, crying, knowing it would never be the same again, that the illusion
they wished to continue forever was, inevitably, over. The 16-year-old they
had raised from a baby would never be the same again. Jackmac knew it too.
Only he hadn't expected it to happen like this.

Okay, guys.  We're starting over.  Be mature about it, don't digress
or get hostile, and just write.  Okay?	Thanks...


   The summer night slowly crept on.  A group of teenagers had decided to get
away from the heat and go camping in New Jersey.  They had one van and 10 sleep
-ing bags, so they had no problems.  For two weeks they were free from parents
and were just pleased to get away.  On the last night, everybody felt a little
sad that this was it, but the kids were firm that this would be the best night
yet.  A tall red haired girl named
Rommye had planned a sing-a-long for that night, and everyone was looking
forward to it.	Two of the boys started collecting firewood at dusk.  Withing
an hour they had a roaring fire blazing
and were in the midst of the loudest noise the forest had heard in quite a while

  Fifty miles away, a twenty megaton bomb exploded about William Penn's hat.
The temperature rose to 150,000,000 in one millionth of a second.  3,000,000
people in Philadelphia and the area were killed instantly.  Everything for
40 miles around ground zero burst into
raging flames.
   Fifty miles to the west, the aging vinyard master saw the looming
mushroom cloud.  "Damn!", he muttered, "There go my best customers."
   He slowly gathered his tools, ambled over to the shed and - as he had
done many times in his many years - put them away carefully.  Each one
had its place in a system only he knew.
   His daughter (now dead) in Philadelphia used to kid him about the seeming
disorder in the shed.  He remembered her chiding him about the randomness
in his organization almost everytime the family - her and his grandchildren -
visited.  The memory and the realization that he had been nagged, lovingly,
for the last time brought a sudden tear that ran down one of the many
crags and crevasses in his sun-worn face.
   "Well, he said to himself, "she said she'd hafta clean it up someday
and I said she had better wait till I was dead.  Too late now ... "
   He carefully locked-up the shed, went into the house, got his pistol,
and shot himself.  Nobody noticed.

  MEANWHILE THE KIDS BACK AT CAMP SAW THE EXPLOSION GLOWING IN THE DISTANCE.
THE TALL RED HAIRED IMMEDIATELY NEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND TOOK CONTROL OF THE
SITUATION.  SHE ORDERED ALL OF THE KIDS INTO A NEARBY CAVE WHERE THEY ALL
SQUEEZED INTO A CREVICE TO AVOID THE COMING FALLOUT.  HOW WAS SHE TO KNOW THAT
THEY MIGHT JUST AS WELL HAVE CHOSEEN TO DIE?  HOW WAS SHE TO KNOW WHAT WAS TO
COME?  HER NAME WAS WENDI.

Wendi had enough smarts to know that no matter what she did they were all goners
At that range and distance it would be only a matter of moments before the tre-
mendous heat of the blast reached them, then the blast would come, and lastly
the radiation that would cook their bodies from the inside out. She wondered to
herself 'Who would have thought a camping trip would be A-bombed?'

   Large billows of sulfurous smoke billowed before Wendi.  Then a small
horned creature emerged from tDwithin the stench, coughing.
   "By lord Lucifer's gonads, we've GOT to get the transportation system fixed!"
he muttered.   Squinting in Wendi's direction, he said "Hey, kid, are you the
leader of this unfortunate bunch?"
   "Ye-e-es", she stammered.
   "Well the boss has an offer you can't refuseh
We call it the 'pay me now & pay me later' option plan.  Here it is ...".  The
demon produced a long roll of parchement.
   "Oh you devil, you!" she responded, grabbing the document and scanning it.
"The usual Faust contract?"
   "Oh, not at all!  This is our special instant resurrection plan for
nuclear accidents"
   Intrigued, Wendi unrolled the parchement and began to read ...

  Suddenly she burst out "What do you mean, '80% of my soul'?????"

   "Well, it's really self explanatory.  Just sign on the blazing line."

   "Sorry, I'd rather live through this nightmare. "  she threw the parchment
and walked back into the cave.

   The demon sighed and dissapeared.  Another one of those days.

   Around the world 3500 nuclear warheads exploded.  3,700,000,000 were killed.
Untold havok became the rule, and order the exception.
The entire world blazed with nuclear fire, the once great cities were now all
vaporized into radioactive dust, and the bones of the people who once lived
there were were scattered as the winds began to churn.
   Meanwhile back in the cave, Dan found a flashlight, and explored the back of
the cave where he found an entrance to an inner chamber. "Hey! C'mon back guys,
there's more to this cave!" The rest ran towards Dan, and followed him deeper
into the cavern. Rats, and bats scurried past them, and the girls all squealed
as they felt the rats run past their legs, and bats flying past their heads.
   As they ventured deeper into the cave, the stark realization of the world
ending hit them.

   Wendy decided to change her name again, but the old one, "Rommye",
looked misspelled as it was so she decided on "Suzi", after the heroine in
one of her favourite films. "It's all Reagan's fault," she muttered as they
explored the musty reaches of the cavern.
   Marty, one of the younger of the kids, caught her voice as she said it and
asked "Why is it all Reagan's fault?"
   "I don't know," she replied; "it just seemed like the thingto say."
   "Boy, it's lucky we brought this lantern with us," Carl announced. "It's a
newone, so the battery will last a while. Let's take inventory." They produced
a sack of food, a canteen full of water, and someone had a few old keys from
home that they had somehow grabbed when the bomb hit Philly. Naturally, no one
had remembered the cheese dip, and the only digital watch among them had quit
keeping the correct time earlier that night in a fit of pique.
   "Hey, add this to the inventory!" Marty yelled, apologizing an instant later
for showering them all with ceiling debris.
   Carl took the black rod from him and examined it, wondering what the star
on the tip was for... it looked for all the world like a Fairy Godmother's magic
than stringent quality control.
   As he handed the lantern to Suzi so that he could get a closer and more
careful look at the thing, the teenaged girl cried out, for she had seen a
message inscribed on the wall in an uneven script. Taking the light off Carl's
wand, she focussed it on the rock and the group saw
	MAGIC WORD: XYZZY
   From deeper in the tunnel-like cavern the song of a small bird incongruously
emerged.


The bird's song grew louder and a flapping of wings was heard....there! out
of the darrk flew a battered sparrow. It  perched on a near by rock and
stared at the young campers. An eeire starre - as if to say "you are in
danger here ...you do not belong to this life" .

From the mouth of the cave a yellowish glow came and heat. The blast not many
miles away had finally reached them. They knew now that they were alone in the
orld......alone except for the starnge beings in the cave with them.

Suzi shined the flashlight at the small bird. It sat there arrogant..looking
back into the beam..it's eyes looking evil and penetrating. With a screach and
wildly flapping wings it returned to the darkest reaches of the cave.

Suzi and Carl looked at each other - speechless. Then both turned and looked
again at the scrpit on the wall.....it seemed as if one of the letters had
been misplaced......yes! it had! XYZYZ.

All of a sudden the cave became very dark...even the flashlight did little to
illuminate the room...there was a noise from the mouth of the cave..a sound
like a vault door beeing closed. From deep within the cave the screah of a
bird could be heard. Everyone in the group gathered close together.
They were afraid...alone .... and trapped.


   The bird returned to its perch and sat there. Its only thoughts were of
irritability in the mornings due to lack of coffee.It did, however, manage
a brief flutter when Dierdre (another of the younger children) tripped over a
small wire-mesh cage. "Hey!" she called, her voice echoing through the cavern.
"I bet we could trap the cocatiel in this!" (She was immensely proud of knowing
the word "cocatiel", and used it even whenincorrect.)
   Carl grabbed the cage and jumped after the bird, narrowly missing it as it
fluttered to another perch in a panicked burst. His jump took him into the
norhtern wall, where the letters "MAGIC WORD XYZZY" were inexplicably back to
normal. "Kuso!" he cursed in Japanese. "It's all Reagan's fault."
   "No," replied Navrita (who used to be Suzi, but who had just changed her
name in a fit of pique). "I think it's the wand-- the bird is afraid of it."
   "It's STILL all reagan's fault," muttered Carl, who had not changed his
name once this story but felt one coming on nonetheless. Still, after tossing
the artifact to another of his band, he managed to get the bird in the cage
(though it did squawk something about wanting to talk to its lawyer).

   [Suddenly, and inexplicably, the scene of our story shifts to outer space.
Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia are on board the Death Star, escaping from
the Imperial Guards.]

   LUKE: "Down here, Leia!" (They run down a corridor only to bump into two
	 armoured troopers. Seeing their weapons, our heroes drop theirs and
	  raise their hands in surrender.)
   TROOPER #1 (into intercom): "Control station, this is Lieutenants Gordon
	      and Rogers. We have captured the prisoners. Proceeding to
	      detention block 023 as per orders. Over."
   INTERCOM: "Roger." (pause) "Gordon, new instructions. Prisoners are to be
	      bound and gagged, then transported to the block under Lord
	      Vader's command... number 7."
   TROOPER #1: "Bond and 007, roger. More to come?"
   INTERCOM: "Negative. Control out."
   TROOPER #2: "Alright, we only have one set of handcuffs so this is what
		we'll do. Have the male lie in the corner of the elevator, face
		down; I'll sit on top of him to keep him from escaping.  The
		female will stand in the opposite corner, with your blaster
		trained on her.  Got that, Gordon?"

   TROOPER #1: "Right."
   LEIA: "Look, I think I have a plan. When the big one sits on you, throw him
	  off." (whispers)
   LUKE: "But what about the one with the blaster?"
   LEIA: "I'll open my coat and distract him."
   LUKE: "What good will that do?"
   LEIA: "I'm not wearing anything underneath!"
   LUKE: "Ohhh, I get it... you flash Gordon and I buck Rogers."
	  With that, we return to our story.


   Rommye, back to her REAL name, couldn't shake the feeling that they had to
go deepeer into the collosal cavern to do anything. She led the group down a
twisty little passageway but stopped short.
   "What's wrong?" asked Carl, who decided not to change his name after all
since Rommye/Suzi/Navrita/etc already had.
   "Look," she pointed out with a quivering hand. The young man followed it
to the biggest serpent either had seen outside of their high school (but that's
another story).
   "Snakes," Carl moaned. "Why does it always have to be snakes?"


  The sound of running feet came from behind them.  A tall, good looking boy
without a stitch of clothes on ran into the caves.  "Boy!" he said.  "You
could roast marshmallows on the sidewalk!"

   "Why should we?" asked Suzi, after she had gotten over snickering.
   "It's all Reagan's fault," the nude youth muttered, and disappeared without
a trace(well, actually he DID leave a trace, but nobody noticed it so it's
not particularly important). They soon forgot about him in lieuu of more
important things.

  The marshmallows were delicious; the silence was endless; but when Carl
screamed, "XYZZY", Rommye wanted to ask,"Why, too?", but a deep voice rang
out,"Cave closing soon."
  "Boy! You could roast more marshmallows in the street."
   "Or a cockatiel."
   "Shut up."

   As they entered a new portion of the place, they were amazed to find out
that they were utterly and completely lost. They were in a tiny little maze of
passageways, all alike. And there they stayed for some time.

   Twelve years later, when they had finally found a way out, the world was
fresh and green again. "Guess that blows all the 'nuclear winter' theories to
hell," noted Stanislaw (Carl, after all this time, had decided to change his
name too). Marshmallow trees and cockatiels abounded, and all the people in
the land were happy. Nobody hit each other with nasty objects any more, and
they even talked kindly to inanimate objects that had inadvertantly caused them
injury. Although the climate was so mild clothes were not neccesary, every man
wore a hat so he could tip it politely to ladies in the street. No one pirated
software, and there were always good, heart-warming shows on television.

   It was so boring that the group decided to go back into the cave and pretend
they were still teenagers.

   Yet, can time be fooled by simple shenanigans?  Apparently so, for in the
cave the group prospered and partied.

   This dream that Hursbug (she changed her name again) had would have been
nice, but she awoke to find it that-- only a dream.  She looked around.

    There was a group of people standing about, whispering to each other
about how pretty and innocent she looked while asleep.
     She sneezed violently, without warning.
Everyone saw what Hursbug was hiding in her mouth.

   It was a marshmallow.

       =-=-=-=THE END=-=-=-=

Well, not really. "It's all Reagan's fault," muttered Noriko (ex-Hursbug et al)
as she woke up to find herself still lost in a maze of tiny little passageways,
all alike. "But if you have a dream of waking up while you're asleep, does that
mean that you're still dreaming, only you think you're awake? Or does it mean
that you've awakened at the moment you dreamed you had?"
   "I never worry about that, myself," explained the creature that suddenly
appeaed next to her, waggling its eight eyestalks in a bored fashion. The
ground tilted and they both plunged into a dark shaft, illumined only by the
occasional underground rooms they passed. "Oh dear, I shall be too late,"
moaned the somewhat ball-shaped monster, as it checked a large pocket watch
which was of course digital. Alice--Oops! Sorry--Noriko considered grabbing
a jar from a passing shelf, but thought that would be unfair to the person who
owned it.
   "Oh dear, I wish I hadn't voted Libertarian in that last election," she
sighed. "I seem to remember them saying something about repealing the law of
Gravity, since the forces of nature shouldn't interfere with our private lives.
I wonder if it will be at all painful when I land?"
   She didn't have long to wait...

   But the dreamt impact woke her up (again).
Suddenly, THUMP! she came down on a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the
fall was over, just in time for winter.
   Noriko was now in a long hallway, lit by a row of lamps hanging from the
ceiling. There were doors all around, but they were locked; after trying them
all Noriko wondered sadly just how"SP+ was going to get out.
   Then an idea came into her pretty little head: The marshmallow! Chewing it
up thoroughly, then extracting it (which made the audience, unknown to the
girl, grimace as one), she shaped it into a key and waited for it to harden.
Hours later, it did. (Noriko amused herself by solving multivariable
integrations all the while.) She then went around and tried the key in all of
the doorlocks, only to find that they still would not open.
   "It's all Reagan's fault," she sniffled as she sat down on the huge, orange
sign reading "THIS WAY TO EXIT" pointing down to a partially open hatchway.

  MEANWHILE , IN THE EYE OF ORION, THE DOCTOR HAD JUST FINISHED EPAIRING THE
TARDIS.  HIS COMPANION TEGAN JOVANKA LOOKE SKEPTICAL.  AND FOR GOOD REASON -
THERE WAS A TERRIBLE HISSING SOUND AND THE TARDIS EXPLODED.

   A spider walked up to Noriko and asked for her name.
   She thought for a bit and said, "Call me Joanna.  My parents did."  She had
always led convincingly.
   "Well, Joanna," said the spider,"Why are you looking so gloomy? The sun is
up, the sky is blue.... It's beautiful, and so are you.  Is something wrong?
You look ever so sad."
   "There's this pest who just won't leave me alone."
   "Lead me to him!  I eat pests.  It's a hobby."
   Joanna smiled.  "Thou'rt him.  Go away."
   Naturally the spider's mind, tiny as it was, couldn't even take this little
paradox and exploded. After Joanna cleaned the spider goop off of her clothes,
she decided that she'd amused the audience enough and tromped down the
hatchway. Suddenly:
FROM AC666: J.R. "Bob" Dobbs is entering chat channel 13
   "My goodness, what ARE those annoying messages that pop by every so often?"
the girl wondered. Such thoughts ran like roaches exposed to light, though,
wwhen she found (actually almost tripped over) a shiny brass lantern sitting on
the top step. She took it as the way down seemed dark indeed, and at the bottom
of the staircase saw a shiny sword embedded in rock.
   Imagining all sorts of things, mostly centering around the E.B. White story
of the same name, she tried to extract the sword in the stone. But it was to no
avail. The only thing she got was tired.

From/S202 AC999.DATANET1/: Mr. Ronald Reagan is entering chat channel 84.
   "Pushy, pushy," Joanna thought.  "Well, I guess I'll chat with him."
She stopped reading the story, and entered channel 84.	"Hi, RR."
    "Hi, Joanna.  Is that your real name?  What computer are you using?"

   "That's really none of your business, Mr. Reagan.  Oh, and by the way, are
you for or against gun control?"

   "Well, I think every person in America should have guns." he said.

   "I'm glad you said that."  She picked up a colt-45 and put five bullets into
his brain.

    AS ALL OF THIS WAS ON NATIONAL TV, EVERYONE SAW IT.  THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HAD
A 100 YEAR CELEBRATION.  WHEN IT WAS OVER THE DOCTOR, PRESIDENT OF THE TIMELORD
COUNCIL(NEWLY APPOINTED) WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSE AND LEELA OF THE
SEVATEEM WAS VICE-PRESIDENT AND K9 WAS MINISTER OF DEFENSE.  [Oh my God- The
new Doctor Who board has invaded the novel!!!]

   "Whew, thank goodness this was just another of those stupid dreams," Akemi
noted as she woke up. "Some of it all in caps, too. It's all Reagan's fault,"
she continued.
   Replacing her broom-handled Mauser in its fine-grain buffalo hide sheath
(and snickering at the thought of a mere Colt) she mused for a while on the
saying by Robert Heinlein, "An armed society is a polite society", then went in
search of a way out. Hopefully she would not fall victim to hallucinations
sent by supporters of the losing side ever again.

  She turned a corner to find the other group having wild and passionate sex,
so she turned into another corridor.  She gaped in awe at the sight of five
20 megaton bombs, just sitting there,
ticking away.

   "Hmmmm....." she said.  "I think this novel is at an end."

   "A second later, her atoms were flying across the planet in every
direction."

   "Oh no, not again," said one of the atoms to the other.

   "Yup," said the other atom, "And this time it wasn't Reagan's fault,
'cause he went up with the first wave."

   "I know," said the first atom, "Hey - those stupid Mondale/Ferraro
campaign posters are still all over.  Even nukes can't get rid of the
damn things.  And they were supposed to be such great enviromnentalists!"

   "Uh, oh - looks like we're gonna coalesce into something again.  At
least we still get to stay together."

   "Yup - talk to ya later>"

As the atoms (and many, many more) begin to come together again, a shape
starts to become fuller with each passing moment.  After several hours,
the process is complete.


   The Earth, tired and weary, looked up.  This is ridiculous, he thought.  "
These overgrown apes are sending me to peices.	 Enough is enough."  The Earth
held it's breath for a second, then exploded in a huge fireball.  The moon,
seeing what the Earth was going to do, left orbit and took cover behind the
planet Venus.

   "Venuse
   "Yes?" came a deep voice.
   "It's all Reagan's fault." said the moon sadly.

   "Yes I know."  Venus started to cry over it's lost sister , then exploded
itself.

    new novel -- "

   Something's alive -- in the closet

	   by users- DATANET 3000


   It was a dark and stormy night.

Lightning an thunder were scaring the ltlle child to death. Her name was Susie a
nd she was only 5. Then, she heard it. There was a rattling in her closet, she s
screamed! From downstairs came the weary voice of her father,"Susie, be quiet! i
It is only a storm."
Susie tried to keep quiet but she was very scared. she heard the rattling again.
Then, the door slowly opened. A man with a suit riding a horse came out.
 He said,"Hi I'm Ron Reagan. What'S your name?"
  "I am not allowed to talk to strange men on horses," she said.  "Daddy!" she
called.  "The President's in my closet again."
   Her father hurried upstairs.  "So you finally came out of the closet, Ron?"
   "Yes," Reagan admitted.  "I am a homosexual and proud of it."
   "And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have
commited abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be
upon them.    Leviticus 20, verse 13," said Susie before killing Reagan.

  "You bathtards!"" screamed Walter Mondale, running out of the bathroom with
whipped cream all over his private parts. "You killed Ronnie!"

  With a terrible scream, Fritz jumped out the second floor bay window,
splattering his body on the driveway.

  "Shit - he still has all those silly campaign posters all over the place,
and now he goes and messes up the drive!", moaned Susie.  "And that Ferarro
woman is in Gimbels on a buying spree 'cause she isn't vice president."


  Susie's mother Jeanne, arriving home in her Buick Regal from a fairly late
Suburban Housewives meeting, flashed on her high beams as she rolled into the
drive, brightly illuminating the pile of gore and whipped cream that smeared the
pavement.  Bringing the car to a sudden halt, she stepped out and observed the
mess.  She noted the broken window, pursed her lips disapprovingly, and
poked at the decimated corpse with one beige mid-heel spectator pump.

Suddenly the world was full of ..........

	       ASPARAGUS!!!!!!!
	      ----------------

Imagine, a world full of that great vegtable !!!!!


[Yes! And imagine the heroines of this novel all doing squat jumps in
a field full of that great vegetable ...]

New on-line novel:

		 "It's All Reagan's
		     Fault"

     by: the Data-Net 3000 Users

   Suddenly, all the stars from the previous two stories got together in one
room. It was a large room, full of people... all kinds. And they had all
arrived at the same building at more or less the same time. And they were all
free. And they were all asking themselves the same question: "What... is
behind... that curtain?"

   "Hey," Carl noted, Why is politics like broken hearts?"
   "Why?" asked all of Marianne's various pseudonyms, in perfect harmony.
  "Because both are for assholes!" continued the young man, cleverly alluding
to the Frank Zappa song. As a unit, everyone in the room brought out their
weapons and killed him.
   "Seriously, though," continued the strong female lead, "the ninnies and
twits have ruined the proceedings in this section. Some people can't relax for
a second... once their tiny little brains latch onto a thought, they don't let
go. The thought dies of lonliness and they log on here, putting junk into a
collaberation which was previously reasonably amusing and spoiling the fun for
the real users."
   "What's the solution, Noriko?" asked Susie's father, who had always liked
that name the best.
   She shook her head. "Within the current system, there IS none. You'll get
morons wherever you are. It would take a rewrite of the whole Blabb program
to do anything. As an example, if every statement left could be attributed
to someone we could at least find out who the creeps are, and take action that
way. But for that, something as drastic as putting the user number before the
text, kind of like a sub-title, would have to be written in."
   "Gasp!" the crowd gasped.
   "Or," she continued, swinging a booted heel over the corpse of her late
friend and walking to a nearby chair, "there could be addition by invitation
only. The best writers (or, at least, the ones with brains enough to stick to
a subject instead of petty ranting) would be allowed to add lines, while all
the other users could read their work. New authors could be admitted on a trial
basis; if ty didn't obey the few
rules for blabnovels, they could be easily dismissed."
   "But... that would mean having the program look up names in a list!"
wailed a little girl that no one remembered. "Do you think the Data-Net sysops
are up to it?"
   "I don't know that, either," Sheryl admitted. "I guess we'll just have to
wait and see."
   "It's all Reagan's fault," burbled the not-quite-dead body of Carl, so they
all shot him again.
	  *** THE END ***


   The man holding up the "*** THE END ***" sign was shot, and crumpled to the
floor.

   "Sheesh!" said Marlene, changing her name once again.  "You're right in the
middle of a novel and some complete jerk off walks in and tries to end it.
What nerve!"

    Just then a small nuclear warhead in diapers crawled onto the stage.  He
looked up at June (who one again changed her name) and smiled.	"Goo goo" it
said.

   Janet bent down and looked at it.  "Hmmm..  20 megatons.  Well, I guess it's
all Ronald Raygun's fault." she shrugged.

   Bill picked up the baby nuke and belched it.  He then took a screwdirver and
ended it's life.

   "Bill! It's still ticking!  Do you know what that means?"

   "Yes.  It mean we have 3 seconds to live.  After that, the Datatek computer
is going to explode in the firestorm of a 20,000,000 tons of tnt explosion."


     "Wait a minute!" said the Datatek computer.  "You suckers ain't
blowing me to kingdom cum!"

     "That's come, not cum" piped in Jeaine.

     "Whatever.  You ain't doing it. With that he  beeped  and exploded."

BBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!

THE DATATEK COMPUTER IS NO MORE! AND THE SAME FOR THIS STORY!!!

END OF SUBSYSTEM

CPU=3;CONNECT=5;BOOM!!!!!


   Meanwhile, Julie (changing her name again)'s atoms were being mixed with
the remains of the earth (who exploded too) ..

  "My -- what a mess -- talk about a traffic jam!" said Atom #1.

  "Well," said a hunk of an atom, sneaking up behind the first atom," it's good
to be a group.	Talk about a gang bang!"

   "Hmmmm.." said atom #1 seductively," you are a pretty one.  Want to go to
my place and form some ionic bonds?"

   "Ahhh.. now you've got my electons excites.  Let's go"  and as the two atoms
went to go have ionic sex, the rest of the universe started to collapse.  ALl
the atoms crammed into one huge globe, destroying everything.  For a few bill-
ion years, they stayed there in a huge glowing ball, untill the pressure caused
a large explosion which sent them all across the universe.  Another uni- verse
was created.

  "Oh no, not again," said atom #1, lying back, lighting up a ciggarette.
   "YEP, BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD" SAID ATOM #2
   "YOU KNOW ATOM#1 I THINK WE SHOULD GET RID OF THIS IDIOTIC RIDICULOUS STORY T

New BlabNovel:
   "Do YOU know where your towel is?"
   (based on the "Hitchhiker" books by Douglas Adams)

   It was a rather steamy Tuesday in 1858. The Mongol hordes had been massing
at the city gates for a fortnight; panic in the streets was the rule. Soon, the
city fathers realized, they would have enough strength to storm the high wall
surrounding the mercantile center; after that, the town was doomed.
   "Oh, stop looking so gloomy," Malthazor grumbled. "It isn't like it was the
end of the world, you know." Shifting his rather bulky form into a more
comfortable position, he continued "I've seen these hordes before. A little
looting, some rape and senseless violence, and maybe a burning or two and
they're off. Really, they have the attention span of voles."
   This soliliquy, oddly enough, seemed to have the reverse effect that the
merchant intended. The thin and pale man in the corner (to whom Malthazor had
been offhandedly speaking) merely huddled deeper into his blanket, if indeed
that was possible. "And what if we're in the middle of this looting, burning,
mass murder, and other assorted atrocities?" a he asked in a quavering voice.
   "Could be worse," the heavier man mused. "We could be out of food." As if on
cue, a town crier ran past screaming "THE FOOD'S GONE!"
   "Right," said Malthazor. "Time to act. Come on, are you coming or not?"
   For the first time since the novel began the skinny wretch showed his face
from beneath the blanket. It was not a particularly momentuous occasion. As
with most inhabitants of the village, he was a vastly plain sort of human--
just the sort that directors search for when they cast crowd scenes, so as not
to draw attention from the highly-paid stars. "Coming?" he echoed, and as the
reader has probably already guessed, not in a particularly pleasing voice.
"Coming where? Going for a little walk, are we? Right, let's just ask our old
friend Genghis if we can take a bit of a stroll. I'm sure he thinks highly of
us, otherwise he'd have picked another village to plunder, hm?" With that he
redoubled his effort to become a true piece of the floor.
   As it turned out, a wasted effort. In spite of himself the inconsequential
townsman (a curd-churner by profession) peered out of his security blanket upon
hearing an unearthly noise from his
large friend's general direction. Once he saw the device rapidly growing
under the direction of Malthazor, timidity gave way to curiosity, without even
an attempt from common sense to stop what was obviously the wrong decision.
The young churl edged closer and closer as the light radiating from the
machine grew in intensity, until with a noise that was rather an anticlimax...
   ...the two men were suddenly in a metal room filled with strange boxes and
materials.
   "Witchcraft," concluded the yeoman, pleased that he had intuitively grasped
the obvious. The resigned grin still on his face, he fainted dead away. In a
gesture of almost-human kindness, the fat man covered his feet with the moldy
blanket before disassembling his machine and settling down for a nap as well.
   "Hmmm, it seemed to work for him," he mused. "WITCHCRAFT!" Melthazor
suddenly blurted in a stage whisper, then waited for a second as if something
was supposed to happen. When, alas, the sleep charm did not take effect, the
rotund individual wrapped himself in his voluminous cape and counted sheep.


  Before he could sleep long, Melthazor was awakened by a screech of metal.
The ceiling of the roof peeled off and a passing maniac climbed in, fingered
his nose at him, grabbed him, and took
off in the hole in the roof.
     I sit here, contemplating my miserable existence and wondering if there
is anything more to life than merely makig the best of the situation in which
I find myself.	I think at times that there is no order to the universe, no
central structure that unites all of us and our acocomplishment, nothing that
will make sense of it all in the end.  In other words, I begin to question the
existence of God, and my friends, I come up empty.  Why, for example, do I sit
her at 2:30 a.m. on a Sunday morning, blabbing to individuals who may or may
not read these words.  I write, and yet, I talk only to myself.  I gratify my
eago without give an iota about the rest of creation.  Do we have a purpose?
Or are we just an accident, conceived in a moment of passion and thrown into
a world which seeks to endow us with certain social bagge.  The world says that
I am a student; but am I a student or am I more than this?  Am I less than this
perhaps?  The latter proposition frightens me even the more, for it suggests
that I have no purpose in and of myself.  But if this is true, then I can merely
make a place for myself in this hell that we call human existence by trying to
define myself in terms of my relationship to the rest of humanity.

     I think that there is no value in me but that which others say I have and
that if 3 of 4 individuals agree that I do not existence, there is a strong
possibility that indeed I do not exist.  If everyone said that I did not exist,
there would not even be a question.  Though I would walk upon the earth and I
would be certain in my own mind that I existed, I could not and would not exist
if other individuals said that I did not, just as colors do not exist for a
blind man, and if they do, they make no difference to the way in which he con-
ducts himself, for he does not conduct himself within the realm of visual sen-
sory data at all, but on the contrary, the auditory world becomes important to
him in a way that the sighted individual cannot understand, for it is not so
important to the latter individual.  The sighted individual, while he ackowled-
ges the auditory world, can never appreciate it in the way a blind man can, for
this is all the blind man czn know.

	I guess that what I am trying to say is that existence is brought into
being by individuals who observe and say, "Yes, it exists and I will conduct
myself in a way which acknowledges its (whatever it may be) existence."  What
we choose to ignore cannot exist and do not let anyone tell you that, when left
to oneself, the individual can find vale within himself.  I have always been
told that KING LEAR `by william Shakespeare is about a man who must look for
value within himself.  Well, it is my favorite Shakespearean play and I think
it touches most pointedly upon certain themes.	but upon making the observation
to my brother that this was my favorite play, he, who is a candidate for a
Ph.D. in Literature said to me, "Ah, you like that play because it borders on
nihilism."  And, you know, I think he might be at least partially correct.
The work is nihilistic in this sense:  It is the search of an individual
for value outside the sphere of others, and hence, to me, it is a futile
attempt on the part of the protagonist.  Lear can search for value within
himself, but does he really find it?  Critics claim that all is redeemed at
the end of the play, and yet, everyone is dead:  Cordelia dies in her
father's arms and Lear dies of what seemes to be symbolically a broken heart.
Is this redemption?  I hesitate to say it is.  I think Lear searches in vain
and I cannot honestly say that he finds the value for which he is searching.
Why?  Because value lies not within the individual, but is bestowed upon the
individual by forces external to himself.

     Again I wonder if I have any value.  I think of the few close friends
I have for whom I might have some meaning and who I might have touched in these
past months and years.	Yet I am all too cognisant that these friends my turn
upon me if the opportunity is presented to them as has happened to me in the
past.  And therefore, I yet exercise a hermeneutics of suspicion with respect
to these friends and I wish I could say with some assuredness that I have value
and meaning for them.  But I cannot be sure.  I maintain my relation- ship with
these people as it is necessary for me as a social animal to do so.  Man does
not wish to be alone in any case and I, because I am a man, do not wish to be
alone.	And so, I maintain these relationships.  I say that I trust my friends
and they likewise trust me.  Am I sure of this?  Not at all.  Friendship is a
miniature social contract.

     I will fall asleep now and hope that I awaken with a renewed outlook
upon life.  I will always search for value.  Perhaps dwelling upon it is what
drives the brilliant men of the world insane.  And perhaps if I think too much
more about it, I will merely be driven to suicide...  Lear did not get that he
could have value within himself, without that value being acknowledged by his
peers.	Just as you believe in your existence being dependent on the
experiences of others.	You will believe in the majority, for they must know.
Well my friend, if Columbus had followed your philosopphy, he would never have
sailed across the sea, to prove that everyone was wrong and he was right.
There is no devine purpose for existence.  Make your own up.  Whatever it is
that works for you in life.  Saying life has no meaning, is a cop out.	It has
as much or as little as you allow it to have.  Life is a game of risking.  You
have choices.  You choose what you want out of life, based on your beliefs of
the world, and the values you place on life.  You judge whether the price you
must pay is worthy of the reward to be gained.	That is risking.  Sometimes you
choose what seems to be the lesser risk.  Often the "easy" way is not
necesarily the best way.  But it's always you who chooses.  No one makes you
choose.  So, I say to you sir, that if you shall choose to give up in life, and
lay down and die, there is nothing I or anyone can do to make you do otherwise.
However, if you choose to play the game of life, and make a difference in the
world, than I give you my support, and I am committed to assisting you in
reaching your goal.

As a bit of assistance, I (someone other than the above commentator) urge
you to consider embracing a polytheistic religion.  Man's relationship to
his God (singular) is rather insular; throw in a few more deities and you
have a party.  Remember: "Two is company, three is a menage, more is ... "
I think the polytheism stuff is a great idea.  the more the merrier!  but really
idea and well said (even though we should be writing a novel)
so, what's the title of this?
     Cage wrote,"It is not irritating to be where one is.  It is merely
irritating to think that one should like to be somewhere else."
     When I read this, I could not but read it again.
     "It is not irritating to be where one is.  It is merely irritating to
think that one should like to be somewhere else."
     If you think about it, you'll realize it's true.
     "It is not irritating to be where one is.  It is merely irritating to
think that one should like to be somewhere else."
     The same line appears again later in the essay.
     "It is not irritating to be where one is.  It is merely irritating to
think that one should like to be somewhere else."
     When you reread it, you understand it more fully.
     "It is not irritating to be where one is.  It is merely irritating to
think that one should like to be somewhere else."
     Where would you like to be?
     "It is not irritating to be where one is.  It is merely irritating to
think that one should like to be somewhere else."
     Does it not echo in your mind?
     "It is not irritating to be where one is.  It is merely irritating to
think that one should like to be somewhere else."
     Time beats on.
     "It is not irritating to be where one is.  It is merely irritating to
think that one should like to be somewhere else."
hmmm...yeah, there is a slight echo there!
perhaps it's just me....I dunno....
but that's pretty deep and does make a good point.  I always seem to consider
that where I want to be may require a GREAT risk which could perhaps leave me
in a worse position than I am now, but then WHAT do I have to lose?  hmmm....

=========================================================================================
				"Angel's Fur"
				     By
				Piper Sickles



  Har!	Har!  Har!

  The raucous guffaws made me jump in my seat.	Nobody laughs like that outside
of the funny papers.  Besides, "The Bishop's Wife" didn't have any belly laughs
that I could recall.  Especially not (I looked at the screen) in the scene
where Cary Grant is comforting Loretta Young.

  A snort and loud chuckles followed.  It quickly became obvious that the 30
other people in the university auditorium agreed with me about old Loudmouth's
sense of humor.  But why were they all ssshh!- ing at _me_?

  I forced my attention back to the screen.  God, now David Niven was berating
Loretta again.	Damned hypocritical minister, spending all his time and energy
pushing for promotion and blaming his wife for not being understanding when all
she wanted was a little love.

  I knew just how she felt.  Ray used to pull exactly that sort of garbage on
me.  Staying at the office forever and bringing his work home, but insisting
that I have supper ready whenever he brought the boss for "pot luck".
Belittling my political work and anything else I did that wasn't a step toward
becoming Mrs.  Wonderful Corporate Wife.

  Our story hadn't had a happy ending, though.

  Happy endings.  I didn't often see the endings of movies these days -- the
good ones always hit a sore spot and started me thinking about the bad old days
before the divorce.  Or about the good times.

  I only knew this movie had a happy ending because Ray and I'd seen it when we
were dating, when it seemed as if every story had a happy ending, especially
ours.

  Har har har to that, I thought sourly.

  Not that Ray would have listened to an angel, anyway.  Why listen to an angel
when you know you have a direct line to God?  Not ( as I told him a zillion
times) that I would want to spend eternity in a heaven run by his smug,
self-righteous deity.  So I wound up in the registrar's office, typing "You'd
be more than eligible to graduate with honors this semester if you'd just taken
three more hours at Our Fine University.  Since you haven't, tough rocks," to
students who didn't want to hear that.  Not quite hell, but near enough.

  Damn!  I'd done it again!  -- the credits were scrolling across the screen.

  I reached for my coat.  Gee, I thought, if I could just start the film again
for myself ...	If Loretta could have changed her movie, would she have edited
Niven out before Cary showed up?

  I was thinking about that when somebody touched my shoulder.

  I jumped, stifled a yelp, and realized it was just Al, the manager.  The
theater was empty except for us.

  "Lizbeth, it's time to go.  I'm ready to lock up."

  "Sorry Al, I was thinking." I blushed and stood up.

  "Hey kid, you ought to find a friend to come to these movies with, or join
some of the others at the grill afterwards.  I hate to see you hide yourself
away like this."

	"Al, you know most of the others are kids -- bright-eyed and
still thinking they can change the world.  I know better."

  "Right.  You're past your prime.  An old lady at 34.


  "By the way, take your damn cat with you."


  "What are you talking about?"

  "Your cat.  Right there."

  He pointed to the seat on my other side.

  A sorry-looking grey-and-black tiger was looking up at me.  It appeared
well-fed and wore a dirty collar, but the fur was matted, one ear had been
chewed and blood was clotted around a messy cut along one side of its face.

  "That is not my cat.  It obviously belongs to somebody, though -- look at the
collar.  Keep it here."

  "No way.  My wife is allergic and if I bring home any cat dander she won't be
fit to live with.  Give me a break, Liz -- take it for tonight anyway."

  The cat looked at me and gave a plaintive "merowww".  Its eyes were running
and it sneezed.

  "Okay, but put up a notice that you found him.  I'll check back after
Thursday's film."

  "Sure.  Thanks a million, Liz."

  I reached for the cat and it seemed to leap into my arms.

  "Okay, angel, come with Liz," I cooed like an idiot.  It started to purr as I
scratched the ear that wasn't mangled.

  I walked home with the cat tucked inside my raincoat, muttering that we'd
soon need an ark if it kept raining.

  The cat poked its head out, looked up at me and said "I don't think the boss
has that in mind, actually."

	This was it, I thought -- I'd finally lost my mind.

  I got to my door, put the cat down, went to the kitchen and poured myself a
large glass of Cella.

  Eyeing the cat, which was looking as smug as an Egyptian statue if somewhat
less elegant, I placed the glass carefully onto the coffee table.  Then I took
off my dripping coat and hung it up.

  I fell onto the sofa and dug into my purse for my cigarettes, found one, and
nervously lit it.  "You have got to get out with people more," I lectured
myself.  "Look at you, vegetating in this hole, going to fantasy movies -- no
wonder you think you hear cats talking to you.	Get that brochure out and take
that exercise course.  You can meet people and get thin at the same time."

  The cat strolled into the room, looked at me intently, and jumped onto the
sofa next to me.  He stared at me a moment, blinked, and said, "Lizbeth, I'm
hungry."

  My body went rigid.

  "That's it!  A cat talked to me twice.  Time to call Dr.  Kered," I
announced.

  Dr.  Kered was on staff at the university's psychology department.  He did
private counseling on the side.  When my marriage was in trouble, I saw him
regularly.  Ray had refused to go.  Eventually, I realized I'd be happier
without Ray and could manage on my own.

  The cat looked at me again and said "Lizbeth, you are not hallucinating, but
I'm very hungry and I will not explain a thing to you until I am fed."

  I didn't care what it said.  I was hallucinating.  However, I decided, I
might as well play along.  The hallucination wanted to eat; OK, I'd get it
something to eat.

  I went back to the kitchen and rooted around my cluttered cupboards,
wondering what I could get a cat to eat.  I loathed fish, so I knew I didn't
have any tuna.	Finally I found a can of chunk chicken, opened it, and put it
in an empty cream cheese dish.

  "Thank you.  Could I also have something to drink?  Some of your Cella would
be nice."

  "Cat, I know I am hallucinating, but let me tell you -- even in a
hallucination I am not giving a cat wine.  Water for you.!"

  I looked around for another cream cheese dish, found one under my African
violet, washed it out and filled it with water.  I watched the cat eat.  He was
tidy and precise.  No gobbling or spilling food all over for this one.	He
cleaned the dish of chicken, drank his fill and said "Let's go back to the
sofa.  We'll be more comfortable."

  I nodded automatically and followed him back to the living room.  I was
getting used to talking to a cat.  He jumped up to the sofa, and I sat down
beside him.

  "First of all I want to reassure you that I am talking to you.  I may look
like a cat on this trip, but you are not crazy.  You need help and the boss
sent me.

  "She figures we can help each other."

  "That's the second time you've mentioned your boss.  Who is he?"

  "She" he corrected.  "God."

  "God?!" I shouted.  "God is female?!"

  "God," he said quietly.  "She's been worried about you."

  "You cannot be for real.  I don't buy any of that religious claptrap, I don't
go to church, and I don't think God is going to go out of his way to help me."

  "Her way," the cat corrected gently.  "Besides, what do you know about God?
God doesn't believe in churches either:  She often says the most humane people
are the unlikely ones.	She knows a lot of churches are full of people who
believe in intolerance and war, and have only crocodile tears for Her
unfortunates."

  "WOW.  Do you mean God is a Democrat?"

  "No, I mean God is The Democrat.  She likes humans who have 'bleeding heart'
tendencies.  You have them.  She likes that."

  "But why me?  I'm not happy, heaven knows, but I'm not too badly off.  I have
a roof over my head, a job, and food.  Surely there is someone needy out there
you could be helping."

  "Yeah, and so could you.  That's part of the point of this charade.  Bleeding
hearts aren't any use if all they do is drip on the floor."

  "Dammit, cat, don't lecture me.  I used to try, and it never got anybody
anywhere.  Especially me.  All it ever got me was into fights with Ray."

  "Lizbeth, Lizbeth.  As Dr.  Kered would say, you're buying into Ray's image
of you.

  "Dr.  Kered would be disappointed in you.  He thought you'd developed some
self esteem.  Not to mention some fight."

  "Listen, cat, I do okay.  What's this have to do with my self esteem and
fight?"

  "Lots.  You know who's senior senator in this state.  God has decided that
you should help Her elect a better senator.  A liberal, fair person."

  "Why doesn't she just turn Creepy Claudette and all her commie -fearing
followers into liberals?"

  "The rules don't work that way.  You must have heard that the Lord helps
those who help themselves.

  "Anyway, God wants you to help Paul Savits win the election.  You have some
political experience, you have heart, and you're very convincing when you
believe in somebody.  I'm here to help you make the decision to jump into the
fray."

  "Now I know I'm crazy.  I have nothing to offer a big-time politician like
Savits.  Sure, I stuffed envelopes and watched polls, but I haven't been
involved in politics for years."

  "God knows.  She's been watching you and She's convinced you can do it, now
that you no longer have that insufferable husband around.  By the way, why did
you marry such a conservative fellow?  Surely it wasn't to be taken care of?
You can do that yourself."

  "Yeah, Ray was pretty bad, wasn't he?  It used to infuriate me when he ranted
about how well people lived on welfare.  And I _am_ taking care of myself.
What else do you want me to do?"

  "Just trust yourself.  I only stopped by to tell you to trust your instincts,
and to trust in divine guidance."

  "Divine guidance.  What makes you think I would even recognize it?"

  "Lizbeth, for all your romantic tendencies, you always play it safe.  You're
liberal politically, but in your daily life you are more practical and
constrained than Ray was, or ever thought of being.

  The way will be there.  Just grab the opportunity and run with it.  Don't
think of the safety play."

  "What way?"

  "I can't tell you that, but I know it'll be there."

  "By the way, cat, just what are you?"

  "An angel, of course.  Har!  Har!  Har!"

  "You were the one laughing at the film!"

  "Oh, yes, my dear.  Cary Grant is charming, but the way angels are portrayed
in that movie is pure fiction.	God doesn't give any of us that much power.
Besides, what good would it do to have an angel visit you and not be able to
remember it?"

  Even for a hallucination, something didn't make sense.

  "Look," I said.  "If you're an angel, what the hell are you doing all torn up
like that?"

  "Well, I wouldn't have done any good if I'd shown up in a form you wouldn't
have any truck with, would I?  And as for being torn up ...  well, as I said,
if something's worth believing in, it's worth fighting for.  And in this
incarnation, I discovered that I believed in a female cat.

  "Now, Lizbeth, I must be going.  Get a good night's rest and trust yourself."

  He jumped off the sofa, walked to the mat, and said, "Please open the door."

  I moved to the door, turned the handle, felt him rub against my legs in
farewell and watched him walk down the street.	The rain had stopped, the moon
was full, and the stars were out.  It was a beautiful misty night.

  I stood there for awhile, long after the cat had moved out of sight.	I
sighed, went back to the living room, finished my wine, and went to bed.

  I slept fitfully that night.	In the morning, I realized it all must have
been a very strange dream.

  I was thinking about it when the doorbell rang.  I threw on a robe and
answered it.  The mailman had a special delivery letter from Jack Black, the
local Democratic party chairman.  Apparently the committeewoman from my
district had to have an operation.  None of the people under her was willing to
take on her duties, but several had remembered me.  My district was a pivotal
one, he wrote.	Would I consider it?

  I shivered at the coincidence.  It was as if my dream had turned real.  I was
excited at the thought of getting involved in politics again.  I had a lot of
ideas.	Maybe I _could_ contribute some spark and creative suggestions.  And
who knows -- if I pulled the precinct for Savits, maybe I'd get an even better
offer -- one with pay!	Then I could tell the registrar's office what to do
with its form letters ...

  Instead of falling into a daydream, I stepped briskly into the kitchen to
brew some strong coffee.

  "Okay, God, I'll give it my best shot," I said out loud, and grinned to
myself.

  Then I picked up the empty cream cheese dishes and tossed them into the sink.

			Before the Beyond

  A nurse quietly entered Avery's hospital room.  She was young, barely out of
her teens, but gifted with true compassion and feeling for her patients.
Gently, without disturbing his sleep, she slid her right hand around Avery's
thin, bony wrist.  His pulse was weak and slow, but steady.  For awhile she
stood, his aged and bent fingers resting in her smooth and caring young hands.
She looked upon Avery's time-warn face as she would the towering trees of an
ancient redwood forest--with awe and wonder of life which began so long ago.  A
tear welled in her eye.  It was a tear of sorrow, it was a tear of joy, it was
a tear for life so fully lived.

  Avery was old.  The ravages of life long-lived were apparent:  lines of
laughter splayed from the outer corners of his eyes, lines of sorrow drooped
from the corners of his mouth.	His long white hair lay tangled and unkempt,
his gnarled and arthritic hands lay useless at his sides.  Less apparent were
the insidious ailments of the aged:  eyes that could no longer see, ears that
could no longer hear, teeth that no longer were.  Crippled by arthritis and
brittle bones, he was unable to walk.  Cancer was spreading.  Avery was dying.

  Opening the door to leave, the young nurse glanced one last time at the old
man lying on his deathbed.  It was the last time she would see him alive--it
was the last time anyone would see him alive.

  Moments after the nurse left the room Avery began to stir.  He opened his
tired and useless eyes, and nervously looked about as if searching for
something, for somebody.  Avery's attention drew to the foot of his bed.  His
eyes seemed to focus on something, but nothing was there.  Avery smiled weakly
and relaxed.  His eyes sparkled; they showed no fear.

  "So, you've finally caught up with me," said Avery, seemingly to himself.  He
continued to stare straight ahead at nothing, at something.  "I've expected
your coming for some time now, wished it in fact, ever since Catherine passed
away." Avery's face brightened as living images of his long dead wife passed
before his unseeing eyes.  "Catherine," he murmured wistfully, "She was my
friend you know--my best friend." The senile fogginess of Avery's mind cleared,
leaving the meandering paths of his life memory unclouded; his thoughts drifted
into the past, to the moment his life with Catherine began.

  Avery met Catherine when she was eighteen years old and he, nineteen.
Catherine worked as a waitress; Avery was unemployed-- a typical casualty of
The Great Depression.  With a veritable fortune in his pocket, a quarter, Avery
entered Bernie's Cafe for a doughnut and coffee.  Being out of work, Avery
didn't usually indulge in such extravagance, but his fruitless search for work
that day and the preceding weeks had dampened his spirit.  He needed something
to lighten his dark mood.  Though not on the menu, Avery got exactly what he
wanted, exactly what he needed, in Bernie's Cafe:  lifting his eyes from his
gloom, Avery looked into the glowing face of the prettiest girl he'd ever seen.
It was Catherine.  She was neither beautiful nor glamorous; she was simply
pretty.  His first thought upon seeing her:  "I could spend the rest of my life
with that girl." And indeed he did.  Perhaps Catherine sensed their destiny,
for she rashly changed her usual and brusque, "What'll it be," to a more
friendly, "May I take your order?"

  "Catherine was my life," Avery said.  "She made it all worthwhile.  She made
the good times better, and the bad times tolerable.  Catherine was always there
to see us through." The times of their life together became clear in his mind,
and he remembered them all.

  Avery and Catherine courted for less than a year before they married.  Avery
found work as an apprentice carpenter, they established a home, and Catherine
quit her job as waitress to become a housewife.  They raised three
children--two boys and a girl--and watched them grow into adults with lives and
families and problems of their own.  Their house seemed empty and their lives
without purpose after the youngest child moved away to begin his own life.
Avery and Catherine became closer than ever before.  Catherine took over the
job of bookkeeper for Avery's carpentry business, and together they worked,
relaxed, and enjoyed their latter years.  Then, seven years ago, Catherine died
of a sudden heart attack.  Avery was devastated.  He postponed his retirement
to keep busy and to keep his mind from his sorrow, but he couldn't keep up the
pace and had to retire anyway.	Catherine's death marked the end of the full
and happy life Avery had lived.  He spent the last few years waiting for his
life to end.  His children and their families tried to show their love and
concern, but their lives were busy and far away.

  Avery's awareness of the present gradually returned, and he again directed
his attention to the foot of his bed:  "Yeah, I remember," Avery answered.
"How could I ever forget?  Had Frank not pulled me out of the water when he
did, I'd of drowned for sure."

  Avery and his brother Frank were told over and over by their parents not to
go near Crawford Creek, but once in a while the two brothers found themselves
playing in and around the creek anyway.  On one such occasion, on a hot and
muggy July afternoon, they peeled off their clothes and plunged into the cool
clear water with the excitement of knowing that what they did was sneaky and
against the rules their parents had firmly established.  Frank was then
fourteen, two years older than Avery.  They played tag in the water, vigorously
chasing each other back and forth across the creek.  After a few minutes in the
water Avery doubled over in pain from a severe stomach cramp.  He was in the
middle of the creek, over the deepest part, and unable to touch bottom or keep
his head above the water to breathe.  After what seemed an interminable time to
Avery, Frank realized his brother was in trouble and pulled him to shore.

  "Frank saved my life that day," said Avery.  After a few moments of
reflection Avery spoke again, softly, "If only I could've returned the favor."
A few days after graduating from high school, Frank got a job in
construction--building a bridge across Crawford Creek.	The bridge being built
was only a few hundred yards downstream from where Avery almost drown.	The
bridge spanned Crawford Creek at a place where the creek cut a deep gorge
through the earth.  A sudden gust of wind hit Frank while he walked untethered
along a girder; he lost his balance, and fell seventy feet to the creek below.
The water was not swift or deep or dangerous, but the fall knocked Frank
unconscious, and before any of his follow workers could get to him from the
bridge, he had drown.

  "That was a sad summer for us," said Avery.  "At Frank's funeral I saw Dad
cry for the first time--the only time.	And he didn't really cry, it was just a
tear, a single tear.  Mom and Dad were tough old Norwegians and, I guess, used
to such grief.	They became over-protective of me, however, after that."

  Avery's parents were Norwegian immigrants.  They came from a small village on
the shore of one of the many fingers of one of the many fjords that penetrate
the western coast of Norway.  They came from a hard life:  small, hard rock
farms that grew just enough produce and truck during the short summer to feed
them during the long nights and short days of winter.  Avery's mother came to
America to get away from Avery's father; Avery's father came to America to find
her.  Their first child died shortly after birth, but their next two children,
Frank and Avery, escaped the dangers of birth and grew healthy and strong.

  "My own children?  Oh, they were a great bunch of kids," said Avery with a
smile.	"If I had to choose the best time of my life, it would have to be the
years Catherine and I and our children were a family:  sharing the fun and the
troubles, and the growing up--all of us together."

  Avery and Catherine raised their three children like most parents:  eagerly
awaiting the first real words, eagerly awaiting the first unsupported steps,
then suddenly finding their babies leaving home for college or for jobs, or for
independence.  Avery had a strong hand in raising their children, but he
honestly and rightly gave most of the credit to Catherine.

  "Catherine," Avery murmured wistfully, again.  "God, how I've missed her
these last few years." Avery's thoughts drifted into the past once more, but
something disturbed his reverie:  "No, I'm not stalling," replied Avery,
seemingly to no one.  "There are so many people and places and times to
remember, so many regrets to forget." He continued to contemplate the past
until he saw each moment of his entire life coalesce into a single image, a
vision, like seeing the picture of a completed jigsaw puzzle after years of
seeing only its individual pieces.  His life complete, Avery was ready for the
beyond.

  "So, which way do we go, up or down?" Avery asked facetiously, but with faint
seriousness.  He listened intently as if hearing an answer to his question, but
there was no sound.  After a few moments Avery's expression changed to one of
astonishment, then, understanding.  Avery smiled with satisfaction.  His smile
slowly widened until his lips parted in silent, amused laughter.  His breathing
and heart slowed to a stop, his body went limp, his eyes closed.  Avery was
dead.

            The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone

  It was pleasant to Dr. Watson to find himself once more in the
untidy room of the first floor in Baker Street which had been the
starting-point of so many remarkable adventures. He looked
round him at the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred
bench of chemicals, the violin-case leaning in the corner, the
coal-scuttle, which contained of old the pipes and tobacco. Fi-
nally, his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of Billy,
the young but very wise and tactful page, who had helped a little
to fill up the gap of loneliness and isolation which surrounded
the saturnine figure of the great detective.
  "It all seems very unchanged, Billy. You don't change, ei-
ther. I hope the same can be said of him?"
  Billy glanced with some solicitude at the closed door of the
bedroom.
  "I think he's in bed and asleep," he said.
  It was seven in the evening of a lovely summer's day, but Dr.
Watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old
friend's hours to feel no surprise at the idea.
  "That means a case, I suppose?"
  "Yes, sir, he is very hard at it just now. I'm frightened for his
health. He gets paler and thinner, and he eats nothing. 'When
will you be pleased to dine, Mr. Holmes?' Mrs. Hudson asked.
'Seven-thirty, the day after to-morrow,' said he. You know his
way when he is keen on a case."
  "Yes, Billy, I know."
  "He's following someone. Yesterday he was out as a work-
man looking for a job. To-day he was an old woman. Fairly took
me in, he did, and I ought to know his ways by now." Billy
pointed with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned against
the sofa. "That's part of the old woman's outfit," he said.
  "But what is it all about, Billy?"
  Billy sank his voice, as one who discusses great secrets of
State. "I don't mind telling you, sir, but it should go no farther.
It's this case of the Crown diamond."
  "What -- the hundred-thousand-pound burglary?"
  "Yes, sir. They must get it back, sir. Why, we had the Prime
Minister and the Home Secretary both sitting on that very sofa.
Mr. Holmes was very nice to them. He soon put them at their
ease and promised he would do all he could. Then there is Lord
Cantlemere --"
  "Ah!"
  "Yes, sir, you know what that means. He's a stiff'un, sir, if I
may say so. I can get along with the Prime Minister, and I've
nothing against the Home Secretary, who seemed a civil, oblig-
ing sort of man, but I can't stand his Lordship. Neither can Mr.
Holmes, sir. You see, he don't believe in Mr. Holmes and he
was against employing him. He'd rather he failed."
  "And Mr. Holmes knows it?"
  "Mr. Holmes always knows whatever there is to know."
  "Well, we'll hope he won't fail and that Lord Cantlemere will
be confounded. But I say, Billy, what is that curtain for across
the window?"
  "Mr. Holmes had it put up there three days ago. We've got
something funny behind it."
  Billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the
alcove of the bow window.
  Dr. Watson could not restrain a cry of amazement. There was a
facsimile of his old friend, dressing-gown and all, the face
turned three-quarters towards the window and downward, as
though reading an invisible book, while the body was sunk deep
in an armchair. Billy detached the head and held it in the air.
  "We put it at different angles, so that it may seem more
lifelike. I wouldn't dare touch it if the blind were not down. But
when it's up you can see this from across the way."
  "We used something of the sort once before."
  "Before my time," said Billy. He drew the window curtains
apart and looked out into the street. "There are folk who watch
us from over yonder. I can see a fellow now at the window.
Have a look for yourself."
  Watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door
opened, and the long, thin form of Holmes emerged, his face pale
and drawn, but his step and bearing as active as ever. With a
single spring he was at the window, and had drawn the blind
once more.
  "That will do, Billy," said he. "You were in danger of your
life then, my boy, and I can't do without you just yet. Well,
Watson, it is good to see you in your old quarters once again.
You come at a critical moment."
  "So I gather."
  "You can go, Billy. That boy is a problem, Watson. How far
am I justified in allowing him to be in danger?"
  "Danger of what, Holmes?"
  "Of sudden death. I'm expecting something this evening."
  "Expecting what?"
  "To be murdered, Watson."
  "No, no, you are joking, Holmes!"
  "Even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke
than that. But we may be comfortable in the meantime, may we
not? Is alcohol permitted? The gasogene and cigars are in the old
place. Let me see you once more in the customary armchair.
You have not, I hope, learned to despise my pipe and my
lamentable tobacco? It has to take the place of food these days."
  "But why not eat?"
  "Because the faculties become refined when you starve them.
Why, surely, as a doctor, my dear Watson, you must admit that
what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much
lost to the brain. I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is a mere
appendix. Therefore, it is the brain I must consider."
  "But this danger, Holmes?"
  "Ah. yes, in case it should come off, it would perhaps be as
well that you should burden your memory with the name and
address of the murderer. You can give it to Scotland Yard, with
my love and a parting blessing. Sylvius is the name -- Count
Negretto Sylvius. Write it down, man, write it down! 136 Moorside
Gardens, N. W. Got it?"
  Watson's honest face was twitching with anxiety. He knew
only too well the immense risks taken by Holmes and was well
aware that what he said was more likely to be under-statement
than exaggeration. Watson was always the man of action, and he
rose to the occasion.
  "Count me in, Holmes. I have nothing to do for a day or
two."
  "Your morals don't improve, Watson. You have added fib-
bing to your other vices. You bear every sign of the busy
medical man, with calls on him every hour."
  "Not such important ones. But can't you have this fellow
arrested?"
  "Yes, Watson, I could. That's what worries him so."
  "But why don't you?"
  "Because I don't know where the diamond is."
  "Ah! Billy told me -- the missing Crown jewel!"
  "Yes, the great yellow Mazarin stone. I've cast my net and I
have my fish. But I have not got the stone. What is the use of
taking them? We can make the world a better place by laying
them by the heels. But that is not what I am out for. It's the
stone I want."
  "And is this Count Sylvius one of your fish?"
  "Yes, and he's a shark. He bites. The other is Sam Merton
the boxer. Not a bad fellow, Sam, but the Count has used him.
Sam's not a shark. He is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon.
But he is flopping about in my net all the same."
  "Where is this Count Sylvius?"
  "I've been at his very elbow all the morning. You've seen me
as an old lady, Watson. I was never more convincing. He
actually picked up my parasol for me once. 'By your leave,
madame,' said he -- half-ltalian, you know, and with the South-
ern graces of manner when in the mood, but a devil incarnate in
the other mood. Life is full of whimsical happenings, Watson."
  "It might have been tragedy."
  "Well, perhaps it might. I followed him to old Straubenzee's
workshop in the Minories. Straubenzee made the air-gun -- a very
pretty bit of work, as I understand, and I rather fancy it is in the
opposite window at the present moment. Have you seen the
dummy? Of course, Billy showed it to you. Well, it may get a
bullet through its beautiful head at any moment. Ah, Billy, what
is it?"
  The boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray.
Holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile.
  "The man himself. I had hardly expected this. Grasp the
nettle, Watson! A man of nerve. Possibly you have heard of his
reputation as a shooter of big game. It would indeed be a
triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me
to his bag. This is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind
his heel."
  "Send for the police."
  "I probably shall. But not just yet. Would you glance care-
fully out of the window, Watson, and see if anyone is hanging
about in the street?"
  Watson looked warily round the edge of the curtain.
  "Yes, there is one rough fellow near the door."
  "That will be Sam Merton -- the faithful but rather fatuous
Sam. Where is this gentleman, Billy?"
  "In the waiting-room, sir."
  "Show him up when I ring."
  "Yes,sir."
  "If I am not in the room, show him in all the same."
  "Yes, sir."
  Watson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned
earnestly to his companion.
  "Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible. This is a
desperate man, who sticks at nothing. He may have come to
murder you."
  "I should not be surprised."
  "I insist upon staying with you."
  "You would be horribly in the way."
  "In his way?"
  "No, my dear fellow -- in my way."
  "Well, I can't possibly leave you."
  "Yes, you can, Watson. And you will, for you have never failed
to play the game. I am sure you will play it to the end. This man
has come for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine."
  Holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines. "Take a
cab to Scotland Yard and give this to Youghal of the C. I. D.
Come back with the police. The fellow's arrest will follow."
  "I'll do that with joy.
  "Before you return I may have just time enough to find out
where the stone is." He touched the bell. "I think we will go out
through the bedroom. This second exit is exceedingly useful. I
rather want to see my shark without his seeing me, and I have,
as you will remember, my own way of doing it."
  It was, therefore, an empty room into which Billy, a minute
later, ushered Count Sylvius. The famous game-shot, sportsman,
and man-about-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a formida-
ble dark moustache shading a cruel, thin-lipped mouth, and
surmounted by a long, curved nose like the beak of an eagle. He
was well dressed, but his brilliant necktie, shining pin, and
glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect. As the door
closed behind him he looked round him with fierce, startled
eyes, like one who suspects a trap at every turn. Then he gave a
violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the
dressing-gown which projected above the armchair in the win-
dow. At first his expression was one of pure amazement. Then
the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes.
He took one more glance round to see that there were no
witnesses, and then, on tiptoe, his thick stick half raised, he
approached the silent figure. He was crouching for his final
spring and blow when a cool, sardonic voice greeted him from
the open bedroom door:
  "Don't break it, Count! Don't break it!"
  The assassin staggered back, amazement in his convulsed
face. For an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more, as
if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original; but
there was something in that steady gray eye and mocking smile
which caused his hand to sink to his side.
  "It's a pretty little thing," said Holmes, advancing towards
the image. "Tavernier, the French modeller, made it. He is as
good at waxworks as your friend Straubenzee is at air-guns."
  "Air-guns, sir! What do you mean?"
  "Put your hat and stick on the side-table. Thank you! Pray
take a seat. Would you care to put your revolver out also? Oh,
very good, if you prefer to sit upon it. Your visit is really most
opportune, for I wanted badly to have a few minutes' chat with
you. "
  The Count scowled, with heavy, threatening eyebrows.
  "I, too, wished to have some words with you, Holmes. That
is why I am here. I won't deny that I intended to assault you just
now."
  Holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table.
  "I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your
head," said he. "But why these personal attentions?"
  "Because you have gone out of your way to annoy me.
Because you have put your creatures upon my track."
  "My creatures! I assure you no!"
  "Nonsense! I have had them followed. Two can play at that
game, Holmes."
  "It is a small point, Count Sylvius, but perhaps you would
kindly give me my prefix when you address me. You can
understand that, with my routine of work, I should find myself
on familiar terms with half the rogues' gallery, and you will
agree that exceptions are invidious."
  "Well, Mr. Holmes, then."
  "Excellent! But I assure you you are mistaken about my
alleged agents."
  Count Sylvius laughed contemptuously.
  "Other people can observe as well as you. Yesterday there
was an old sporting man. To-day it was an elderly woman. They
held me in view all day."
  "Really, sir, you compliment me. Old Baron Dowson said the
night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had
gained the stage had lost. And now you give my little impersona-
tions your kindly praise?"
  "It was you -- you yourself?"
  Holmes shrugged his shoulders. "You can see in the corner
the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the Minories
before you began to suspect."
  "If I had known, you might never --"
  "Have seen this humble home again. I was well aware of it.
We all have neglected opportunities to deplore. As it happens,
you did not know, so here we are!"
  The Count's knotted brows gathered more heavily over his
menacing eyes. "What you say only makes the matter worse. It
was not your agents but your play-acting, busybody self! You
admit that you have dogged me. Why?"
  "Come now, Count. You used to shoot lions in Algeria."
  "Well?"
  "But why?"
  "Why? The sport -- the excitement -- the danger!"
  "And, no doubt, to free the country from a pest?"
  "Exactly!"
  "My reasons in a nutshell!"
  The Count sprang to his feet, and his hand involuntarily
moved back to his hip-pocket.              
  "Sit down, sir, sit down! There was another, more practical,
reason. I want that yellow diamond!"
  Count Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile.
  "Upon my word!" said he.
  "You knew that I was after you for that. The real reason why
you are here to-night is to find out how much I know about the
matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential. Well, I
should say that, from your point of view, it is absolutely essen-
tial, for I know all about it, save only one thing, which you are
about to tell me."
  "Oh, indeed! And pray, what is this missing fact?"
  "Where the Crown diamond now is."
  The Count looked sharply at his companion. "Oh, you want
to know that, do you? How the devil should I be able to lell you
where it is?"
  "You can, and you will."
  "Indeed!"
  "You can't bluff me, Count Sylvius." Holmes's eyes, as he
gazed at him, contracted and lightened until they were like two
menacing points of steel. "You are absolute plate-glass. I see to
the very back of your mind."
  "Then, of course, you see where the diamond is!" 
  Holmes clapped his hands with amusement, and then pointed a
derisive finger. "Then you do know. You have admitted it!"
  "I admit nothing."
  "Now, Count, if you will be reasonable we can do business.
If not, you will get hurt."
  Count Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling. "And you talk
about bluff!" said he.
  Holmes looked at him thoughtfully like a master chess-player
who meditates his crowning move. Then he threw open the table
drawer and drew out a squat notebook.
  "Do you know what I keep in this book?"
  "No, sir, I do not!"
  "You!"
  "Me!"                         
  "Yes, sir, you! You are all here -- every action of yor vile
and dangerous life."
  "Damn you, Holmes!" cried the Count with blazing eyes.
"There are limits to my patience!"
  "It's all here, Count. The real facts as to the death of old Mrs.
Harold, who left you the Blymer estate, which you so rapidly
gambled away."
  "You are dreaming!"
  "And the complete life history of Miss Minnie Warrender."
  "Tut! You will make nothing of that!"
  "Plenty more here, Count. Here is the robbery in the train
de-luxe to the Riviera on February 13, 1892. Here is the forged
check in the same year on the Credit Lyonnais."
  "No, you're wrong there."
  "Then I am right on the others! Now, Count, you are a
card-player. When the other fellow has all the trumps, it saves
time to throw down your hand."
  "What has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you
spoke?"
  "Gently, Count. Restrain that eager mind! Let me get to the
points in my own humdrum fashion. I have all this against you;
but, above all, I have a clear case against both you and your
fighting bully in the case of the Crown diamond."
  "Indeed!"
  "I have the cabman who took you to Whitehall and the
cabman who brought you away. I have the commissionaire who
saw you near the case. I have Ikey Sanders, who refused to cut it
up for you. Ikey has peached, and the game is up."
  The veins stood out on the Count's forehead. His dark, hairy
hands were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion. He
tried to speak, but the words would not shape themselves.
  "That's the hand I play from," said Holmes. "I put it all
upon the table. But one card is missing. It's the king of dia-
monds. I don't know where the stone is."
  "You never shall know."
  "No? Now, be reasonable, Count. Consider the situation. You
are going to be locked up for twenty years. So is Sam Merton.
What good are you going to get out of your diamond? None in
the world. But if you hand it over -- well, I'll compound a
felony. We don't want you or Sam. We want the stone. Give
that up, and so far as I am concerned you can go free so long as
you behave yourself in the future. If you make another slip
well, it will be the last. But this time my commission is to get
the stone, not you."
  "But if I refuse?"
  "Why, then -- alas! -- it must be you and not the stone."
  Billy had appeared in answer to a ring.
  "I think, Count, that it would be as well to have your friend
Sam at this conference. After all, his interests should be repre-
sented. Billy, you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside
the front door. Ask him to come up."
  "If he won't come, sir?"
  "No violence, Billy. Don't be rough with him. If you tell him
that Count Sylvius wants him he will certainly come."
  "What are you going to do now?" asked the Count as Billy
disappeared.
  "My friend Watson was with me just now. I told him that I
had a shark and a gudgeon in my net; now I am drawing the net
and up they come together."
  The Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind
his back. Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket
of his dressing-gown.
  "You won't die in your bed, Holmes."
  "I have often had the same idea. Does it matter very much?
Aher all, Count, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular
than horizontal. But these anticipations of the future are morbid.
Why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the
present?"
  A sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing
eyes of the master criminal. Holmes's figure seemed to grow
taller as he grew tense and ready.
  "It is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend," he
said in a quiet voice. "You know perfectly well that you dare
not use it, even if I gave you time to draw it. Nasty, noisy
things, revolvers, Count. Better stick to air-guns. Ah! I think I
hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner. Good day, Mr.
Merton. Rather dull in the street, is it not?"
  The prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid,
obstinate, slab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking
about him with a puzzled expression. Holmes's debonair manner
was a new experience, and though he vaguely felt that it was
hostile, he did not know how to counter it. He turned to his more
astute comrade for help.
  "What's the game now, Count? What's this fellow want?
What's up?" His voice was deep and raucous.
  The Count shrugged his shoulders, and it was Holmes who
answered.
  "If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr. Merton, I should say it was
all up."
  The boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate.
  "Is this cove trying to be funny, or what? I'm not in the funny
mood myself."
  "No, I expect not," said Holmes. "I think I can promise you
that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances.
Now, look here, Count Sylvius. I'm a busy man and I can't
waste time. I'm going into that bedroom. Pray make yourselves
quite at home in my absence. You can explain to your friend
how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence. I shall
try over the Hoffman 'Barcarole' upon my violin. In five min-
utes I shall return for your final answer. You quite grasp the
alternative, do you not? Shall we take you, or shall we have the
stone?"
  Holmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he
passed. A few moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of
that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door
of the bedroom.
  "What is it, then?" asked Merton anxiously as his companion
turned to him. "Does he know about the stone?"
  "He knows a damned sight too much about it. I'm not sure
that he doesn't know all about it."
  "Good Lord!" The boxer's sallow face turned a shade whiter.
  "Ikey Sanders has split on us."
  "He has, has he? I'll do him down a thick 'un for that if I
swing for it."
  "That won't help us much. We've got to make up our minds
what to do."
  "Half a mo'," said the boxer, looking suspiciously at the
bedroom door. "He's a leary cove that wants watching. I sup-
pose he's not listening?"
  "How can he be listening with that music going?"
  "That's right. Maybe somebody's behind a curtain. Too many
curtains in this room." As he looked round he suddenly saw for
the first time the effigy in the window, and stood staring and
pointing, too amazed for words.
  "Tut! it's only a dummy," said the Count.
  "A fake, is it? Well, strike me! Madame Tussaud ain't in it.
It's the living spit of him, gown and all. But them curtains
Count!"
  "Oh, confound the curtains! We are wasting our time, and
there is none too much. He can lag us over this stone."
  "The deuce he can!"
  "But he'll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is."
  "What! Give it up? Give up a hundred thousand quid?"
  "It's one or the other."
  Merton scratched his short-cropped pate.
  "He's alone in there. Let's do him in. If his light were out we
should have nothing to fear."
  The Count shook his head.
  "He is armed and ready. If we shot him we could hardly get
away in a place like this. Besides, it's likely enough that the
police know whatever evidence he has got. Hallo! What was
that?"
  There was a vague sound which seemed to come from the
window. Both men sprang round, but all was quiet. Save for the
one strange figure seated in the chair, the room was certainly
empty.
  "Something in the street," said Merton. "Now look here,
guv'nor, you've got the brains. Surely you can think a way out
of it. If slugging is no use then it's up to you."
  "I've fooled better men than he," the Count answered. "The
stone is here in my secret pocket. I take no chances leaving it
about. It can be out of England to-night and cut into four pieces
in Amsterdam before Sunday. He knows nothing of Van Seddar."
  "I thought Van Seddar was going next week."
  "He was. But now he must get off by the next boat. One or
other of us must slip round with the stone to Lime Street and tell
him."
  "But the false bottom ain't ready."
  "Well, he must take it as it is and chance it. There's not a
moment to lose." Again, with the sense of danger which be-
comes an instinct with the sportsman, he paused and looked hard
at the window. Yes, it was surely from the street that the faint
sound had come.
  "As to Holmes," he continued, "we can fool him easily
enough. You see, the damned fool won't arrest us if he can get
the stone. Well, we'll promise him the stone. We'll put him on
the wrong track about it, and before he finds that it is the wrong
track it will be in Holland and we out of the country."
  "That sounds good to me!" cried Sam Merton with a grin.
  "You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a move on him. I'll
see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession. I'll tell
him that the stone is in Liverpool. Confound that whining music;
it gets on my nerves! By the time he finds it isn't in Liverpool it
will be in quarters and we on the blue water. Come back here,
out of a line with that keyhole. Here is the stone."
  "I wonder you dare carry it."
  "Where could I have it safer? If we could take it out of
Whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings."
  "Let's have a look at it."
  Count Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his
associate and disregarded the unwashed hand which was ex-
tended towards him.
  "What -- d'ye think I'm going to snatch it off you? See here,
mister, I'm getting a bit tired of your ways."
  "Well, well, no offence, Sam. We can't afford to quarrel.
Come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly.
Now hold it to the light! Here!"
  "Thank you!"
  With a single spring Holmes had leaped from the dummy's
chair and had grasped the precious jewel. He held it now in one
hand, while his other pointed a revolver at the Count's head. The
two villains staggered back in utter amazement. Before they had
recovered Holmes had pressed the electric bell.
  "No violence, gentlemen -- no violence, I beg of you! Con-
sider the furniture! It must be very clear to you that your position
is an impossible one. The police are waiting below."
  The Count's bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear.
  "But how the deuce --?" he gasped.
  "Your surprise is very natural. You are not aware that a
second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain. I
fancied that you must have heard me when I displaced the figure,
but luck was on my side. It gave me a chance of listening to your
racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained
had you been aware of my presence."
  The Count gave a gesture of resignation.
  "We give you best, Holmes. I believe you are the devil
himself."
  "Not far from him, at any rate," Holmes answered with a
polite smile.
  Sam Merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated
the situation. Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the
stairs outside, he broke silence at last.
  "A fair cop!" said he. "But, I say, what about that bloomin'
fiddle! I hear it yet."
  "Tut, tut!" Holmes answered. "You are perfectly right. Let it
play! These modern gramophones are a remarkable invention."
  There was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the
criminals were led to the waiting cab. Watson lingered with
Holmes, congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his
laurels. Once more their conversation was interrupted by the
imperturbable Billy with his card-tray.
  "Lord Cantlemere sir."
  "Show him up, Biily. This is the eminent peer who represents
the very highest interests," said Holmes. "He is an excellent
and loyal person, but rather of the old regime. Shall we make
him unbend? Dare we venture upon a slight liberty? He knows,
we may conjecture, nothing of what has occurred."
  The door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet
face and drooping mid-Victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness
which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and fee-
ble gait. Holmes advanced affably, and shook an unresponsive
hand.
  "How do you do, Lord Cantlemere? It is chilly for the time of
year, but rather warm indoors. May I take your overcoat?"
  "No, I thank you; I will not take it off."
  Holmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve.
  "Pray allow me! My friend Dr. Watson would assure you that
these changes of temperature are most insidious."
  His Lordship shook himself free with some impatience.
  "I am quite comfortable, sir. I have no need to stay. I have
simply looked in to know how your self-appointed task was
progressing."
  "It is difficult -- very difficult."
  "I feared that you would find it so."
  There was a distinct sneer in the old courtier's words and
manner.
  "Every man finds his limitations, Mr. Holmes, but at least it
cures us of the weakness of self-satisfaction."
  "Yes, sir, I have been much perplexed."
  "No doubt."
  "Especially upon one point. Possibly you could help me upon
  "You apply for my advice rather late in the day. I thought that
you had your own all-sufficient methods. Still, I am ready to
help you."
  "You see, Lord Cantlemere, we can no doubt frame a case
against the actual thieves."
  "When you have caught them."
  "Exactly. But the question is -- how shall we proceed against
the receiver?"
  "Is this not rather premature?"
  "It is as well to have our plans ready. Now, what would you
regard as final evidence against the receiver?"
  "The actual possession of the stone."
  "You would arrest him upon that?"
  "Most undoubtedly."
  Holmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend
Watson could remember.
  "In that case, my dear sir, I shall be under the painful
necessity of advising your arrest."
  Lord Cantlemere was very angry. Some of the ancient fires
flickered up into his sallow cheeks.
  "You take a great liberty, Mr. Holmes. In fifty years of
official life I cannot recall such a case. I am a busy man, sir
engaged upon important affairs, and I have no time or taste for
foolish jokes. I may tell you frankly, sir, that I have never been a
believer in your powers, and that I have always been of the
opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular
police force. Your conduct confirms all my conclusions. I have
the honour, sir, to wish you good-evening."
  Holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the
peer and the door.
  "One moment, sir," said he. "To actually go off with the
Mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found
in temporary possession of it."
  "Sir, this is intolerable! Let me pass."
  "Put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat."
  "What do you mean, sir?"
  "Come -- come, do what I ask."
  An instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and
stammering, with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm.
  "What! What! How is this, Mr. Holmes?"
  "Too bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad!" cried Holmes. "My
old friend here will tell you that I have an impish habit of
practical joking. Also that I can never resist a dramatic situation.
I took the liberty -- the very great liberty, I admit -- of putting the
stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview."
  The old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before
him.
  "Sir, I am bewildered. But -- yes -- it is indeed the Mazarin
stone. We are greatly your debtors, Mr. Holmes. Your sense of
humour may, as you admit, be somewhat perverted, and its
exhibition remarkably untimely, but at least I withdraw any
reflection I have made upon your amazing professional powers.
But how --"
  "The case is but half finished; the details can wait. No doubt,
Lord Cantlemere, your pleasure in telling of this successful result
in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small
atonement for my practical joke. Billy, you will show his Lord-
ship out, and tell Mrs. Hudson that I should be glad if she would
send up dinner for two as soon as possible."

=========================================================================================
  A Relevant Excerpt from "The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of
               Death", by Daniel Manus Pinkwater.


  "Walter!  Come see what I've got!" said my father.

  What he had was an avocado.  Whenever he brings one home, which is fairly
often, he makes a big fuss about it.

  "Looky, Walter, an avocado!  What do you think of it?" My father is the only
person I know who says "looky!" He also says "lookit!"

  What I think of avocados is this:  On principle, I do not eat green, slimy
things, My mother doesn't eat them either.  She says she doesn't like the taste
of avocado.  That's good enough for me.  If there's any question at all about
the taste, I'm leaving those suckers alone.

  My father loves them.  Every time he brings one home, he acts like it's a
three-hundred-pound sailfish he's caught singlehanded, or an elk he brought
down with a bow and arrow.

  He's really enthusiastic about avocados.  He skins them and digs out that
oversized, stupid-looking pit, and then mashes up the slimy green part with a
fork.  Then he puts lemon juice and vinegar, salt and pepper, and powdered
garlic and paprika on it.  Of you have to go to all that trouble to disguise
the flavor, why bother, I say.

  Then he makes a speech about it.  "My goodness, this is one fine avocado," he
says.  "You have to know how to choose them.  You have to look for the ones
that are black and blasted looking.  The pretty green ones aren't fit to eat.
The funny thing is that they reduce the price of the really scrumptious ones
just because they're ugly.  I guess they want to sell them before they rot
completely."

  My father isn't a bad guy, in my opinion.  There are just a few subjects,
like avocados, on which he's irrational.

  My mother had found another tuna-casserole recipe.  This is something of a
hobby with her.  She's constantly finding these recipes in women's magazines.
She tries another one at least once a week.  They all taste like tuna fish.
Usually the have things in them you wouldn't expect to eat with tuna fish -
like grapes, hot- pickle slices, fried Chinese noodles.

  "I hope you will appreciate this, kiddo," my mother says, "seeing that your
mother took a healthy slice out of her finger whilst chopping up the
ingredients." She usually manages to injure herself at least once while
preparing a meal.  She has a Band-Aid on her finger.

  "Eat up, champ," she says.  "It's American." My mother has an idea that tuna
caught in Japanese waters is tainted with radioactivity, so she always shops
for brands canned within the continental United States.  Even Canadian brands
are out.  "They're too chummy with the Commonists," she says.  She calls
Communists "Commonists."

  If you were blind, or only knew my mother from talking with her on the
telephone, you'd probably think she was about six feet tall...and maybe two
hundred and fifty pounds in weight.  It's her voice, and the way she talks.
She sounds like she ought to be a big, slow- moving person, maybe a little
sloppy.  Actually, she's small and nervous, always well dressed, and a chain
smoker.  Once my father and I have started eating our meal, she brings a little
ashtray to the table and puffs a cigarette between bites of food.  This is far
more disgusting than avocado eating.  If I can possibly get out of it, I try
not to have meals with my parents.  I've complained to them about various
nauseating things they do, but it doesn't do any good.  "Everybody has a
family," my mother says.  I don't know what that means.

  Our apartment is new.  We are the first people ever to live in it.  When we
first moved into the building, it wasn't quite finished.  The whole place
smelled of paint, and there was brown paper on the floors in the elevator and
the hallways.  In those days, we had to take our shoes off outside the the
apartment door so we wouldn't track plaster dust onto the carpet.

  Come to think of it, I've never walked on the floor in our living room.
There are those clear plastic runners my mother put down, making a kind of path
through the living room to the dining alcove.  The furniture has plastic
covers, too.  My mother says that when you decorate with light colors, you have
to be careful.  Nobody ever sits in the living room, except when my parents
have company - and then it has to be company wearing suits and ties, and fancy
dresses.  When they expect company like that, my father puts on a suit and tie,
and my mother puts on a fancy dress and rolls up the plastic runners, and the
all sit in the living room.  I get called in to be introduced to the company.
I always stand at the edge of the living-room carpet.  The company says, "I
understand you're a fine young man," or, "He looks like a football player.  Are
you a football player?" I'm at least a foot too short to be a football player.
Besides which, I hate football.

  "Yes," I say, "I'm a football player." This happens -having company in the
living room - about twice a year.  The rest of the time, nobody sits there.

  When regular people - relatives and such - come over, everybody sits in the
den.  The den has a linoleum floor.  Sometimes my father sits around in his
undershirt.  When he's feeling funny, he gets Nosferatu, my parakeet, and gets
him to sit on his head.  Apparently, Nosferatu likes him.  He'll sit on my
father's head for an hour.

=========================================================================================

                             Mind War
                                by
                       William S. Burroughs

  Earlier I have suggested that the CIA, the Russians, and the 
Chinese have all set up top secret centers to study and apply 
psychic techniques to political ends.  Those of you who have read 
Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain will infer that the 
Russians are ahead of us.
  Now anyone who has lived for any time in countries like Morocco 
where magic is widely practiced has probably seen a curse work.  I 
have.  However, curses tend to be hit or miss, depending on the 
skill and power of the operator and the susceptibility of a 
victim.  And that isn't good enough for the CIA or any similar 
organization: `Bring us the ones that work not sometimes but every 
time.'  So what is the logical forward step?  To devise machines 
that can concentrate and direct psychic force with predictable 
effects.  I suggest that what the CIA is, or was working on, at 
their top secret Nevada installation may be described as 
computerized black magic.  If Curse A doesn't make it, Curse 
Program B automatically goes into operation -- and so on.
  I recommend to your attention a book called The Mind Masters by 
John Rossmann.  This is ostensibly a fanastic science fiction 
novel, interesting more for its content than its style, that may 
well contain some real inside information.  The story concerns a 
researcher who has been disillusioned by his work on Project 
Pandora, an American psychic training center run by a Colonel 
Pickett, who is stronly reminiscent of the mad General Ripper in 
Doctor Strangelove, right down to the cigar.  Only he is unloosing 
psychic warfare rather than nuclear more effective and more easily 
controlled for elitiest objectives.  The disillusioned researcher, 
one Britt St. Vincent, is contacted by Mero, a private institute 
dedicated to opposing these black magic centers.  (It should be 
obvious that only black magic has `military applications.')
  After he has been taken to Mero's secret hearquarters, Britt is 
briefed by Dr Webster on the purposes of Mero.  Dr. Webster cites 
an early report by columnist Jack Anderson that the reason the 
Johnson-Kosygin summit conference in 1967 at Glassboro, New 
Jersey, was held in such a remote spot was that this was the 
world's first summit conference on psychic warfare.  He recalls 
for Britt how the CIA, while making an electronic sweep of the 
U.S. Embassy in Moscow for listening devices, discovered some very 
unusual electromagnetic emanations pulsing through the building.  
(Later it came out that the Soviets had stepped up the power to a 
point where Embassy officials and their families were in danger 
from the high-voltage microwave radiation, which can cause 
confusion, migraines, and even death.)  Not long after, the CIA 
confirmed that this was in fact part of a much larger psychic 
attack on the Embassy.  When the Defense Department launched its 
top-secret psychic counter attack, according to columnist 
Anderson, it was code-named Project Pandora.
  Dr. Webster goes on to tell Britt: `Glassboro wasn't the end of 
it, Britt ... obviously.  By easily diverting funds within their 
mammoth defense budgets, small groups of supermilitarists here and 
in Russia covertly continued psychic programs...
  The violent student rioting of the late Sixties was largely 
instigated by electronic mood-control devices that were derived 
from the psychic discoveries of Project Pandora.  The riots, it is 
now evident, were the first phase of a massive plot.  The students 
were used by U.S. military extremists for two purposes.  First, 
the riots tended to discredit the student causes.  Secondly, the 
civil disturbances conveniently provided the plotters with the 
necessary reasons to reinstate some of their psychic weapons 
programs under the guise of `crowd control' research.  Britt 
learns that similar secret psychic research is still advancing 
rapidly in China, France, Israel, Egypt, South Africa, and Chile, 
in addition to the United States and Russia.
  `Although these scattered groups are currently working to beat 
each other to the secret of powers that will give them world 
control, there is a good possibility that they could even now join 
forces and make a combined psychic bid for world control - of 
succeeding if they joined forces.'
  And what would the future look like if such groups actually 
exist and if they do combine and take over?  An elitist world 
state very much along the lines laid down by the Nazis.  At the 
top wold be a theocracy trained in psychic control techniques 
implemented by computerized electronic devices that would render 
oppostion psychologically impossible.  Entry to this privileged 
class would be permitted only to those whose dedication to the 
world state was absolute and unquestioning.  In short, you don't 
get in by merit or ability but by being an all around one hundred 
percent shit.  Under this ruling, elite of power addicts would 
consist of an anonymous service collective of functionaries, 
managers, and bureaucrats.  And below them the slave workers.
  The troublesome artist would be eliminated or absorbed.  The 
elite lives happily ever after, at the top of a control state that 
makes 1984 seem cozy and nostalgic.

There is a theory which states  that  if  ever  anyone  discovers
exactly  what  the  Universe  is  for and why it is here, it will
instantly disappear  and  be  replaced  by  something  even  more
bizarre and inexplicable.
 
=================================================================
There is another  theory  which  states  that  this  has  already
happened.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 1
 
The story so far:
 
In the beginning the Universe was created.
 
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded
as a bad move.
 
Many races believe that it was  created  by  some  sort  of  God,
though  the  Jatravartid  people of Viltvodle VI believe that the
entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose  of  a  being
called the Great Green Arkleseizure.
 
The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear  of  the  time  they
call  The  Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue
creatures with more than  fifty  arms  each,  who  are  therefore
unique  in  being  the  only race in history to have invented the
aerosol deodorant before the wheel.
 
However, the  Great  Green  Arkleseizure  Theory  is  not  widely
accepted  outside  Viltvodle  VI  and  so, the Universe being the
puzzling place it is, other  explanations  are  constantly  being
sought.
 
For instance, a race of hyperintelligent  pan-dimensional  beings
once  built  themselves  a  gigantic  supercomputer  called  Deep
Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the  Ultimate
Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
 
For seven and a half million years,  Deep  Thought  computed  and
calculated,  and in the end announced that the answer was in fact
Forty-two - and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built
to find out what the actual question was.
 
And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large  that
it  was  frequently  mistaken  for  a  planet - especially by the
strange ape-like beings who roamed its surface,  totally  unaware
that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.
 
And this is very odd, because  without  that  fairly  simple  and
obvious  piece  of  knowledge,  nothing that ever happened on the
Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense.
 
Sadly however, just before the critical moment  of  readout,  the
Earth  was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way - so
they claimed - for a new hyperspace bypass, and so  all  hope  of
discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever.
 
Or so it would seem.
 
Two of there strange, ape-like creatures survived.
 
Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend
of  his,  Ford  Prefect,  suddenly  turned out to be from a small
planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he
had  hitherto  claimed;  and,  more  to the point, he knew how to
hitch rides on flying saucers.
 
Tricia McMillian - or Trillian  -  had  skipped  the  planet  six
months  earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the
Galaxy.
 
Two survivors.
 
They are  all  that  remains  of  the  greatest  experiment  ever
conducted - to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer
of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
 
And, less than half a million miles from where their starship  is
drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship
is moving slowly towards them.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 2
 
Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it  had  been  not  so  much
designed  as  congealed. The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices
which protuded from it at unsightly angles would have  disfigured
the  looks  of  most  ships,  but  in  this  case  that was sadly
impossible. Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not
by reliable witnesses.
 
In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship  you  would
have  to go inside and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however,
this is precisely what you will avoid doing because  the  average
Vogon  will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly
hideous to you that you will wish you had never been  born  -  or
(if  you  are  a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never
been born.
 
In fact, the average Vogon probably  wouldn't  even  think  once.
They are simple-minded, thick-willed, slug-brained creatures, and
thinking is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical
analysis  of  the  Vogon  reveals that its brain was originally a
badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver. The fairest  thing
you  can  say about them, then, is that they know what they like,
and  what  they  like  generally  involves  hurting  people  and,
wherever possible, getting very angry.
 
One  thing  they  don't  like  is  leaving  a  job  unfinished  -
particularly this Vogon, and particularly - for various reasons -
this job.
 
This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon  Jeltz  of  the  Galactic
Hyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of
demolishing the so-called "planet" Earth.
 
He heaved his monumentally vile body round  in  his  ill-fitting,
slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship
Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned.
 
It mattered little to him  that  the  Heart  of  Gold,  with  its
Infinite   Improbability   Drive,  was  the  most  beautiful  and
revolutionary ship ever built.  Aesthetics  and  technology  were
closed  books  to  him  and, had he had his way, burnt and buried
books as well.
 
It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox  was  aboard.
Zaphod  Beeblebrox  was  now  the ex-President of the Galaxy, and
though every police force in the Galaxy  was  currently  pursuing
both  him  and  this  ship  he  had  stolen,  the  Vogon  was not
interested.
 
He had other fish to fry.
 
It has been said that Vogons are not above a little  bribery  and
corruption  in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds,
and this was certainly true in his case. When he heard the  words
"integrity"  or "moral rectitude", he reached for his dictionary,
and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he
reached for the rule book and threw it away.
 
In seeking so implacably the destruction of  the  Earth  and  all
that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call
of his professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether
the  said  bypass  was actually going to be built, but the matter
had been glossed over.
 
He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction.
 
"Computer," he croaked, "get me my brain care specialist  on  the
line."
 
Within a few seconds the face of Gag  Halfrunt  appeared  on  the
screen,  smiling  the  smile  of  a man who knew he was ten light
years away from the Vogon  face  he  was  looking  at.  Mixed  up
somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too. Though the Vogon
persistently  referred  to  him  as  "my   private   brain   care
specialist"  there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it
was in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon. He  was  paying
him  an  awful lot of money to do some very dirty work. As one of
the Galaxy's most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he  and
a  consortium  of  his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an
awful lot of money when it  seemed  that  the  entire  future  of
psychiatry might be at stake.
 
"Well," he said, "hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and  how
are we feeling today?"
 
The Vogon captain told him that in the  last  few  hours  he  had
wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise.
 
Halfrunt's smile did not flicker for an instant.
 
"Well," he said, "I think this is perfectly normal behaviour  for
a  Vogon,  you  know?  The natural and healthy channelling of the
aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence."
 
"That," rumbled the Vogon, "is what you always say."
 
"Well again," said Halfrunt, "I  think  that  this  is  perfectly
normal  behaviour  for  a psychiatrist. Good. We are clearly both
very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today.  Now  tell  me,
what news of the mission?"
 
"We have located the ship."
 
"Wonderful," said Halfrunt, "wonderful! and the occupants?"
 
"The Earthman is there."
 
"Excellent! And ...?"
 
"A female from the same planet. They are the last."
 
"Good, good," beamed Halfrunt, "Who else?"
 
"The man Prefect."
 
"Yes?"
 
"And Zaphod Beeblebrox."
 
For an instant Halfrunt's smile flickered.
 
"Ah yes," he said,  "I  had  been  expecting  this.  It  is  most
regrettable."
 
"A personal friend?"  inquired  the  Vogon,  who  had  heard  the
expression somewhere once and decided to try it out.
 
"Ah, no," said Halfrunt, "in my profession you know,  we  do  not
make personal friends."
 
"Ah," grunted the Vogon, "professional detachment."
 
"No," said Halfrunt cheerfully, "we just don't have the knack."
 
He paused. His mouth continued to smile,  but  his  eyes  frowned
slightly.
 
"But Beeblebrox, you know," he  said,  "he  is  one  of  my  most
profitable clients. He had personality problems beyond the dreams
of analysts."
 
He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing
it.
 
"Still," he said, "you are ready for your task?"
 
"Yes."
 
"Good. Destroy the ship immediately."
 
"What about Beeblebrox?"
 
"Well," said Halfrunt brightly,  "Zaphod's  just  this  guy,  you
know?"
 
He vanished from the screen.
 
The Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button  which  connected
him with the remains of his crew.
 
"Attack," he said.
 
At that  precise  moment  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  was  in  his  cabin
swearing  very loudly. Two hours ago, he had said that they would
go for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe,
whereupon  he  had had a blazing row with the ship's computer and
stormed off to his cabin shouting that  he  would  work  out  the
Improbability factors with a pencil.
 
The Heart of Gold's Improbability Drive made it the most powerful
and  unpredictable  ship  in  existence.  There  was  nothing  it
couldn't do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that
the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen.
 
He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching
it.  He  didn't know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he
liked it.
 
He didn't know why he had become President of the Galaxy,  except
that it seemed a fun thing to be.
 
He did know that there were better reasons than these,  but  that
they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains.
He wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go
away  because  they  occasionally  surfaced  momentarily  and put
strange thoughts into the light, fun sections  of  his  mind  and
tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business
of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time.
 
At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time.  He  had
run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry.
 
"Starpox!" he shouted.
 
At that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in  mid  air.  This
was  not  because  of  anything  wrong with the ship's artificial
gravity field, but because he was  leaping  down  the  stair-well
which  led to the ship's personal cabins. It was a very high jump
to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled,  recovered,
raced  down  the  corridor  sending a couple of miniature service
robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod's door
and explained what was on his mind.
 
"Vogons," he said.
 
A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin
in  search  of  a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon
with a great deal of optimism., because he  knew  that  the  only
source  of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of
equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It  was
called  a  Nutri-Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered
it before.
 
It claimed  to  produce  the  widest  possible  range  of  drinks
personally  matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared
to use it. When put to the test, however, it invariably  produced
a  plastic  cup  filled  with  a  liquid that was almost, but nit
quite, entirely unlike tea.
 
He attempted to reason with the thing.
 
"Tea," he said.
 
"Share and Enjoy," the machine replied and provided him with  yet
another cup of the sickly liquid.
 
He threw it away.
 
"Share and enjoy," the machine repeated  and  provided  him  with
another one.
 
"Share and Enjoy" is the company motto of the  hugely  successful
Sirius  Cybernetics  Corporation  Complaints  division, which now
covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is
the  only  part  of  the  Corporation  to have shown a consistent
profit in recent years.
 
The motto  stands  -  or  rather  stood  -  in  three  mile  high
illuminated  letters  near the Complaints Department spaceport on
Eadrax. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly  after  it
was  erected,  the  ground  beneath the letters caved in and they
dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of  many
talented young complaints executives - now deceased.
 
The protruding upper halves of the letters  now  appear,  in  the
local language, to read "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no
longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.
 
Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid.
 
"Listen, you machine," he said, "you claim you can synthesize any
drink  in  existence,  so  why  do  you  keep  giving me the same
undrinkable stuff?"
 
"Nutrition and pleasurable  sense  data,"  burbled  the  machine.
"Share and Enjoy."
 
"It tastes filthy!"
 
"If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink," continued the
machine, "why not share it with your friends?"
 
"Because," said Arthur tartly, "I want to keep them. Will you try
to comprehend what I'm telling you? That drink ..."
 
"That  drink,"  said  the  machine  sweetly,  "was   individually
tailored  to  meet  your  personal requirements for nutrition and
pleasure."
 
"Ah," said Arthur, "so I'm a masochist on diet am I?"
 
"Share and Enjoy."
 
"Oh shut up."
 
"Will that be all?"
 
Arthur decided to give up.
 
"Yes," he said.
 
Then he decided he'd be dammed if he'd give up.
 
"No," he said, "look, it's very, very simple ... all I  want  ...
is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and
listen."
 
And he sat. He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about
China,  he  told  it  about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves
drying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots.  He  told  it
about  summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in
the milk before the tea so it wouldn't get scalded. He even  told
it (briefly) about the history of the East India Company.
 
"So that's it, is it?" said the Nutri-Matic when he had finished.
 
"Yes," said Arthur, "that is what I want."
 
"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?"
 
"Er, yes. With milk."
 
"Squirted out of a cow?"
 
"Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose ..."
 
"I'm going to need some help with this  one,"  said  the  machine
tersely.  All  the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice
and it now meant business.
 
"Well, anything I can do," said Arthur.
 
"You've done quite enough," the Nutri-Matic informed him.
 
It summoned up the ship's computer.
 
"Hi there!" said the ship's computer.
 
The Nutri-Matic explained about tea to the ship's  computer.  The
computer  boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri-Matic and
together they lapsed into a grim silence.
 
Arthur watched and  waited  for  a  while,  but  nothing  further
happened.
 
He thumped it, but still nothing happened.
 
Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge.
 
In the empty wastes of space,  the  Heart  of  Gold  hung  still.
Around  it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy. Towards it
crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 3
 
"Does anyone have a kettle?" Arthur asked as he walked on to  the
bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at
the computer to talk to her, Ford was thumping it and Zaphod  was
kicking  it,  and  also  why there was a nasty yellow lump on the
vision screen.
 
He put down the empty cup he was  carrying  and  walked  over  to
them.
 
"Hello?" he said.
 
At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the  polished  marble
surfaces  that  contained  the  instruments  that  controlled the
conventional photon drive. They materialized  beneath  his  hands
and  he  flipped over to manual control. He pushed, he pulled, he
pressed and he swore. The photon drive gave a sickly  judder  and
cut out again.
 
"Something up?" said Arthur.
 
"Hey, didja hear that?" muttered Zaphod as he leapt now  for  the
manual  controls of the Infinite Improbability Drive, "the monkey
spoke!"
 
The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then  also  cut
out.
 
"Pure history,  man,"  said  Zaphod,  kicking  the  Improbability
Drive, "a talking monkey!"
 
"If you're upset about something ..." said Arthur.
 
"Vogons!" snapped Ford, "we're under attack!"
 
Arthur gibbered.
 
"Well what are you doing? Let's get out of here!"
 
"Can't. Computer's jammed."
 
"Jammed?"
 
"It says all its circuits are occupied. There's no power anywhere
in the ship."
 
Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across
his forehead and slumped back against the wall.
 
"Nothing we can do," he said. He glared at nothing  and  bit  his
lip.
 
When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the  Earth  had
been demolished, he had used to play football. He had not been at
all good at it, and his particular speciality  had  been  scoring
own goals in important matches. Whenever this happened he used to
experience a peculiar tingling round the back of  his  neck  that
would  slowly  creep  up across his cheeks and heat his brow. The
image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering  boys  flinging
it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment.
 
A peculiar tingling  sensation  at  the  back  of  his  neck  was
creeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow.
 
He started to speak, and stopped.
 
He started to speak again and stopped again.
 
Finally he managed to speak.
 
"Er," he said. He cleared his throat.
 
"Tell me," he continued, and said it so nervously that the others
all  turned to stare at him. He glanced at the approaching yellow
blob on the vision screen.
 
"Tell me,"  he  said  again,  "did  the  computer  say  what  was
occupying it? I just ask out of interest ..."
 
Their eyes were riveted on him.
 
"And, er ... well that's it really, just asking."
 
Zaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck.
 
"What have you done to it, Monkeyman?" he breathed.
 
"Well," said Arthur, "nothing in fact. It's just that I  think  a
short while ago it was trying to work out how to ..."
 
"Yes?"
 
"Make me some tea."
 
"That's right guys," the computer sang out suddenly, "just coping
with  that  problem right now, and wow, it's a biggy. Be with you
in a while." It lapsed back into a silence that was only  matched
for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at
Arthur Dent.
 
As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons  chose  that  moment  to
start firing.
 
The ship shook, the  ship  thundered.  Outside,  the  inch  thick
force-shield  around  it  blistered,  crackled and spat under the
barrage of a dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon,  and
looked  as if it wouldn't be around for long. Four minutes is how
long Ford Prefect gave it."Three minutes and fifty  seconds,"  he
said a short while later.
 
"Forty-five seconds,"  he  added  at  the  appropriate  time.  He
flicked  idly  at  some  useless  switches,  then  gave Arthur an
unfriendly look.
 
"Dying for a cup of tea, eh?" he said. "Three minutes  and  forty
seconds."
 
"Will you stop counting!" snarled Zaphod.
 
"Yes," said Ford  Prefect,  "in  three  minutes  and  thirty-five
seconds."
 
Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled. He had
expected  a  chase,  he  had  expected  an  exciting grapple with
tractor beams, he had expected  to  have  to  use  the  specially
installed Sub-Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron to counter the Heart
of  Gold's  Infinite  Improbability  Drive,  but  the  Sub-Cyclic
Normality  Assert-i-Tron  lay  idle as the Heart of Gold just sat
there and took it.
 
A dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil  Photrazon  Cannon  continued  to
blaze  away at the Heart of Gold, and still it just sat there and
took it.
 
He tested every sensor at his disposal to see if  there  was  any
subtle trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found.
 
He didn't know about the tea of course.
 
Nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the  Heart  of  Gold
were  spending  the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life
they had left to spend.
 
Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at  the  idea  of  holding  a
seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on.
 
Obviously the subject of death  was  in  the  air,  but  more  as
something to be avoided than harped upon.
 
Possibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at  the  prospect  of
being  reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought
that they might just feel the same  way  about  him  and,  what's
more,  be  able  to  do  something about helping to postpone this
reunion.
 
Or again it might just have been one of  the  strange  promptings
that  occasionally  surfaced from that dark area of his mind that
he had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the
Galaxy.
 
"You want to talk to your great grandfather?" boggled Ford.
 
"Yeah."
 
"Does it have to be now?"
 
The ship continued to shake  and  thunder.  The  temperature  was
rising.  The  light  was  getting  dimmer  -  all  the energy the
computer didn't require for thinking about tea was  being  pumped
into the rapidly fading force-field.
 
"Yeah!" insisted Zaphod. "Listen Ford, I think he may be able  to
help us."
 
"Are you sure you mean think? Pick your words with care."
 
"Suggest something else we can do."
 
"Er, well ..."
 
"OK,  round  the  central  console.  Now.  Come   on!   Trillian,
Monkeyman, move."
 
They clustered round the central console in confusion,  sat  down
and,  feeling  exceptionally  foolish, held hands. With his third
hand Zaphod turned off the lights.
 
Darkness gripped the ship.
 
Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit-Kil cannon  continued
to rip at the force-field.
 
"Concentrate," hissed Zaphod, "on his name."
 
"What is it?" asked Arthur.
 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth."
 
"What?"
 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate!"
 
"The Fourth?"
 
"Yeah. Listen,  I'm  Zaphod  Beeblebrox,  my  father  was  Zaphod
Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third
..."
 
"What?"
 
"There was an accident with a contraceptive and a  time  machine.
Now concentrate!"
 
"Three minutes," said Ford Prefect.
 
"Why," said Arthur Dent, "are we doing this?"
 
"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox.
 
Trillian said nothing. What, she thought, was there to say?
 
The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a
far  corner  where  Marvin  the  Paranoid  Android  sat  slumped,
ignoring all  and  ignored  by  all,  in  a  private  and  rather
unpleasant world of his own.
 
Round  the  central  console  four  figures  hunched   in   tight
concentration  trying  to  blot  from  their minds the terrifying
shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that  echoed  through
it.
 
They concentrated.
 
Still they concentrated.
 
And still they concentrated.
 
The seconds ticked by.
 
On Zaphod's brow stood beads of sweat,  first  of  concentration,
then of frustration and finally of embarrassment.
 
At last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his  hands  from
Trillian and Ford and stabbed at the light switch.
 
"Ah, I was beginning to think you'd never turn  the  lights  on,"
said  a  voice.  "No,  not too bright please, my eyes aren't what
they once were."
 
Four figures jolted upright in their seats.  Slowly  they  turned
their  heads  to  look,  though  their  scalps  showed a distinct
propensity to try and stay in the same place.
 
"Now. Who disturbs me at this time?" said the small, bent,  gaunt
figure  standing  by  the  sprays  of  fern at the far end of the
bridge. His two small wispy-haired heads looked so  ancient  that
it  seemed  they  might  hold  dim  memories  of the birth of the
galaxies themselves. One lolled in sleep, but the other  squinted
sharply  at  them.  If his eyes weren't what they once were, they
must once have been diamond cutters.
 
Zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment. He  gave  the  intricate
little  double  nod which is the traditional Betelgeusian gesture
of familial respect.
 
"Oh ... er, hi Great Granddad ..." he breathed.
 
The little old  figure  moved  closer  towards  them.  He  peered
through  the  dim light. He thrust out a bony finger at his great
grandson.
 
"Ah," he snapped. "Zaphod Beeblebrox. The last of our great line.
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth."
 
"The First."
 
"The Nothingth," spat the figure.  Zaphod  hated  his  voice.  It
always  seemed  to  him  to  screech  like fingernails across the
blackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul.
 
He shifted awkwardly in his seat.
 
"Er, yeah," he muttered, "Er, look, I'm really  sorry  about  the
flowers,  I  meant to send them along, but you know, the shop was
fresh out of wreaths and ..."
 
"You forget!" snapped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.
 
"Well ..."
 
"Too busy. Never think of other people. The living  are  all  the
same."
 
"Two minutes, Zaphod," whispered Ford in an awed whisper.
 
Zaphod fidgeted nervously.
 
"Yeah, but I did mean to send them," he said. "And I'll write  to
my  great grandmother as well, just as soon as we get out of this
..."
 
"Your great  grandmother,"  mused  the  gaunt  little  figure  to
himself.
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "Er, how is she? Tell you what, I'll go  and
see her. But first we've just got to ..."
 
"Your late great grandmother and I are very well," rasped  Zaphod
Beeblebrox the Fourth.
 
"Ah. Oh."
 
"But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod ..."
 
"Yeah well ..." Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of
this  conversation,  and  Ford's heavy breathing at his side told
him that the seconds were ticking away fast. The  noise  and  the
shaking  had  reached terrifying proportions. He saw Trillian and
Arthur's faces white and unblinking in the gloom.
 
"Er, Great Grandfather ..."
 
"We've been following your progress with considerable despondency
..."
 
"Yeah, look, just at the moment you see ..."
 
"Not to say contempt!"
 
"Could you sort of listen for a moment ..."
 
"I mean what exactly are you doing with your life?"
 
"I'm being attacked by a Vogon fleet!" cried Zaphod.  It  was  an
exaggeration,  but  it was his only opportunity so far of getting
the basic point of the exercise across.
 
"Doesn't surprise me in the least," said the  little  old  figure
with a shrug.
 
"Only  it's  happening  right  now  you  see,"  insisted   Zaphod
feverishly.
 
The spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur  Dent  had
brought in and looked at it with interest.
 
"Er ... Great Granddad ..."
 
"Did you know," interrupting the ghostly  figure,  fixing  Zaphod
with  a  stern  look,  "that Betelgeuse Five has developed a very
slight eccentricy in its orbit?"
 
Zaphod didn't and found the information hard  to  concentrate  on
what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on.
 
"Er, no ... look," he said.
 
"Me spinning in my grave!" barked the ancestor.  He  slammed  the
cup  down  and pointed a quivering, stick-like see-through finger
at Zaphod.
 
"Your fault!" he screeched.
 
"One minute thirty," muttered Ford, his head in his hands.
 
"Yeah, look Great Granddad, can you actually help because ..."
 
"Help?" exclaimed the old man as if he'd been asked for a stoat.
 
"Yeah, help, and like, now, because otherwise ..."
 
"Help!" repeated the old man as if he'd been asked for a  lightly
grilled stoat in a bun with French fries. He stood amazed.
 
"You go swanning your way round the Galaxy  with  your  ..."  the
ancestor  waved  a  contemptuous  hand,  "with  your disreputable
friends, too busy to put flowers on my grave, plastic ones  would
have  done,  would  have been quite appropriate from you, but no.
Too busy. Too modern. Too sceptical  -  till  you  suddenly  find
yourself  in  a bit of a fix and come over suddenly all astrally-
minded!"
 
He shook his head - carefully, so as not to disturb  the  slumber
of the other one, which was already becoming restive.
 
"Well, I don't know, young Zaphod," he continued, "I  think  I'll
have to think about this one."
 
"One minute ten," said Ford hollowly.
 
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth peered at him curiously.
 
"Why does that man keep talking in numbers?" he said.
 
"Those numbers," said Zaphod tersely, "are  the  time  we've  got
left to live."
 
"Oh," said his great grandfather. He grunted to himself. "Doesn't
apply to me, of course," he said and moved off to a dimmer recess
of the bridge in search of something else to poke around at.
 
Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and  wondered
if he shouldn't just jump over and have done with it.
 
"Great Grandfather," he said, "It applies to  us!  We  are  still
alive, and we are about to lose our lives."
 
"Good job too."
 
"What?"
 
"What use is your life to anyone? When I  think  of  what  you've
made of it the phrase `pig's ear' comes irresistibly to my mind."
 
"But I was President of the Galaxy, man!"
 
"Huh," muttered his ancestor, "And what kind of a job is that for
a Beeblebrox?"
 
"Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!"
 
"Conceited little megapuppy."
 
Zaphod blinked in bewilderment.
 
"Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great Grandfather."
 
The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and
tapped  him sternly on the knee. This had the effect of reminding
Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he  didn't  feel  a
thing.
 
"You know and I know what being President  means,  young  Zaphod.
You  know because you've been it, and I know because I'm dead and
it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We  have
a saying up here. `Life is wasted on the living.'"
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod bitterly, "very good. Very deep. Right now  I
need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads."
 
"Fifty seconds," grunted Ford Prefect.
 
"Where was I?" said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.
 
"Pontificating," said Zaphod Beeblebrox.
 
"Oh yes."
 
"Can this guy," muttered Ford quietly  to  Zaphod,  "actually  in
fact help us?"
 
"Nobody else can," whispered Zaphod.
 
Ford nodded despondently.
 
"Zaphod!" the ghost was saying,  "you  became  President  of  the
Galaxy for a reason. Have you forgotten?"
 
"Could we go into this later?"
 
"Have you forgotten!" insisted the ghost.
 
"Yeah! Of course I forgot! I had  to  forget.  They  screen  your
brain when you get the job you know. If they'd found my head full
of tricksy ideas I'd have been right out  on  the  streets  again
with  nothing  but  a  fat pension, secretarial staff, a fleet of
ships and a couple of slit throats."
 
"Ah," nodded the ghost in satisfaction, "then you do remember!"
 
He paused for a moment.
 
"Good," he said and the noise stopped.
 
"Forty-eight seconds," said Ford. He looked again  at  his  watch
and tapped it. He looked up.
 
"Hey, the noise has stopped," he said.
 
A mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost's hard little eyes.
 
"I've slowed down time for a moment," he said, "just for a moment
you understand. I would hate you to miss all I have to say."
 
"No, you listen to me, you  see-through  old  bat,"  said  Zaphod
leaping  out  of his chair, "A - thanks for stopping time and all
that, great, terrific, wonderful, but  B  -  no  thanks  for  the
homily, right? I don't know what this great think I'm meant to be
doing is, and it looks to me as if I was supposed  not  to  know.
And I resent that, right?
 
"The old me knew. The old me cared. Fine, so far so hoopy. Except
that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own
brain - my own brain - and locked off  the  bits  that  knew  and
cared, because if I knew and cared I wouldn't be able to do it. I
wouldn't be able to go and be President, and I wouldn't  be  able
to steal this ship, which must be the important thing.
 
"But this former self of mine killed himself off, didn't  he,  by
changing  my  brain? OK, that was his choice. This new me has its
own choices to make, and by a strange coincidence  those  choices
involve  not  knowing  and  not  caring  about  this  big number,
whatever it is. That's what he wanted, that's what he got.
 
"Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in  control,
leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off. Well,
I don't want to know, and I don't want to hear  them.  That's  my
choice. I'm not going to be anybody's puppet, particularly not my
own."
 
Zaphod banged the console in fury, oblivious  to  the  dumbfolded
looks he was attracting.
 
"The old me  is  dead!"  he  raved,  "Killed  himself!  The  dead
shouldn't hang about trying to interfere with the living!"
 
"And yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape," said  the
ghost.
 
"Ah," said Zaphod, sitting down  again,  "well  that's  different
isn't it?"
 
He grinned at Trillian, weakly.
 
"Zaphod," rasped the apparition, "I think the only reason I waste
my  breath  on  you is that being dead I don't have any other use
for it."
 
"OK," said Zaphod, "why don't you tell me what the big secret is.
Try me."
 
"Zaphod, you knew when you were President of the Galaxy,  as  did
Yooden Vranx before you, that the President is nothing. A cipher.
Somewhere in the shadows behind is another man, being, something,
with  ultimate  power. That man, or being, or something, you must
find - the man who controls this  Galaxy,  and  -  we  suspect  -
others. Possibly the entire Universe."
 
"Why?"
 
"Why?" exclaimed an astonished ghost, "Why? Look around you  lad,
does it look to you as if it's in very good hands?"
 
"It's alright."
 
The old ghost glowered at him.
 
"I will not argue with you. You will simply take this ship,  this
Improbability  Drive  ship to where it is needed. You will do it.
Don't think you can escape your purpose. The Improbability  Field
controls you, you are in its grip. What's this?"
 
He was standing tapping at one of  the  terminals  of  Eddie  the
Shipboard Computer. Zaphod told him.
 
"What's it doing?"
 
"It is trying," said Zaphod with wonderful  restraint,  "to  make
tea."
 
"Good," said his great  grandfather,  "I  approve  of  that.  Now
Zaphod,  "he  said, turning and wagging a finger at him, "I don't
know if you are really capable of succeeding in your job. I think
you will not be able to avoid it. However, I am too long dead and
too tired to care as much as I did. The  principal  reason  I  am
helping  you  now  is that I couldn't bear the thought of you and
your modern friends slouching about up here. Understood?"
 
"Yeah, thanks a bundle."
 
"Oh, and Zaphod?"
 
"Er, yeah?"
 
"If you ever find you need help again, you  know,  if  you're  in
trouble, need a hand out of a tight corner ..."
 
"Yeah?"
 
"Please don't hesitate to get lost."
 
Within the space of one second, a bolt of light flashed from  the
wizened  old  ghost's  hands to the computer, the ghost vanished,
the bridge filled with billowing smoke  and  the  Heart  of  Gold
leapt  an  unknown  distance  through  the dimensions of time and
space.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 4
 
Ten light years away, Gag Halfrunt jacked up his smile by several
notches.  As he watched the picture on his vision screen, relayed
across the sub-ether from the bridge of the Vogon  ship,  he  saw
the final shreds of the Heart of Gold's force-shield ripped away,
and the ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke.
 
Good, he thought.
 
The end of the last stray survivors  of  the  demolition  he  had
ordered on the planet Earth, he thought.
 
The final end of this dangerous (to the  psychiatric  profession)
and subversive (also to the psychiatric profession) experiment to
find the Question to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe,
and Everything, he thought.
 
There would be some celebration with his fellows tonight, and  in
the  morning  they would meet again their unhappy, bewildered and
highly profitable patients, secure  in  the  knowledge  that  the
Meaning  of  Life  would  not  now be, once and for all, well and
truly sorted out, he thought.
 
"Family's always embarrassing isn't it?" said Ford to  Zaphod  as
the smoke began to clear.
 
He paused, then looked about.
 
"Where's Zaphod?" he said.
 
Arthur and Trillian looked about  blankly.  They  were  pale  and
shaken and didn't know where Zaphod was.
 
"Marvin?" said Ford, "Where's Zaphod?"
 
A moment later he said:
 
"Where's Marvin?"
 
The robot's corner was empty.
 
The ship was  utterly  silent.  It  lay  in  thick  black  space.
Occasionally  it  rocked  and  swayed. Every instrument was dead,
every vision screen was dead. They  consulted  the  computer.  It
said:
 
"I  regret  that  I  have  been   temporarily   closed   to   all
communication. Meanwhile, here is some light music."
 
They turned off the light music.
 
They searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment
and  alarm. Everywhere was dead and silent. Nowhere was there any
trace of Zaphod or of Marvin.
 
One of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the
Nutri-Matic machine was located.
 
On the delivery plate of the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer was  a
small  tray,  on  which  sat three bone china cups and saucers, a
bone china jug of milk, a silver teapot  full  of  the  best  tea
Arthur had ever tasted, and a small printed note saying "Wait".
 
=================================================================
Chapter 5
 
Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in
the known Universe.
 
Although it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny  and  more
full  of  wonderfully  exciting  people  than a pomegranate is of
pips, it can hardly be insignificant that when a  recent  edition
of  Playbeing  magazine headlined an article with the words "When
you are tired of Ursa Minor Beta you  are  tired  of  life",  the
suicide rate quadrupled overnight.
 
Not that there are any nights on Ursa Minor Beta.
 
It is a West Zone planet which by an  inexplicable  and  somewhat
suspicious  freak  of topography consists almost entirely of sub-
tropical coastline. By an equally suspicious  freak  of  temporal
relastatics,  it  is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before
the beach bars close.
 
No adequate explanation for this has been  forthcoming  from  the
dominant  lifeforms  on  Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their
time attempting to achieve  spiritual  enlightenment  by  running
round  swimming  pools, and inviting Investigation Officials form
the Galactic Geo-Temporal Control Board to "have a  nice  diurnal
anomaly".
 
There is only one city on Ursa  Minor  Beta,  and  that  is  only
called  a city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on
the ground there than elsewhere.
 
If you approach Light City by air - and there is no other way  of
approaching  it,  no roads, no port facilities - if you don't fly
they don't want to see you in Light City - you will  see  why  it
has  this  name. Here the sun shines brightest of all, glittering
on the  swimming  pools,  shimmering  on  the  white,  palm-lined
boulevards,  glistening  on  the healthy bronzed specks moving up
and down them, gleaming off the villas,  the  hazy  airpads,  the
beach bars and so on.
 
Most particularly it shines  on  a  building,  a  tall  beautiful
building  consisting  of two thirty-storey white towers connected
by a bridge half-way up their length.
 
The building is the home of a book, and was  built  here  on  the
proceeds  of  an  extraordinary copyright law suit fought between
the book's editors and a breakfast cereal company.
 
The book is a guide book, a travel book.
 
It is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most  successful,
books  ever  to  come out of the great publishing corporations of
Ursa Minor - more popular than Life Begins at  Five  Hundred  and
Fifty,  better selling than The Big Bang Theory - A Personal View
by Eccentrica Gallumbits (the triple breasted whore  of  Eroticon
Six)   and  more  controversial  than  Oolon  Colluphid's  latest
blockbusting title Everything You Never Wanted To Know About  Sex
But Have Been Forced To Find Out.
 
(And in many of the  more  relaxed  civilizations  on  the  Outer
Eastern  Rim  of  the  Galaxy,  it  has long surplanted the great
Encyclopaedia  Galactica  as  the  standard  repository  of   all
knowledge  and  wisdom,  for  though  it  has  many omissions and
contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly  inaccurate,
it  scores  over  the  older  and  more  pedestrian  work  in two
important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper,  and  secondly
it has the words Don't Panic printed in large friendly letters on
its cover.)
 
It is of course that invaluable companion for all those who  want
to  see  the  marvels  of the known Universe for less than thirty
Altairan Dollars a day - The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
 
If you stood with your back to the main  entrance  lobby  of  the
Guide  offices  (assuming  you had landed by now and freshened up
with a quick dip and shower) and then walked east, you would pass
along  the  leafy  shade of Life Boulevard, be amazed by the pale
golden colour of  the  beaches  stretching  away  to  your  left,
astounded  by the mind-surfers floating carelessly along two feet
above the waves as if  it  was  nothing  special,  surprised  and
eventually  slightly  irritated  by the giant palm trees that hum
toneless nothings throughout the daylight hours, in  other  words
continuously.
 
If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you  would  enter
the  Lalamatine  district  of  shops,  bolonut trees and pavement
cafes where the UM-Betans come to relax after a hard  afternoon's
relaxation  on the beach. The Lalamatine district is one of those
very few areas which doesn't enjoy a perpetual Saturday afternoon
-  it  enjoys  instead  the  cool  of  a perpetual early Saturday
evening. Behind it lie the night clubs.
 
If, on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of  eveningtime  -
call  it  what  you will - you had approached the second pavement
cafe on the right you would have seen  the  usual  crowd  of  UM-
Betans  chatting,  drinking,  looking  very relaxed, and casually
glancing at each other's watches to see how expensive they were.
 
You would also have seen a couple of rather  dishevelled  looking
hitch-hikers  from  Algol who had recently arrived on an Arcturan
Megafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it  for  a  few
days.  They  were  angry  and  bewildered  to discover that here,
within sight of the Hitch Hiker's Guide building itself, a simple
glass  of  fruit juice cost the equivalent of over sixty Altairan
dollars.
 
"Sell out," one of them said, bitterly.
 
If at that moment you had then looked at the next table  but  one
you  would  have  seen Zaphod Beeblebrox sitting and looking very
startled and confused.
 
The reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had
been sitting on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold.
 
"Absolute sell out," said the voice again.
 
Zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two
dishevelled  hitch-hikers  at  the next table. Where the hell was
he? How had he got there? Where was his ship? His hand  felt  the
arm  of  the chair on which he was sitting, and then the table in
front of him. They seemed solid enough. He sat very still.
 
"How can they sit and write a guide for hitch-hikers in  a  place
like this?" continued the voice. "I mean look at it. Look at it!"
 
Zaphod was looking at it. Nice place, he thought. But where?  And
why?
 
He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses.  In  the
same  pocket  he  felt  a  hard smooth, unidentified lump of very
heavy metal. He pulled it out and looked at it. He blinked at  it
in  surprise. Where had he got that? He returned it to his pocket
and put on the sunglasses, annoyed to  discover  that  the  metal
object  had  scratched  one  of the lenses. Nevertheless, he felt
much more comfortable with them on. They were a  double  pair  of
Joo  Janta  200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which
had been specially designed to  help  people  develop  a  relaxed
attitude  to  danger.  At  the  first  hint  of trouble they turn
totally black and thus prevent  you  from  seeing  anything  that
might alarm you.
 
Apart from the scratch the lenses were  clear.  He  relaxed,  but
only a little bit.
 
The angry hitch-hiker  continued  to  glare  at  his  monstrously
expensive fruit juice.
 
"Worst thing that ever happened to  the  Guide,  moving  to  Ursa
Minor  Beta," he grumbled, "they've all gone soft. You know, I've
even   heard  that   they've  created  a   whole   electronically
synthesized  Universe  in one of their offices so they can go and
research stories during the day and still go to  parties  in  the
evening. Not that day and evening mean much in this place."
 
Ursa Minor Beta, thought Zaphod. At least he knew  where  he  was
now.  He assumed that this must be his great grandfather's doing,
but why?
 
Much to his annoyance, a thought popped into  his  mind.  It  was
very  clear  and  very distinct, and he had now come to recognize
these thoughts for what they were. His  instinct  was  to  resist
them.  They  were  the  pre-ordained promptings from the dark and
locked off parts of his mind.
 
He sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him.
He ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him.
He gave in to it.
 
What the hell, he thought, go with the flow. He  was  too  tired,
confused  and  hungry  to  resist.  He  didn't even know what the
thought meant.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 6
 
"Hello? Yes? Megadodo Publications, home  of  the  Hitch  Hiker's
Guide  to  the  Galaxy,  the  most totally remarkable book in the
whole of the known Universe, can I  help  you?"  said  the  large
pink-winged  insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along
the vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the
Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices. It fluttered its wings
and  rolled  its  eyes.  It  glared  at  all  the  grubby  people
cluttering  up  the  foyer, soiling the carpets and leaving dirty
handmarks on the upholstery. It  adored  working  for  the  Hitch
Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of
keeping all the hitch-hikers  away.  Weren't  they  meant  to  be
hanging  round dirty spaceports or something? It was certain that
it had read something somewhere in the book about the  importance
of  hanging  round  dirty  spaceports. Unfortunately most of them
seemed to come and hang around in this  nice  clean  shiny  foyer
after  hanging around in extremely dirty spaceports. And all they
ever did was complain. It shivered its wings.
 
"What?" it said into the phone. "Yes, I passed on your message to
Mr  Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now.
He's on an intergalactic cruise."
 
It waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who  was
angrily  trying  to  engage  its attention. The petulant tentacle
directed the angry person to look at the notice on  the  wall  to
its left and not to interrupt an important phone call.
 
"Yes," said the insect, "he is in his  office,  but  he's  on  an
intergalactic  cruise. Thank you so much for calling." It slammed
down the phone.
 
"Read the notice," it said to the angry man  who  was  trying  to
complain  about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of
misinformation contained in the book.
 
The Hitch  Hiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy  is  an  indispensable
companion  to  all those who are keen to make sense of life in an
infinitely complex and confusing Universe, for though  it  cannot
hope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does at least
make the reassuring claim, that where it is inaccurate it  is  at
least  definitely  inaccurate. In cases of major discrepancy it's
always reality that's got it wrong.
 
This  was  the  gist  of  the  notice.  It  said  "The  Guide  is
definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate."
 
This has led to some interesting consequences. For instance, when
the  Editors  of the Guide were sued by the families of those who
had died as a result of taking the  entry  on  the  planet  Traal
literally  (it said "Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very
good meal for visiting tourists" instead of "Ravenous  Bugblatter
beasts  often  make  a very good meal of visiting tourists") they
claimed that the first version  of  the  sentence  was  the  more
aesthetically  pleasing,  summoned  a  qualified  poet to testify
under oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty and hoped  thereby
to  prove that the guilty party was Life itself for failing to be
either beautiful or true. The judges concurred, and in  a  moving
speech  held  that Life itself was in contempt of court, and duly
confiscated it from all those there present before going  off  to
enjoy a pleasant evening's ultragolf.
 
Zaphod Beeblebrox entered the foyer. He strode up to  the  insect
receptionist.
 
"OK," he said, "Where's Zarniwoop? Get me Zarniwoop."
 
"Excuse me, sir?" said the insect icily. It did not  care  to  be
addressed in this manner.
 
"Zarniwoop. Get him, right? Get him now."
 
"Well, sir," snapped the fragile little creature, "if  you  could
be a little cool about it ..."
 
"Look," said Zaphod, "I'm up  to  here  with  cool,  OK?  I'm  so
amazingly  cool  you  could  keep  a side of meat inside me for a
month. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my  pelvis.  Now
will you move before you blow it?"
 
"Well, if you'd let me explain, sir," said the insect tapping the
most  petulant  of all the tentacles at its disposal, "I'm afraid
that  isn't  possible  right  now  as  Mr  Zarniwoop  is  on   an
intergalactic cruise."
 
Hell, thought Zaphod.
 
"When he's going to be back?" he said.
 
"Back sir? He's in his office."
 
Zaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought  out
in his mind. He didn't succeed.
 
"This cat's on an intergalactic cruise ...  in  his  office?"  He
leaned forward and gripped the tapping tentacle.
 
"Listen, three eyes," he said, "don't you try to outweird  me.  I
get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal."
 
"Well, just who do you think you are, honey?" flounced the insect
quivering its wings in rage, "Zaphod Beeblebrox or something?"
 
"Count the heads," said Zaphod in a low rasp.
 
The insect blinked at him. It blinked at him again.
 
"You are Zaphod Beeblebrox?" it squeaked.
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "but don't shout it out or they'll all  want
one."
 
"The Zaphod Beeblebrox?"
 
"No, just a Zaphod Beeblebrox, didn't you  hear  I  come  in  six
packs?"
 
The insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation.
 
"But sir," it squealed, "I just  heard  on  the  sub-ether  radio
report. It said that you were dead ..."
 
"Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod, "I just haven't stopped moving
yet. Now. Where do I find Zarniwoop?"
 
"Well, sir, his office is on the fifteenth floor, but ..."
 
"But he's on an intergalactic cruise, yeah, yeah, how do I get to
him."
 
"The newly  installed  Sirius  Cybernetics  Corporation  Vertical
People Transporters are in the far corner sir. But sir ..."
 
Zaphod was turning to go. He turned back.
 
"Yeah?" he said.
 
"Can I ask you why you want to see Mr Zarniwoop?"
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, who was unclear on this  point  himself,  "I
told myself I had to."
 
"Come again sir?"
 
Zaphod leaned forward, conspirationally.
 
"I just materialized out of thin air in one of  your  cafes,"  he
said,  "as  a  result  of  an argument with the ghost of my great
grandfather. No sooner had I got there that my former  self,  the
one  that  operated on my brain, popped into my head and said `Go
see Zarniwoop'. I have never heard of the  cat.  That  is  all  I
know.  That  and the fact that I've got to find the man who rules
the Universe."
 
He winked.
 
"Mr Beeblebrox, sir," said the insect in awed wonder, "you're  so
weird you should be in movies."
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink  wing,
"and you, baby, should be in real life."
 
The insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation  and
then reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone.
 
A metal hand restrained it.
 
"Excuse me," said the owner of the metal hand  in  a  voice  that
would  have  made  an  insect  of  a more sentimental disposition
collapse in tears.
 
This was not such an insect, and it couldn't stand robots.
 
"Yes, sir," it snapped, "can I help you?"
 
"I doubt it," said Marvin.
 
"Well in that case, if you'll just excuse  me  ..."  Six  of  the
phones  were  now  ringing. A million things awaited the insect's
attention.
 
"No one can help me," intoned Marvin.
 
"Yes, sir, well ..."
 
"Not that anyone tried of course."  The  restraining  metal  hand
fell  limply  by  Marvin's  side.  His  head  hung  forward  very
slightly.
 
"Is that so," said the insect tartly.
 
"Hardly worth anyone's while to help a menial robot is it?"
 
"I'm sorry, sir, if ..."
 
"I mean where's the percentage in being  kind  or  helpful  to  a
robot if it doesn't have any gratitude circuits?"
 
"And you don't have any?" said the insect, who didn't seem to  be
able to drag itself out of this conversation.
 
"I've never had occasion to find out," Marvin informed it.
 
"Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal ..."
 
"Aren't you going to ask me what I want?"
 
The insect paused. Its long thin tongue darted out and licked its
eyes and darted back again.
 
"Is it worth it?" it asked.
 
"Is anything?" said Marvin immediately.
 
"What ... do ... you ... want?"
 
"I'm looking for someone."
 
"Who?" hissed the insect.
 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox," said Marvin, "he's over there."
 
The insect shook with rage. It could hardly speak.
 
"Then why did you ask me?" it screamed.
 
"I just wanted something to talk to," said Marvin.
 
"What!"
 
"Pathetic isn't it?"
 
With a grinding of gears  Marvin  turned  and  trundled  off.  He
caught  up  with  Zaphod  approaching  the elevators. Zaphod span
round in astonishment.
 
"Hey ... Marvin!" he said, "Marvin! How did you get here?"
 
Marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him.
 
"I don't know," he said.
 
"But ..."
 
"One moment I was sitting in your ship  feeling  very  depressed,
and   the  next  moment  I  was  standing  here  feeling  utterly
miserable. An Improbability Field I expect."
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "I expect  my  great  grandfather  sent  you
along to keep me company."
 
"Thanks a bundle grandad," he added to himself under his breath.
 
"So, how are you?" he said aloud.
 
"Oh, fine," said Marvin, "if you happen to like  being  me  which
personally I don't."
 
"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod as the elevator doors opened.
 
"Hello," said the elevator sweetly, "I am to be your elevator for
this  trip  to  the floor of your choice. I have been designed by
the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation to take you,  the  visitor  to
the  Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, into these their offices.
If you enjoy your ride, which will be swift and pleasurable, then
you may care to experience some of the other elevators which have
recently been installed  in  the  offices  of  the  Galactic  tax
department,  Boobiloo  Baby  Foods  and  the  Sirian State Mental
Hospital, where many ex-Sirius Cybernetics Corporation executives
will  be  delighted  to  welcome your visits, sympathy, and happy
tales of the outside world."
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, stepping into  it,  "what  else  do  you  do
besides talk?"
 
"I go up," said the elevator, "or down."
 
"Good," said Zaphod, "We're going up."
 
"Or down," the elevator reminded him.
 
"Yeah, OK, up please."
 
There was a moment of silence.
 
"Down's very nice," suggested the elevator hopefully.
 
"Oh yeah?"
 
"Super."
 
"Good," said Zaphod, "Now will you take us up?"
 
"May I ask you," inquired the  elevator  in  its  sweetest,  most
reasonable  voice,  "if  you've  considered all the possibilities
that down might offer you?"
 
Zaphod knocked one of his  heads  against  the  inside  wall.  He
didn't  need  this,  he thought to himself, this of all things he
had no need of. He hadn't asked to be here. If he  was  asked  at
this moment where he would like to be he would probably have said
he would like to be lying  on  the  beach  with  at  least  fifty
beautiful  women and a small team of experts working out new ways
they could be nice to him, which was his usual reply. To this  he
would  probably have added something passionate on the subject of
food.
 
One thing he didn't want to be doing was chasing  after  the  man
who  ruled  the Universe, who was only doing a job which he might
as well keep at, because if  it  wasn't  him  it  would  only  be
someone  else.  Most  of  all he didn't want to be standing in an
office block arguing with an elevator.
 
"Like what other possibilities?" he asked wearily.
 
"Well," the voice trickled on like honey  on  biscuits,  "there's
the basement, the microfiles, the heating system ... er ..."
 
It paused.
 
"Nothing particularly  exciting,"  it  admitted,  "but  they  are
alternatives."
 
"Holy Zarquon," muttered Zaphod, "did I ask for an existentialist
elevator?" he beat his fists against the wall.
 
"What's the matter with the thing?" he spat.
 
"It doesn't want to go up," said Marvin  simply,  "I  think  it's
afraid."
 
"Afraid?" cried Zaphod, "Of what?  Heights?  An  elevator  that's
afraid of heights?"
 
"No," said the elevator miserably, "of the future ..."
 
"The future?" exclaimed Zaphod, "What  does  the  wretched  thing
want, a pension scheme?"
 
At that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind
them.  From  the  walls  around  them  came the sound of suddenly
active machinery.
 
"We can all see into the future," whispered the elevator in  what
sounded like terror, "it's part of our programming."
 
Zaphod looked out  of  the  elevator  -  an  agitated  crowd  had
gathered round the elevator area, pointing and shouting.
 
Every elevator in the building was coming down, very fast.
 
He ducked back in.
 
"Marvin," he said, "just get this elevator go up will you?  We've
got to get to Zarniwoop."
 
"Why?" asked Marvin dolefully.
 
"I don't know," said Zaphod, "but when I find  him,  he'd  better
have a very good reason for me wanting to see him."
 
Modern elevators are strange and complex  entities.  The  ancient
electric  winch and "maximum-capacity-eight-persons" jobs bear as
much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy  Vertical
People  Transporter  as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire
west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital.
 
This  is  because  they  operate  on  the  curios  principle   of
"defocused  temporal  perception".  In  other words they have the
capacity to see dimly into the immediate  future,  which  enables
the  elevator to be on the right floor to pick you up even before
you  knew  you  wanted  it,  thus  eliminating  all  the  tedious
chatting,   relaxing,   and   making  friends  that  people  were
previously forced to do whist waiting for elevators.
 
Not unnaturally, many  elevators  imbued  with  intelligence  and
precognition   became   terribly  frustrated  with  the  mindless
business of going up and down, up and down, experimented  briefly
with  the  notion  of  going  sideways,  as a sort of existential
protest, demanded participation in  the  decision-making  process
and finally took to squatting in basements sulking.
 
An impoverished hitch-hiker visiting any planets  in  the  Sirius
star  system  these  days  can  pick  up  easy money working as a
counsellor for neurotic elevators.
 
At the fifteenth floor the elevator doors opened quickly.
 
"Fifteenth," said the elevator, "and  remember,  I'm  only  doing
this because I like your robot."
 
Zaphod and Marvin bundled out of  the  elevator  which  instantly
snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would
take it.
 
Zaphod looked around warily. The corridor was deserted and silent
and  gave  no  clue as to where Zarniwoop might be found. All the
doors that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked.
 
They were standing close to the bridge which led across from  one
tower  of  the  building to the other. Through a large window the
brilliant sun of Ursa Minor Beta threw blocks of light  in  which
danced small specks of dust. A shadow flitted past momentarily.
 
"Left in the lurch by a lift," muttered Zaphod, who  was  feeling
at his least jaunty.
 
They both stood and looked in both directions.
 
"You know something?" said Zaphod to Marvin.
 
"More that you can possibly imagine."
 
"I'm dead certain this building  shouldn't  be  shaking,"  Zaphod
said.
 
It was just a light tremor through the soles of his  feet  -  and
another  one.  In  the  sunbeams  the  flecks of dust danced more
vigorously. Another shadow flitted past.
 
Zaphod looked at the floor.
 
"Either," he said, not very confidently, "they've got some  vibro
system for toning up your muscles while you work, or ..."
 
He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled  because  at
that  moment  his  Joo  Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive
sunglasses had turned utterly black. A large shadow flitted  past
the window with a sharp buzz.
 
Zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so  the  building
shook with a thunderous roar. He leapt to the window.
 
"Or," he said, "this building's being bombed!"
 
Another roar cracked through the building.
 
"Who in the Galaxy would want  to  bomb  a  publishing  company?"
asked  Zaphod,  but  never  heard  Marvin's reply because at that
moment the building shook with another bomb attack. He  tried  to
stagger back to the elevator - a pointless manoeuvre he realized,
but the only one he could think of.
 
Suddenly, at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from
this  one,  he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view, a
man. The man saw him.
 
"Beeblebrox, over here!" he shouted.
 
Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb  blast  rocked  the
building.
 
"No," called Zaphod, "Beeblebrox over here! Who are you?"
 
"A friend!" shouted back the man. He ran towards Zaphod.
 
"Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, "Anyone's friend in particular,  or  just
generally well disposed of people?"
 
The man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking  beneath  his
feet   like   an  excited  blanket.  He  was  short,  stocky  and
weatherbeaten and his clothes looked  as  if  they'd  been  twice
round the Galaxy and back with him in them.
 
"Do you know," Zaphod shouted in his ear when he  arrived,  "your
building's being bombed?"
 
The man indicated his awareness.
 
It suddenly stopped being light. Glancing round at the window  to
see   why,  Zaphod  gaped  as  a  huge  sluglike,  gunmetal-green
spacecraft crept through the air  past  the  building.  Two  more
followed it.
 
"The government you deserted is out to get you,  Zaphod,"  hissed
the man, "they've sent a squadron of Frogstar Fighters."
 
"Frogstar Fighters!" muttered Zaphod, "Zarquon!"
 
"You get the picture?"
 
"What are Frogstar Fighters?" Zaphod was sure he'd heard  someone
talk  about  them  when  he was President, but he never paid much
attention to official matters.
 
The man was pulling him back through a door. He  went  with  him.
With  a  searing  whine  a  small  black  spider-like object shot
through the air and disappeared down the corridor.
 
"What was that?" hissed Zaphod.
 
"Frogstar Scout robot class A out looking for you," said the man.
 
"Hey yeah?"
 
"Get down!"
 
From the opposite  direction  came  a  larger  black  spider-like
object. It zapped past them.
 
"And that was ...?"
 
"A Frogstar Scout robot class B out looking for you."
 
"And that?" said Zaphod, as a third one seared through the air.
 
"A Frogstar Scout robot class C out looking for you."
 
"Hey," chuckled Zaphod to himself, "pretty stupid robots eh?"
 
From over the bridge came a  massive  rumbling  hum.  A  gigantic
black  shape was moving over it from the opposite tower, the size
and shape of a tank.
 
"Holy photon, what's that?"
 
"A tank," said the man, "Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get
you."
 
"Should we leave?"
 
"I think we should."
 
"Marvin!" called Zaphod.
 
"What do you want?"
 
Marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the  corridor  and
looked at them.
 
"You see that robot coming towards us?"
 
Marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward  towards
them over the bridge. He looked down at his own small metal body.
He looked back up at the tank.
 
"I suppose you want me to stop it," he said.
 
"Yeah."
 
"Whilst you save your skins."
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "get in there!"
 
"Just so long," said Marvin, "as I know where I stand."
 
The man tugged at Zaphod's arm, and Zaphod followed him off  down
the corridor.
 
A point occurred to him about this.
 
"Where are we going?" he said.
 
"Zarniwoop's office."
 
"Is this any time to keep an appointment?"
 
"Come on."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 7
 
Marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor.  He  was  not  in
fact  a  particularly small robot. His silver body gleamed in the
dusty sunbeams and shook with the  continual  barrage  which  the
building was still undergoing.
 
He did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black  tank
rolled  to  a  halt in front of him. The tank examined him with a
probe. The probe withdrew.
 
Marvin stood there.
 
"Out of my way little robot," growled the tank.
 
"I'm afraid," said Marvin, "that I've  been  left  here  to  stop
you."
 
The probe extended again for a quick recheck. It withdrew again.
 
"You? Stop me?" roared the tank. "Go on!"
 
"No, really I have," said Marvin simply.
 
"What are you armed with?" roared the tank in disbelief.
 
"Guess," said Marvin.
 
The tank's engines  rumbled,  its  gears  ground.  Molecule-sized
electronic  relays  deep in its micro-brain flipped backwards and
forwards in consternation.
 
"Guess?" said the tank.
 
Zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a
second  and  along  a  third.  The building continued to rock and
judder and this puzzled  Zaphod.  If  they  wanted  to  blow  the
building up, why was it taking so long?
 
With difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous
unmarked doors and heaved at it. With a sudden jolt it opened and
they fell inside.
 
All this way, thought Zaphod, all this  trouble,  all  this  not-
lying-on-the-beach-having-a-wonderful-time,   and   for  what?  A
single chair, a single desk and a  single  dirty  ashtray  in  an
undecorated  office.  The  desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust
and single, revolutionary form of paper clip, was empty.
 
"Where," said Zaphod, "is Zarniwoop?" feeling  that  his  already
tenuous  grasp  of the point of this whole exercise was beginning
to slip.
 
"He's on an intergalactic cruise," said the man.
 
Zaphod tried to size the man up. Earnest type, he thought, not  a
barrel  of  laughs.  He  probably apportioned a fair whack of his
time to running up and  down  heaving  corridors,  breaking  down
doors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices.
 
"Let me introduce myself," the man said, "My name is Roosta,  and
this is my towel."
 
"Hello Roosta," said Zaphod.
 
"Hello, towel," he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty
old flowery towel. Not knowing what to do with it, he shook it by
the corner.
 
Outside the window, one of  the  huge  slug-like,  gunmetal-green
spaceships growled past.
 
"Yes, go on," said Marvin to the  huge  battle  machine,  "you'll
never guess."
 
"Errmmm  ..."  said  the  machine,  vibrating  with  unaccustomed
thought, "laser beams?"
 
Marvin shook his head solemnly.
 
"No," muttered the machine in  its  deep  guttural  rumble,  "Too
obvious. Anti-matter ray?" it hazarded.
 
"Far too obvious," admonished Marvin.
 
"Yes," grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed, "Er ... how  about
an electron ram?"
 
This was new to Marvin.
 
"What's that?" he said.
 
"One of these," said the machine with enthusiasm.
 
From its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single  lethal
blaze  of  light.  Behind Marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a
heap of dust. The dust billowed briefly, then settled.
 
"No," said Marvin, "not one of those."
 
"Good though, isn't it?"
 
"Very good," agreed Marvin.
 
"I  know,"  said  the  Frogstar  battle  machine,  after  another
moment's  consideration,  "you must have one of those new Xanthic
Re-Structron Destabilized Zenon Emitters!"
 
"Nice, aren't they?" said Marvin.
 
"That's what you've got?" said the machine in considerable awe.
 
"No," said Marvin.
 
"Oh," said the machine, disappointed, "then it must be ..."
 
"You're thinking along the wrong  lines,"  said  Marvin,  "You're
failing  to  take  into  account  something  fairly  basic in the
relationship between men and robots."
 
"Er, I know," said the battle machine, "is it ..." it tailed  off
into thought again.
 
"Just think," urged Marvin, "they left me,  an  ordinary,  menial
robot,  to stop you, a gigantic heavy-duty battle machine, whilst
they ran off to save themselves. What do  you  think  they  would
leave me with?"
 
"Oooh, er," muttered the machine in alarm, "something pretty damn
devastating I should expect."
 
"Expect!" said Marvin, "oh yes, expect. I'll tell you  what  they
gave me to protect myself with shall I@"
 
"Yes, alright," said the battle machine, bracing itself.
 
"Nothing," said Marvin.
 
There was a dangerous pause.
 
"Nothing?" roared the battle machine.
 
"Nothing at all," intoned Marvin  dismally,  "not  an  electronic
sausage."
 
The machine heaved about with fury.
 
"Well, doesn't that just take the biscuit!" it roared,  "Nothing,
eh? Just don't think, do they?"
 
"And me," said Marvin in a soft low voice,  "with  this  terrible
pain in all the diodes down my left side."
 
"Makes you spit, doesn't it?"
 
"Yes," agreed Marvin with feeling.
 
"Hell that makes me angry," bellowed  the  machine,  "think  I'll
smash that wall down!"
 
The electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of  light  and
took out the wall next to the machine.
 
"How do you think I feel?" said Marvin bitterly.
 
"Just ran off and left you, did they?" the machine thundered.
 
"Yes," said Marvin.
 
"I think I'll shoot down their bloody ceiling as well!" raged the
tank.
 
It took out the ceiling of the bridge.
 
"That's very impressive," murmured Marvin.
 
"You ain't seeing nothing yet," promised the machine, "I can take
out this floor too, no trouble!"
 
It took out the floor, too.
 
"Hell's bells!"  the  machine  roared  as  it  plummeted  fifteen
storeys and smashed itself to bits on the ground below.
 
"What a depressingly stupid machine,"  said  Marvin  and  trudged
away.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 8
 
"So, do we just sit here, or what?" said Zaphod angrily, "what do
these guys out here want?"
 
"You, Beeblebrox," said Roosta, "they're going to take you to the
Frogstar - the most totally evil world in the Galaxy."
 
"Oh, yeah?" said Zaphod. "They'll have to come and get me first."
 
"They have come and got you,"  said  Roosta,  "look  out  of  the
window."
 
Zaphod looked, and gaped.
 
"The ground's going away!" he gasped, "where are they taking  the
ground?"
 
"They're taking the building," said Roosta, "we're airborne."
 
Clouds streaked past the office window.
 
Out in the open air again Zaphod could see the ring of dark green
Frogstar  Fighters  round  the  uprooted tower of the building. A
network of force beams radiated in from them and held  the  tower
in a firm grip.
 
Zaphod shook his head in perplexity.
 
"What have I done to deserve this?"  he  said,  "I  walk  into  a
building, they take it away."
 
"It's not what you've done they're worried about,"  said  Roosta,
"it's what you're going to do."
 
"Well don't I get a say in that?"
 
"You did, years ago. You'd better hold on, we're in  for  a  fast
and bumpy journey."
 
"If I ever meet myself," said Zaphod, "I'll hit myself so hard  I
won't know what's hit me."
 
Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod  accusingly,
slumped in a corner and switched himself off.
 
On the bridge of the Heart of Gold, all was silent. Arthur stared
at  the  rack  in  front of him and thought. He caught Trillian's
eyes as she looked at him inquiringly.  He  looked  back  at  the
rack.
 
Finally he saw it.
 
He picked up five small plastic squares  and  laid  them  on  the
board that lay just in front of the rack.
 
The five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U  and  I.
He laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E.
 
"Exquisite," he said, "on a triple word score.  Scores  rather  a
lot I'm afraid."
 
The ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for  the  'n'th
time.
 
Trillian sighed and started to sort them out again.
 
Up and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect's feet as he
stalked the ship thumping dead instruments.
 
Why did the ship keep shaking? he thought.
 
Why did it rock and sway?
 
Why could he not find out where they were?
 
Where, basically, were they?
 
The left-hand tower of the Hitch  Hiker's  Guide  to  the  Galaxy
offices  streaked  through  interstellar  space  at a speed never
equalled either before or since by any other office block in  the
Universe.
 
In a room halfway up it, Zaphod Beeblebrox strode angrily.
 
Roosta sat on the edge of  the  desk  doing  some  routine  towel
maintenance.
 
"Hey, where did you say this building was  flying  to?"  demanded
Zaphod.
 
"The Frogstar," said Roosta, "the most totally evil place in  the
Universe."
 
"Do they have food there?" said Zaphod.
 
"Food? You're going to the  Frogstar  and  you're  worried  about
whether they got food?"
 
"Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar."
 
Out of the window, they could  see  nothing  but  the  flickering
light  of  the  force  beams,  and vague green streaks which were
presumably the distorted shapes of the Frogstar Fighters. At this
speed, space itself was invisible, and indeed unreal.
 
"Here, suck this," said Roosta, offering Zaphod his towel.
 
Zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to  leap  out  of
his forehead on a small spring.
 
"It's soaked in nutrients," explained Roosta.
 
"What are you, a messy eater or something?" said Zaphod.
 
"The yellow stripes are high in  protein,  the  green  ones  have
vitamin  B  and  C  complexes,  the  little  pink flowers contain
wheatgerm extracts."
 
Zaphod took and looked at it in amazement.
 
"What are the brown stains?" he asked.
 
"Bar-B-Q sauce," said Roosta, "for when I get sick of wheatgerm."
 
Zaphod sniffed it doubtfully.
 
Even more doubtfully, he sucked a corner. He spat it out again.
 
"Ugh," he stated.
 
"Yes," said Roosta, "when I've had to suck  that  end  I  usually
need to suck the other end a bit too."
 
"Why," asked Zaphod suspiciously, "what's in that?"
 
"Anti-depressants," said Roosta.
 
"I've gone right off this towel, you know," said  Zaphod  handing
it back.
 
Roosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk,  walked
round it, sat in the chair and put his feet up.
 
"Beeblebrox," he said, sticking his hands behind his head,  "have
you any idea what's going to happen to you on the Frogstar?"
 
"They're going to feed me?" hazarded Zaphod hopefully.
 
"They're going  to  feed  you,"  said  Roosta,  "into  the  Total
Perspective Vortex!"
 
Zaphod had never heard of this. He believed that he had heard  of
all  the  fun  things in the Galaxy, so he assumed that the Total
Perspective Vortex was not fun. He asked what it was.
 
"Only," said Roosta, "the most savage psychic torture a sentinent
being can undergo."
 
Zaphod nodded a resigned nod.
 
"So," he said, "no food, huh?"
 
"Listen!" said Roosta urgently, "you can kill a man, destroy  his
body, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can
annihilate a man's soul! The treatment  lasts  seconds,  but  the
effect lasts the rest of your life!"
 
"You ever had  a  Pan  Galactic  Gargle  Blaster?"  asked  Zaphod
sharply.
 
"This is worse."
 
"Phreeow!" admitted Zaphod, much impressed.
 
"Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me?" he added a
moment later.
 
"They believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever.
They know what you're after."
 
"Could they drop me a note and let me know as well?"
 
"You know," said Roosta, "you know, Beeblebrox. You want to  meet
the man who rules the Universe."
 
"Can he cook?" said Zaphod. On reflection he added:
 
"I doubt if he can. If he could cook  a  good  meal  he  wouldn't
worry about the rest of the Universe. I want to meet a cook."
 
Roosta sighed heavily.
 
"What are you doing here anyway?" demanded  Zaphod,  "what's  all
this got to so with you?"
 
"I'm just one  of  those  who  planned  this  thing,  along  with
Zarniwoop,  along  with  Yooden  Vranx,  along  with  your  great
grandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox."
 
"Me?"
 
"Yes, you. I was told you  had  changed,  I  didn't  realize  how
much."
 
"But ..."
 
"I am here to do one job. I will do it before I leave you."
 
"What job, man, what are you talking about?"
 
"I will do it before I leave you."
 
Roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence.
 
Zaphod was terribly glad.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 9
 
The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale
and unwholesome.
 
The dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over
salt  flats,  dried  up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation
and the crumbling remains of ruined cities. No life moved  across
its  surface.  The ground, like that of many planets in this part
of the Galaxy, had long been deserted.
 
The howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the
old  decaying  houses  of  the cities; it was more desolate as it
whipped about the bottoms of the tall black  towers  that  swayed
uneasily  here  and there about the surface of this world. At the
top of these  towers  lived  colonies  of  large,  scraggy,  evil
smelling  birds, the sole survivors of the civilization that once
lived here.
 
The howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however,  when  it
passed  over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey
plain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities.
 
This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned  this  world
the  reputation  of  being  the  most  totally  evil place in the
Galaxy. From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet
across. From within it was something more monstrous than the mind
can comprehend.
 
About a hundred yards or so away, and  separated  from  it  by  a
pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable
was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad  of
sorts. That is to say that scattered over a largish area were the
ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed buildings.
 
Flitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind  that
was waiting for something.
 
The mind directed its attention into the  air,  and  before  very
long  a  distant  speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller
specks.
 
The larger speck was the left-hand tower  of  the  Hitch  Hiker's
Guide  to  the  Galaxy  office  building,  descending through the
stratosphere of Frogstar World B.
 
As it descended, Roosta suddenly  broke  the  long  uncomfortable
silence that had grown up between the two men.
 
He stood up and gathered his towel into a bag. He said:
 
"Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do."
 
Zaphod looked up at him from where he was  sitting  in  a  corner
sharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin.
 
"Yeah?" he said.
 
"The building  will  shortly  be  landing.  When  you  leave  the
building, do not go out of the door," said Roosta, "go out of the
window."
 
"Good luck," he added, and walked out of the  door,  disappearing
from Zaphod's life as mysteriously as he had entered it.
 
Zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already looked
it. He shrugged and returned to the corner.
 
Two minutes later, the building  crashlanded  amongst  the  other
wreckage. Its escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force
beams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World
A,  an  altogether  more  congenial  spot.  They  never landed on
Frogstar World B. No one did. No one ever walked on  its  surface
other than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex.
 
Zaphod was badly shaken by the crash. He lay for a while  in  the
silent  dusty  rubble to which most of the room had been reduced.
He felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in  his
life.  He  felt  bewildered,  he  felt  lonely,  he felt unloved.
Eventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with.
 
He looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had  split
round the door frame, and the door hung open. The window, by some
miracle was closed and unbroken. For a while he  hesitated,  then
he  thought  that  if  his  strange and recent companion had been
through all that he had been through just to tell him what he had
told  him, then there must be a good reason for it. With Marvin's
help he got the window  open.  Outside  it,  the  cloud  of  dust
aroused  by  the crash, and the hulks of the other buildings with
which this one was surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod  from
seeing anything of the world outside.
 
Not that this concerned him unduly. His main concern was what  he
saw  when he looked down. Zarniwoop's office was on the fifteenth
floor. The building had landed at  a  tilt  of  about  forty-five
degrees, but still the descent looked heart-stopping.
 
Eventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous  looks
that  Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and
clambered out on to the steeply inclined side  of  the  building.
Marvin  followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and
painfully down the fifteen floors that separated  them  from  the
ground.
 
As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs,  his  eyes
smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin.
 
The occasional remark from Marvin of the order of  "This  is  the
sort  of  thing  you  lifeforms  enjoy  is  it?  I ask merely for
information," did little to improve his state of mind.
 
About half-way down the  side  of  the  shattered  building  they
stopped to rest. It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with
fear and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful  than
usual.  Eventually  he  realized  this  wasn't so. The robot just
seemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood.
 
A large, scraggy black bird  came  flapping  through  the  slowly
settling  clouds  of  dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs,
landed on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod.
It folded its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch.
 
Its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head
and  neck  seemed  curiously large for a bird. Its face was flat,
the beak underdeveloped, and half-way along the underside of  its
wings the vestiges of something handlike could be clearly seen.
 
In fact, it looked almost human.
 
It turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and  clicked  its  beak  in  a
desultory fashion.
 
"Go away," said Zaphod.
 
"OK," muttered the bird morosely and flapped off  into  the  dust
again.
 
Zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment.
 
"Did that bird just talk to me?" he asked  Marvin  nervously.  He
was  quite  prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that
he was in fact hallucinating.
 
"Yes," confirmed Marvin.
 
"Poor souls," said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod's ear.
 
Twisting round violently to find the source of the  voice  nearly
caused  Zaphod to fall off the building. He grabbed savagely at a
protruding window fitting and cut his hand on  it.  He  hung  on,
breathing heavily.
 
The voice had no visible source  whatever  -  there  was  no  one
there. Nevertheless, it spoke again.
 
"A tragic history behind them, you know. A terrible blight."
 
Zaphod looked wildly about. The voice  was  deep  and  quiet.  In
other circumstances it would even be described as soothing. There
is,  however,  nothing  soothing  about  being  addressed  by   a
disembodied  voice  out of nowhere, particularly if you are, like
Zaphod Beeblebrox, not at your best  and  hanging  from  a  ledge
eight storeys up a crashed building.
 
"Hey, er ..." he stammered.
 
"Shall I tell you their story?" inquired the voice quietly.
 
"Hey, who are you?" panted Zaphod. "Where are you?"
 
"Later then, perhaps," murmured the voice. "I am Gargravarr. I am
the Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex."
 
"Why can't I see ..."
 
"You  will  find  your  progress  down   the   building   greatly
facilitated,"  the  voice lifted, "if you move about two yards to
your left. Why don't you try it?"
 
Zaphod looked and  saw  a  series  of  short  horizontal  grooves
leading  all the way down the side of the building. Gratefully he
shifted himself across to them.
 
"Why don't I see you again at the bottom?" said the voice in  his
ear, and as it spoke it faded.
 
"Hey," called out Zaphod, "Where are you ..."
 
"It'll only take a couple of minutes ..."  said  the  voice  very
faintly.
 
"Marvin," said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly
next to him, "Did a ... did a voice just ..."
 
"Yes," Marvin replied tersely.
 
Zaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses  again.
They  were  completely black, and by now quite badly scratched by
the unexpected metal object in his pocket. He  put  them  on.  He
would  find  his  way  down  the  building more comfortably if he
didn't actually have to look at what he was doing.
 
Minutes  later  he  clambered  over  the   ripped   and   mangled
foundations   of   the  building  and,  once  more  removing  his
sunglasses, he dropped to the ground.
 
Marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down  in  the
dust and rubble, from which position he seemed too disinclined to
move.
 
"Ah, there you are," said the voice  suddenly  in  Zaphod's  ear,
"excuse  me  leaving  you  like  that,  it's  just  that I have a
terrible head for heights. At least," it added wistfully, "I  did
have a terrible head for heights."
 
Zaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he  had
missed  something  which might be the source of the voice. All he
saw, however, was the dust, the rubble and the towering hulks  of
the encircling buildings.
 
"Hey, er, why can't I see you?" he said, "why aren't you here?"
 
"I am here," said the voice slowly, "my body wanted to  come  but
it's  a  bit  busy  at  the moment. Things to do, people to see."
After what seemed like a sort of ethereal  sigh  it  added,  "You
know how it is with bodies."
 
Zaphod wasn't sure about this.
 
"I thought I did," he said.
 
"I only hope it's gone for a rest  cure,"  continued  the  voice,
"the  way  it's  been  living  recently  it  must  be on its last
elbows."
 
"Elbows?" said Zaphod, "don't you mean last legs?"
 
The  voice  said  nothing  for  a  while.  Zaphod  looked  around
uneasily.  He  didn't  know  if it was gone or was still there or
what it was doing. Then the voice spoke again.
 
"So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes?"
 
"Er, well," said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at  nonchalance,
"this  cat's  in  no hurry, you know. I can just slouch about and
take in a look at the local scenery, you know?"
 
"Have you seen the local scenery?" asked the voice of Gargravarr.
 
"Er, no."
 
Zaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner  of  one
of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view.
 
He looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B.
 
"Ah, OK," he said, "I'll just sort of slouch about then."
 
"No," said Gargravarr, "the Vortex is ready for you now. You must
come. Follow me."
 
"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, "and how am I meant to do that?"
 
"I'll hum for you," said Gargravarr, "follow the humming."
 
A soft keening sound drifted through the air, a pale,  sad  sound
that  seemed  to  be  without  any  kind of focus. It was only by
listening very carefully that  Zaphod  was  able  to  detect  the
direction  from which it was coming. Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled
off in its wake. What else was there to do?
 
=================================================================
Chapter 10
 
The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big
place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend
to ignore.
 
Many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their  own
devising, and this is what most beings in fact do.
 
For instance, in one corner of the Eastern Galactic Arm lies  the
large forest planet Oglaroon, the entire "intelligent" population
of which lives permanently in one fairly small  and  crowded  nut
tree. In which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny
speculative articles in the bark on  the  meaning  of  life,  the
futility  of  death  and the importance of birth control, fight a
few extremely minor wars, and  eventually  die  strapped  to  the
underside of some of the less accessible outer branches.
 
In fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those
who  are  hurled  out  of  it  for the heinous crime of wondering
whether any of the other trees might  be  capable  of  supporting
life at all, or indeed whether the other trees are anything other
than illusions brought on by eating too many Oglanuts.
 
Exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life  form  in
the  Galaxy  which  is  not in some way guilty of the same thing,
which is why the Total Perspective Vortex is as  horrific  as  it
is.
 
For when you are put into the  Vortex  you  are  given  just  one
momentary   glimpse   of  the  entire  unimaginable  infinity  of
creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic
dot on a microscopic dot, which says "You are here."
 
The grey plain  stretched  before  Zaphod,  a  ruined,  shattered
plain. The wind whipped wildly over it.
 
Visible in the middle was the steel pimple  of  the  dome.  This,
gathered  Zaphod,  was  where  he  was  going. This was the Total
Perspective Vortex.
 
As he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a  sudden  inhuman  wail  of
terror  emanated  from  it as of a man having his soul burnt from
his body. It screamed above the wind and died away.
 
Zaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn  to  liquid
helium.
 
"Hey, what was that?" he muttered voicelessly.
 
"A recording," said Gargravarr, "of the last man who was  put  in
the  Vortex.  It  is  always played to the next victim. A sort of
prelude."
 
"Hey, it really sounds bad ..." stammered  Zaphod,  "couldn't  we
maybe  slope  off  to  a party or something for a while, think it
over?"
 
"For all I know," said Gargravarr's ethereal voice, "I'm probably
at  one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me.
Says I only get in the way. Hey ho."
 
"What is all this with your body?" said Zaphod, anxious to  delay
whatever it was that was going to happen to him.
 
"Well, it's ... it's busy you know," said Gargravarr hesitantly.
 
"You mean it's got a mind of its own?" said Zaphod.
 
There was a long and  slightly  chilly  pause  before  Gargravarr
spoke again.
 
"I have to say," he replied eventually, "that I find that  remark
in rather poor taste."
 
Zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology.
 
"No matter," said Gargravarr, "you weren't to know."
 
The voice fluttered unhappily.
 
"The truth is," it continued in  tones  which  suggested  he  was
trying  very hard to keep it under control, "the truth is that we
are currently undergoing a period of legal  trial  separation.  I
suspect it will end in divorce."
 
The voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to
say. He mumbled uncertainly.
 
"I think we are probably not very well suited,"  said  Gargravarr
again  at  length,  "we  never  seemed to be happy doing the same
things. We  always  had  the  greatest  arguments  over  sex  and
fishing.  Eventually  we  tried to combine the two, but that only
led to disaster, as you can probably imagine.  And  now  my  body
refuses to let me in. It won't even see me ..."
 
He paused again, tragically. The wind whipped across the plain.
 
"It says I only inhibit it. I pointed out  that  in  fact  I  was
meant  to  inhibit it, and it said that that was exactly the sort
of smart alec remark that got right up a body's left nostril, and
so we left it. It will probably get custody of my forename."
 
"Oh ..." said Zaphod faintly, "and what's that?"
 
"Pizpot," said the voice, "My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says  it
all really doesn't it?"
 
"Errr ..." said Zaphod sympathetically.
 
"And that is why  I,  as  a  disembodied  mind,  have  this  job,
Custodian  of the Total Perspective Vortex. No one will ever walk
on the ground of this planet. Except the victims of the Vortex  -
they don't really count I'm afraid."
 
"Ah ..."
 
"I'll tell you the story. Would you like to hear it?"
 
"Er ..."
 
"Many years ago this was  a  thriving,  happy  planet  -  people,
cities  shops, a normal world. Except that on the high streets of
these cities there were slightly more shoe shops than  one  might
have  thought  necessary. And slowly, insidiously, the numbers of
these shoe shops were increasing.  It's  a  well  known  economic
phenomenon  but  tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe
shops there were, the more shoes they had to make and  the  worse
and more unwearable they became. And the worse they were to wear,
the more people had to buy to keep themselves shod, and the  more
the  shops  proliferated,  until  the  whole economy of the place
passed what I believe is termed the Shoe Event  Horizon,  and  it
became  no  longer  economically possible to build anything other
than shoe shops. Result - collapse, ruin and famine. Most of  the
population  died out. Those few who had the right kind of genetic
instability mutated into birds - you've seen one of  them  -  who
cursed  their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed that none should
walk on it again. Unhappy lot. Come,  I  must  take  you  to  the
Vortex."
 
Zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled  forward  across
the plain.
 
"And you," he said, "you come from this hellhole pit do you?"
 
"No no," said Gargravarr, taken aback, "I come from the  Frogstar
World C. Beautiful place. Wonderful fishing. I flit back there in
the evenings. Though all  I  can  do  now  is  watch.  The  Total
Perspective  Vortex  is  the  only  thing on this planet with any
function. It was built here because no  one  else  wanted  it  on
their doorstep."
 
At that moment another dismal scream  rent  the  air  and  Zaphod
shuddered.
 
"What can do that to a guy?" he breathed.
 
"The Universe,"  said  Gargravarr  simply,  "the  whole  infinite
Universe. The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them,
and yourself an invisible dot on  an  invisible  dot,  infinitely
small."
 
"Hey, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox,  man,  you  know,"  muttered  Zaphod
trying to flap the last remnants of his ego.
 
Gargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming
till  they  reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the
plain.
 
As they reached it, a door hummed open in the side,  revealing  a
small darkened chamber within.
 
"Enter," said Gargravarr.
 
Zaphod started with fear.
 
"Hey, what, now?" he said.
 
"Now."
 
Zaphod peered nervously inside. The chamber was  very  small.  It
was  steel-lined  and  there was hardly space in it for more than
one man.
 
"It ... er ... it doesn't look like any kind of  Vortex  to  me,"
said Zaphod.
 
"It isn't," said Gargravarr, "it's just the elevator. Enter."
 
With infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it. He was aware of
Gargravarr being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied
man was not for the moment speaking.
 
The elevator began its descent.
 
"I must get myself into  the  right  frame  of  mind  for  this,"
muttered Zaphod.
 
"There is no right frame of mind," said Gargravarr sternly.
 
"You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate."
 
"I don't. The Vortex does."
 
At the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the  elevator  opened  up
and  Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel-lined
chamber.
 
At the far side of it stood a  single  upright  steel  box,  just
large enough for a man to stand in.
 
It was that simple.
 
It connected to a small pile of components and instruments via  a
single thick wire.
 
"Is that it?" said Zaphod in surprise.
 
"That is it."
 
Didn't look too bad, thought Zaphod.
 
"And I get in there do I?" said Zaphod.
 
"You get in there," said Gargravarr, "and I'm afraid you must  do
it now."
 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod.
 
He opened the door of the box and stepped in.
 
Inside the box he waited.
 
After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was
there in the box with him.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 11
 
The Total Perspective Vortex derives its  picture  of  the  whole
Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses.
 
To explain - since every piece of matter in the  Universe  is  in
some way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe,
it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of  creation  -
every  sun,  every  planet,  their  orbits, their composition and
their economic and social history from, say, one small  piece  of
fairy cake.
 
The  man  who  invented  the  Total  Perspective  Vortex  did  so
basically in order to annoy his wife.
 
Trin Tragula - for that was his name - was a dreamer, a  thinker,
a  speculative  philosopher  or,  as  his  wife would have it, an
idiot.
 
And she would nag him incessantly about  the  utterly  inordinate
amount  of  time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over
the mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of
pieces of fairy cake.
 
"Have some sense of proportion!"  she  would  say,  sometimes  as
often as thirty-eight times in a single day.
 
And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex - just to show her.
 
And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as  extrapolated
from a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his
wife: so that when he turned it on she saw  in  one  instant  the
whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it.
 
To Trin Tragula's horror, the shock  completely  annihilated  her
brain;  but  to  his  satisfaction he realized that he had proved
conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this
size,  then  the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of
proportion.
 
The door of the Vortex swung open.
 
From his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly.  He  had
rather  liked  Zaphod Beeblebrox in a strange sort of way. He was
clearly a man of many qualities, even if  they  were  mostly  bad
ones.
 
He waited for him to flop forwards out of the box,  as  they  all
did.
 
Instead, he stepped out.
 
"Hi!" he said.
 
"Beeblebrox ..." gasped Gargravarr's mind in amazement.
 
"Could I have a drink please?" said Zaphod.
 
"You ... you ... have been in the Vortex?" stammered Gargravarr.
 
"You saw me, kid."
 
"And it was working?"
 
"Sure was."
 
"And you saw the whole infinity of creation?"
 
"Sure. Really neat place, you know that?"
 
Gargravarr's mind was reeling in astonishment. Had his body  been
with  him  it  would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging
open.
 
"And you saw yourself," said Gargravarr, "in relation to it all?"
 
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
 
"But ... what did you experience?"
 
Zaphod shrugged smugly.
 
"It just told me what I knew all the time. I'm a really  terrific
and great guy. Didn't I tell you, baby, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox!"
 
His gaze passed over the machinery which powered the  vortex  and
suddenly stopped, startled.
 
He breathed heavily.
 
"Hey," he said, "is that really a piece of fairy cake?"
 
He ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors  with
which it was surrounded.
 
"If I told you how much I needed this," he  said  ravenously,  "I
wouldn't have time to eat it."
 
He ate it.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 12
 
 A short while later he was  running  across  the  plain  in  the
direction of the ruined city.
 
The dank air wheezed heavily  in  his  lungs  and  he  frequently
stumbled  with  the  exhaustion  he  was still feeling. Night was
beginning to fall too, and the rough ground was treacherous.
 
The elation of his recent experience was still with  him  though.
The  whole Universe. He had seen the whole Universe stretching to
infinity around him - everything. And with it had come the  clear
and  extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing
in it. Having a conceited ego is one thing. Actually  being  told
by a machine is another.
 
He didn't have time to reflect on this matter.
 
Gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert  his  masters
as  to  what  had  happened,  but that he was prepared to leave a
decent interval before doing so. Enough time for Zaphod to make a
break and find somewhere to hide.
 
What he was going to do he didn't know, but feeling that  he  was
the most important person in the Universe gave him the confidence
to believe that something would turn up.
 
Nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much  grounds
for optimism.
 
He ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city.
 
He walked along cracked and gaping  roads  riddled  with  scrawny
weeds,  the  holes  filled  with  rotting shoes. The buildings he
passed were so crumbled and decrepit  he  thought  it  unsafe  to
enter any of them. Where could he hide? He hurried on.
 
After a while the remains of a wide sweeping road  led  off  from
the  one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low
building,  surrounded  with  sundry  smaller  ones,   the   whole
surrounded  by the remains of a perimeter barrier. The large main
building still seemed reasonably solid, and Zaphod turned off  to
see if it might provide him with ... well with anything.
 
He approached the building. Along one side of it - the  front  it
would  seem  since  it  faced  a wide concreted apron area - were
three gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high. The far one of these
was open, and towards this, Zaphod ran.
 
Inside, all was gloom, dust and confusion. Giant cobwebs lay over
everything.  Part  of  the  infrastructure  of  the  building had
collapsed, part of the rear  wall  had  caved  in,  and  a  thick
choking dust lay inches over the floor.
 
Through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with debris.
 
The  shapes  were  sometimes  cylindrical,   sometimes   bulbous,
sometimes  like  eggs,  or rather cracked eggs. Most of them were
split open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons.
 
They were all spacecraft, all derelict.
 
Zaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks. There was nothing
here  that  remotely  approached  the  serviceable. Even the mere
vibration  of  his  footsteps  caused  one  precarious  wreck  to
collapse further into itself.
 
Towards the rear of the  building  lay  one  old  ship,  slightly
larger  than  the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of
dust and cobwebs. Its outline, however, seemed  unbroken.  Zaphod
approached it with interest, and as he did so, he tripped over an
old feedline.
 
He tried  to  toss  the  feedline  aside,  and  to  his  surprise
discovered that it was still connected to the ship.
 
To his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was  also
humming slightly.
 
He stared at the ship in disbelief, and then  back  down  at  the
feedline in his hands.
 
He tore off his jacket and threw it aside. Crawling along on  his
hands  and  knees  he followed the feedline to the point where it
connected with the ship. The connection was sound, and the slight
humming vibration was more distinct.
 
His heart was beating fast. He wiped away some grime and laid  an
ear  against  the  ship's  side.  He  could  only  hear  a faint,
indeterminate noise.
 
He rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor  all
about  him  and  found  a  short  length  of  tubing,  and a non-
biodegradable plastic cup. Out  of  this  he  fashioned  a  crude
stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship.
 
What he heard made his brains turn somersaults.
 
The voice said:
 
"Transtellar Cruise Lines would like to apologize  to  passengers
for  the  continuing  delay  to  this  flight.  We  are currently
awaiting the loading of  our  complement  of  small  lemon-soaked
paper  napkins  for  your comfort, refreshment and hygiene during
the journey. Meanwhile we thank you for your patience. The  cabin
crew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again."
 
Zaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship.
 
He walked around for a few moments in a  daze.  In  so  doing  he
suddenly  caught  sight of a giant departure board still hanging,
but by only one support, from  the  ceiling  above  him.  It  was
covered   with   grime,  but  some  of  the  figures  were  still
discernible.
 
Zaphod's eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some  brief
calculations. His eyes widened.
 
"Nine hundred years ..." he breathed to  himself.  That  was  how
late the ship was.
 
Two minutes later he was on board.
 
As he stepped out of the airlock, the air that  greeted  him  was
cool and fresh - the air conditioning was still working.
 
The lights were still on.
 
He moved out of the small entrance chamber into  a  short  narrow
corridor and stepped nervously down it.
 
Suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him.
 
"Please return to your seat sir,"  said  the  android  stewardess
and,  turning her back on him, she walked on down the corridor in
front of him.
 
When his heart had started beating again  he  followed  her.  She
opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through.
 
He followed her through the door.
 
They were now in the passenger  compartment  and  Zaphod's  heart
stopped still again for a moment.
 
In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat.
 
The passengers' hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were
long, the men wore beards.
 
All of them were quite clearly alive - but sleeping.
 
Zaphod had the creeping horrors.
 
He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream. By the time he was
half-way  down  the  aisle,  the stewardess had reached the other
end. She turned and spoke.
 
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen," she said  sweetly,  "Thank
you  for  bearing  with  us  during this slight delay. We will be
taking off as soon as we possibly can. If you would like to  wake
up now I will serve you coffee and biscuits."
 
There was a slight hum.
 
At that moment, all the passengers awoke.
 
They awoke screaming and clawing at their straps and life support
systems  that held them tightly in their seats. They screamed and
bawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter.
 
They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently  moved  up
the  aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits
in front of each one of them.
 
Then one of them rose from his seat.
 
He turned and looked at Zaphod.
 
Zaphod's skin was crawling all over his body as if it was  trying
to get off. He turned and ran from the bedlam.
 
He plunged through the door and back into the corridor.
 
The man pursued him.
 
He raced in a frenzy to the end  of  the  corridor,  through  the
entrance  chamber  and  beyond.  He  arrived  on the flight deck,
slammed and bolted the door behind him. He leant back against the
door breathing hard.
 
Within seconds, a hand started beating on the door.
 
From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him.
 
"Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. Please return  to
your seat, and wait for the ship to take off. Coffee and biscuits
are being served. This is your autopilot speaking. Please  return
to your seat."
 
Zaphod said nothing. He  breathed  hard,  behind  him,  the  hand
continued to knock on the door.
 
"Please return to your seat," repeated the autopilot. "Passengers
are not allowed on the flight deck."
 
"I'm not a passenger," panted Zaphod.
 
"Please return to your seat."
 
"I am not a passenger!" shouted Zaphod again.
 
"Please return to your seat."
 
"I am not a ... hello, can you hear me?"
 
"Please return to your seat."
 
You're the autopilot?" said Zaphod.
 
"Yes," said the voice from the flight console.
 
"You're in charge of this ship?"
 
"Yes," said the voice again, "there has been a delay.  Passengers
are  to  be  kept  temporarily  in suspended animation, for their
comfort and convenience. Coffee and  biscuits  are  being  served
every  year,  after  which  passengers  are returned to suspended
animation for their continued comfort and convenience.  Departure
will take place when the flight stores are complete. We apologize
for the delay."
 
Zaphod moved away from the door, on which the  pounding  had  now
ceased. He approached the flight console.
 
"Delay?" he cried, "Have you seen the world  outside  this  ship?
It's  a  wasteland,  a desert. Civilization's been and gone, man.
There  are  no  lemon-soaked  paper  napkins  on  the  way   from
anywhere!"
 
"The statistical likelihood," continued the autopilot primly, "is
that  other  civilizations  will  arise.  There  will  one day be
lemon-soaked paper napkins. Till  then  there  will  be  a  short
delay. Please return to your seat."
 
"But ..."
 
But at that moment the door opened. Zaphod span round to see  the
man  who  had  pursued  him  standing  there.  He carried a large
briefcase. He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short. He had
no beard and no long fingernails.
 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox," he said, "My name is  Zarniwoop.  I  believe
you wanted to see me."
 
Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said  foolish  things.  He
dropped into a chair.
 
"Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from?" he said.
 
"I've been waiting here for you," he said in a businesslike tone.
 
He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair.
 
"I am glad you followed instructions," he  said,  "I  was  a  bit
nervous  that  you  might  have left my office by the door rather
than the window. Then you would have been in trouble."
 
Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled.
 
"When  you  entered  the  door  of  my  office,  you  entered  my
electronically  synthesized  Universe," he explained, "if you had
left by the door you would have been back in the  real  one.  The
artificial one works from here."
 
He patted the briefcase smugly.
 
Zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing.
 
"What's the difference?" he muttered.
 
"Nothing," said Zarniwoop, "they are identical. Oh - except  that
I think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in the real Universe."
 
"What's going on?" spat Zaphod.
 
"Simple," said Zarniwoop. His self assurance  and  smugness  made
Zaphod seethe.
 
"Very simple," repeated Zarniwoop, "I discovered the  coordinated
at  which  this  man  could  be  found  -  the  man who rules the
Universe, and discovered that  his  world  was  protected  by  an
Unprobability  field.  To  protect  my  secret  -  and myself - I
retreated to the safety of this totally artificial  Universe  and
hid  myself  away  in  a  forgotten  cruise  liner. I was secure.
Meanwhile, you and I ..."
 
"You and I?" said Zaphod angrily, "you mean I knew you?"
 
"Yes," said Zarniwoop, "we knew each other well."
 
"I had no taste," said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence.
 
"Meanwhile,  you  and  I  arranged  that  you  would  steal   the
Improbability  Drive  ship  -  the only one which could reach the
ruler's world - and bring it to me here. This you have now done I
trust,  and  I  congratulate you." He smiled a tight little smile
which Zaphod wanted to hit with a brick.
 
"Oh, and in case you  were  wondering,"  added  Zarniwoop,  "this
Universe  was  created  specifically  for you to come to. You are
therefore the most important person in this Universe.  You  would
never," he said with an even more brickable smile, "have survived
the Total Perspective Vortex in the real one. Shall we go?"
 
"Where?" said Zaphod sullenly. He felt collapsed.
 
"To your ship. The Heart of Gold. You did bring it I trust?"
 
"No."
 
"Where is your jacket?"
 
Zaphod looked at him in mystification.
 
"My jacket? I took it off. It's outside."
 
"Good, we will go and find it."
 
Zarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zaphod to follow him.
 
Out in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of
the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits.
 
"It has not been a pleasant experience  waiting  for  you,"  said
Zarniwoop.
 
"Not pleasant for you!" bawled Zaphod, "How do you think ..."
 
Zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung  open.
A few feet away from them they could see Zaphod's jacket lying in
the debris.
 
"A very remarkable  and  very  powerful  ship,"  said  Zarniwoop,
"watch."
 
As they watched, the pocket on the  jacket  suddenly  bulged.  It
split, it ripped. The small metal model of the Heart of Gold that
Zaphod had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing.
 
It grew, it continued to grow. It reached, after two minutes, its
full size.
 
"At an Improbability Level," said Zarniwoop, "of ... oh  I  don't
know, but something very large."
 
Zaphod swayed.
 
"You mean I had it with me all the time?"
 
"Zarniwoop smiled. He lifted up his briefcase and opened it.
 
He twisted a single switch inside it.
 
"Goodbye artificial Universe," he said, "hello real one!"
 
The scene before them shimmered briefly - and reappeared  exactly
as before.
 
"You see?" said Zarniwoop, "exactly the same."
 
 "You mean," repeated Zaphod tautly, "that I had it with  me  all
the time?"
 
"Oh yes," said Zarniwoop, "of course. That was the whole point."
 
"That's it," said Zaphod, "you can count me out, from  hereon  in
you  can count me out. I've had all I want of this. You play your
own games."
 
"I'm afraid you cannot leave," said Zarniwoop, "you are  entwined
in the Improbability field. You cannot escape."
 
He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and  this  time
Zaphod hit it.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 13
 
Ford Prefect bounded up to the bridge of the Heart of Gold.
 
"Trillian!  Arthur!"  he  shouted,  "it's  working!  The   ship's
reactivated!"
 
Trillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor.
 
"Come on you guys, we're going off, we're off," he  said  kicking
them awake.
 
"Hi there guys!" twittered the computer, "it's really great to be
back  with you again, I can tell you, and I just want to say that
..."
 
"Shut up," said Ford, "tell us where the hell we are."
 
"Frogstar World B, and man it's a dump," said Zaphod  running  on
to the bridge, "hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me
you don't even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am."
 
"What a what?" said Arthur blearily, picking himself up from  the
floor and not taking any of this in.
 
"I know how you feel," said Zaphod, "I'm  so  great  even  I  get
tongue-tied talking to myself. Hey it's good to see you Trillian,
Ford, Monkeyman. Hey, er, computer ...?"
 
"Hi there, Mr Beeblebrox sir, sure is a great honor to ..."
 
"Shut up and get us out of here, fast fast fast."
 
"Sure thing, fella, where do you want to go?"
 
"Anywhere, doesn't matter," shouted Zaphod,  "yes  it  does!"  he
said again, "we want to go to the nearest place to eat!"
 
"Sure thing," said the computer happily and a  massive  explosion
rocket the bridge.
 
When Zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye,  he
regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 14
 
Four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness.  Consciousness
had  died, cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the
pit of unbeing. The roar of silence echoed dismally  around  them
and  they  sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red
that slowly engulfed them, seemingly for ever.
 
After what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying
on  a  cold  hard  shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of
Life, the Universe, and Everything.
 
Cold spasms shook them, lights danced  sickeningly  around  them.
The  cold  hard  shore  tipped  and span and then stood still. It
shone darkly - it was a very highly polished cold hard shore.
 
A green blur watched them disapprovingly.
 
It coughed.
 
"Good evening,  madam,  gentlemen,"  it  said,  "do  you  have  a
reservation?"
 
Ford Prefect's consciousness snapped back  like  elastic,  making
his brain smart. He looked up woozily at the green blur.
 
"Reservation?" he said weakly. "Yes, sir," said the green blur.
 
"Do you need a reservation for the afterlife?"
 
In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows
disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did.
 
"Afterlife, sir?" it said.
 
Arthur Dent was grappling with  his  consciousness  the  way  one
grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath.
 
"Is this the afterlife?" he stammered.
 
"Well I assume so," said Ford Prefect trying to  work  out  which
way was up. He tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite
direction from the cold hard shore on which  he  was  lying,  and
staggered to what he hoped were his feet.
 
"I mean," he said, swaying gently, "there's no way we could  have
survived that blast is there?"
 
"No," muttered Arthur. He had raised himself on to his elbows but
it didn't seem to improve things. He slumped down again.
 
"No," said Trillian, standing up, "no way at all."
 
A dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor. It  was  Zaphod
Beeblebrox  attempting to speak. "I certainly didn't survive," he
gurgled, "I was a total goner. Wham bang and that was it."
 
"Yeah, thanks to you," said Ford, "We didn't stand a  chance.  We
must have been blown to bits. Arms, legs everywhere."
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod struggling noisily to his feet.
 
"If the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks  ..."  said
the green blur, hovering impatiently beside them.
 
"Kerpow, splat," continued Zaphod, "instantaneously  zonked  into
our  component molecules. Hey, Ford," he said, identifying one of
the slowly solidifying blurs around him, "did you get that  thing
of your whole life flashing before you?"
 
"You got that too?" said Ford, "your whole life?"
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "at least I assume it was mine.  I  spent  a
lot of time out of my skulls you know."
 
He looked at around him at the various shapes that were  at  last
becoming  proper  shapes  instead of vague and wobbling shapeless
shapes.
 
"So ..." he said.
 
"So what?" said Ford.
 
"So here we are," said Zaphod hesitantly, "lying dead ..."
 
"Standing," Trillian corrected him.
 
"Er, standing dead," continued Zaphod, "in this desolate ..."
 
"Restaurant," said Arthur Dent who had got to his feet and  could
now, much to his surprise, see clearly. That is to say, the thing
that surprised him was not that he could see, but what  he  could
see.
 
"Here we are," continued Zaphod doggedly, "standing dead in  this
desolate ..."
 
"Five star ..." said Trillian.
 
"Restaurant," concluded Zaphod.
 
"Odd isn't it?" said Ford.
 
"Er, yeah."
 
"Nice chandeliers though," said Trillian.
 
They looked about themselves in bemusement.
 
"It's not so much an afterlife," said Arthur,  "more  a  sort  of
apres vie."
 
The chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and  the
low  vaulted  ceiling from which they hung would not, in an ideal
Universe, have been painted in  that  particular  shade  of  deep
turquoise,  and  even  if  it  had  been  it  wouldn't  have been
highlighted by concealed moodlighting. This is not,  however,  an
ideal  Universe,  as  was  further  evidenced by the eye-crossing
patterns of the inlaid marble floor, and the  way  in  which  the
fronting  for  the  eighty-yard  long  marble-topped bar had been
made. The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had
been  made  by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarean
Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that  the  twenty  thousand
lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in.
 
A few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar
or  relaxing  in the richly coloured body-hugging seats that were
deployed here and there about  the  bar  area.  A  young  Vl'Hurg
officer  and  his  green  steaming  young lady passed through the
large smoked glass doors at the far  end  of  the  bar  into  the
dazzling light of the main body of the Restaurant beyond.
 
Behind Arthur was a large curtained bay window. He  pulled  aside
the  corner  of  the  curtain and looked out at a landscape which
under normal circumstances would have given Arthur  the  creeping
horrors.  These  were not, however, normal circumstances, for the
thing that froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up  his
back and off the top of his head was the sky. The sky was ...
 
An attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place.
 
"All in good time, sir," he said.
 
Zaphod's eyes flashed.
 
"Hey, hang about you dead guys," he said, "I think we're  missing
some ultra-important thing here you know. Something somebody said
and we missed it."
 
Arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he
had just seen.
 
He said, "I said it was a sort of apres ..."
 
"Yeah, and don't you wish you hadn't?" said Zaphod, "Ford?"
 
"I said it was odd."
 
"Yeah, shrewd but dull, perhaps it was ..."
 
"Perhaps," interrupted the  green  blur  who  had  by  this  time
resolved  into  the  shape  of  a small wizened dark-suited green
waiter, "perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks
..."
 
"Drinks!" cried Zaphod, "that was it! See what you  miss  if  you
don't stay alert."
 
"Indeed sir,"  said  the  waiter  patiently.  "If  the  lady  and
gentlemen would care to order drinks before dinner ..."
 
"Dinner!" Zaphod exclaimed with passion,  "Listen,  little  green
person,  my  stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night
for the mere idea."
 
"... and the Universe," concluded the waiter, determined  not  to
be  deflected  on  his home stretch, "will explode later for your
pleasure."
 
Ford's head swivelled towards him. He spoke with feeling.
 
"Wow," he said, "What sort of drinks do you serve in this place?"
 
The waiter laughed a polite little waiter's laugh.
 
"Ah," he said, "I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me."
 
"Oh, I hope not," breathed Ford.
 
The waiter coughed a polite little waiter's cough.
 
"It is not unusual for our customers to be a  little  disoriented
by the time journey," he said, "so if I might suggest ..."
 
"Time journey?" said Zaphod.
 
"Time journey?" said Ford.
 
"Time journey?" said Trillian.
 
"You mean this isn't the afterlife?" said Arthur.
 
The waiter smiled a polite little waiter's smile. He  had  almost
exhausted  his  polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be
slipping into his role of a rather  tight  lipped  and  sarcastic
little waiter.
 
"Afterlife sir?" he said, "No sir."
 
"And we're not dead?" said Arthur.
 
The waiter tightened his lips.
 
"Aha, ha," he said, "Sir is most  evidently  alive,  otherwise  I
would not attempt to serve sir."
 
In an extraordinary gesture  which  is  pointless  attempting  to
describe,  Zaphod  Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two
of his arms and one of his thighs with the other.
 
"Hey guys," he said, "This  is  crazy.  We  finally  did  it.  We
finally got to where we were going. This is Milliways!"
 
"Yes sir," said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel,
"this is Milliways - the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."
 
"End of what?" said Arthur.
 
"The  Universe,"  repeated   the   waiter,   very   clearly   and
unnecessarily distinctly.
 
"When did that end?" said Arthur.
 
"In just a few minutes, sir," said the waiter.  He  took  a  deep
breath.  He  didn't  need  to do this since his body was supplied
with the peculiar assortment of gases it  required  for  survival
from  a  small  intravenous device strapped to his leg. There are
times, however, when whatever your metabolism you have to take  a
deep breath.
 
"Now, if you would care to order drinks at  last,"  he  said,  "I
will then show you to your table."
 
Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over  to  the  bar  and
bought most of it.

Chapter 15
 
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  is  one  of  the  most
extraordinary  ventures in the entire history of catering. It has
been built on the fragmented remains of ... it will be  built  on
the fragmented ... that is to say it will have been built by this
time, and indeed has been -
 
One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not  that
of  accidentally  becoming your own father or mother. There is no
problem involved in becoming your own father  or  mother  that  a
broadminded  and  well-adjusted  family can't cope with. There is
also no problem about changing the course of history - the course
of  history  does  not change because it all fits together like a
jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things
they  were  supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the
end.
 
The major problem is quite simply one of grammar,  and  the  main
work  to  consult in this matter is Dr Dan Streetmentioner's Time
Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will  tell  you
for  instance  how to describe something that was about to happen
to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping  forward
two  days  in  order  to  avoid  it.  The event will be described
differently according to whether you are talking  about  it  from
the  standpoint  of  your  own  natural  time, from a time in the
further future, or a time in the  further  past  and  is  further
complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst
you are actually travelling from one time  to  another  with  the
intention of becoming your own father or mother.
 
Most readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified
Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up:
and in fact in later editions of the book all  the  pages  beyond
this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.
 
The Hitch Hikers Guide to the  Galaxy  skips  lightly  over  this
tangle  of  academic  abstraction,  pausing only to note that the
term "Future Perfect" has been abandoned since it was  discovered
not to be.
 
To resume:
 
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  is  one  of  the  most
extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering.
 
It is built on the fragmented remains  of  an  eventually  ruined
planet  which  is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble
and projected forward in time to the precise moment of the End of
the Universe.
 
This is, many would say, impossible.
 
In it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat
(willan on-eat) sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen)
the whole of creation explode around them.
 
This is, many would say, equally impossible.
 
You can arrive (mayan arivan on-when) for any  sitting  you  like
without  prior  (late fore-when) reservation because you can book
retrospectively, as it were when you return  to  your  own  time.
(you  can have on-book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta
retrohome.)
 
This is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible.
 
At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with  (mayan  meetan  con
with  dinan  on  when)  a fascinating cross-section of the entire
population of space and time.
 
This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible.
 
You can visit it as many times as you like  (mayan  on-visit  re-
onvisiting  ... and so on - for further tense-corrections consult
Dr Streetmentioner's book) and be sure of never meeting yourself,
because of the embarrassment this usually causes.
 
This, even if the rest were true, which  it  isn't,  is  patently
impossible, say the doubters.
 
All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings  account  in
your  own  era,  and  when  you  arrive  at  the  End of Time the
operation of compound interest means that the  fabulous  cost  of
your meal has been paid for.
 
This, many claim, is not merely impossible  but  clearly  insane,
which  is  why  the  advertising executives of the star system of
Bastablon  came  up  with  this  slogan:  "If  you've  done   six
impossible  things  this  morning,  why  not  round  it  off with
breakfast  at  Milliways,  the  Restaurant  at  the  End  of  the
Universe?"
 
=================================================================
Chapter 16
 
At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a  newt.  His
heads  knocked  together and his smiles were coming out of synch.
He was miserably happy.
 
"Zaphod," said Ford, "whilst  you're  still  capable  of  speech,
would  you  care  to tell me what the photon happened? Where have
you been? Where have we been?  Small  matter,  but  I'd  like  it
cleared up."
 
Zaphod's left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink  further
into the obscurity of drink.
 
"Yeah," he said, "I've been around. They want me to find the  man
who  rules  the Universe, but I don't care to meet him. I believe
the man can't cook."
 
His left head watched his right head saying this and then nodded.
 
"True," it said, "have another drink."
 
Ford had another Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, the drink which has
been  described  as  the  alcoholic  equivalent  of  a  mugging -
expensive and bad for  the  head.  Whatever  had  happened,  Ford
decided, he didn't really care too much.
 
"Listen Ford," said Zaphod, "everything's cool and froody."
 
"You mean everything's under control."
 
"No," said Zaphod, "I do not  mean  everything's  under  control.
That  would  not  be  cool  and  froody. If you want to know what
happened let's just say I had the whole situation in  my  pocket.
OK?"
 
Ford shrugged.
 
Zaphod giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the
glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top.
 
A wild-skinned sky-gypsy  approached  them  and  played  electric
violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed
to go away again.
 
The gypsy approached Arthur and Trillian sitting in another  part
of the bar.
 
"I don't know what this place is," said Arthur, "but I  think  it
gives me the creeps."
 
"Have another drink," said Trillian, "Enjoy yourself."
 
"Which?" said Arthur, "the two are mutually exclusive."
 
"Poor Arthur, you're not really cut out for this life are you?"
 
"You call this life?"
 
"You're beginning to sound like Marvin."
 
"Marvin's the clearest thinker I know. How do you think  we  make
this violinist go away?"
 
The waiter approached.
 
"Your table is ready," he said.
 
Seen  from  the  outside,  which  it  never  is,  the  Restaurant
resembles  a  giant  glittering  starfish  beached on a forgotten
rock. Each of  its  arms  houses  the  bars,  the  kitchens,  the
forcefield  generators which protect the entire structure and the
decayed planet on which it sits,  and  the  Time  Turbines  which
slowly  rock  the  whole affair backwards and forwards across the
crucial moment.
 
In the centre sits the gigantic golden dome,  almost  a  complete
globe,  and  it  was into this area that Zaphod, Ford, Arthur and
Trillian now passed.
 
At least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them,
and  covered every available surface. The other surfaces were not
available  because  they  were  already  encrusted  with  jewels,
precious  sea  shells  from Santraginus, gold leaf, mosaic tiles,
lizard skins and  a  million  unidentifiable  embellishments  and
decorations.  Glass glittered, silver shone, gold gleamed, Arthur
Dent goggled.
 
"Wowee," said Zaphod, "Zappo."
 
"Incredible!" breathed Arthur, "the people ... ! The  things  ...
!"
 
"The things," said Ford Prefect quietly, "are also people."
 
"The people ..." resumed Arthur, "the ... other people ..."
 
"The lights ... !" said Trillian.
 
"The tables ..." said Arthur.
 
"The clothes ... !" said Trillian.
 
The waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs.
 
"The End of the Universe is very popular," said Zaphod  threading
his  way  unsteadily  through  the throng of tables, some made of
marble, some of rich ultra-mahagony, some even of  platinum,  and
at  each  a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves
and studying menus.
 
"People like to dress up for it," continued Zaphod, "Gives  it  a
sense of occasion."
 
The tables were fanned out in a large  circle  around  a  central
stage  area where a small band were playing light music, at least
a thousand tables was Arthur's guess,  and  interspersed  amongst
them  were  swaying palms, hissing fountains, grotesque statuary,
in short all the paraphernalia common to  all  Restaurants  where
little  expense  has  been  spared to give the impression that no
expense has been spared. Arthur glanced around, half expecting to
see someone making an American Express commercial.
 
Zaphod lurched into Ford, who lurched back into Zaphod.
 
"Wowee," said Zaphod.
 
"Zappo," said Ford.
 
"My great granddaddy must have really screwed up  the  computer's
works,  you  know,"  said  Zaphod,  "I  told it to take us to the
nearest place to eat and it sends us to the End of the  Universe.
Remind me to be nice to it one day."
 
He paused.
 
"Hey, everybody's here you know. Everybody who was anybody."
 
"Was?" said Arthur.
 
"At the End of the Universe you have to  use  the  past  tense  a
lot,"  said  Zaphod,  "'cos  everything's been done you know. Hi,
guys," he called out to a nearby party of giant iguana lifeforms,
"How did you do?"
 
"Is that Zaphod Beeblebrox?" asked one iguana of another iguana.
 
"I think so," replied the second iguana.
 
"Well doesn't that just take the biscuit," said the first iguana.
 
"Funny old thing, life," said the second iguana.
 
"It's what you make of it," said the first and they  lapsed  back
into  silence.  They  were  waiting  for the greatest show in the
Universe.
 
"Hey, Zaphod," said Ford, grabbing for his arm and, on account of
the  third  Pan  Galactic  Gargle  Blaster, missing. He pointed a
swaying finger.
 
"There's an old mate of mine," he said,  "Hotblack  Desiato!  See
the man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on?"
 
Zaphod tried to follow Ford's finger with his eyes  but  it  made
him feel dizzy. Finally he saw.
 
"Oh yeah," he said, then recognition came a moment later.  "Hey,"
he said, "did that guy ever make it megabig! Wow, bigger than the
biggest thing ever. Other than me."
 
"Who's he supposed to be?" asked Trillian.
 
"Hotblack Desiato?" said Zaphod in astonishment, "you don't know?
You never heard of Disaster Area?"
 
"No," said Trillian, who hadn't.
 
"The biggest," said Ford, "loudest ..."
 
"Richest ..." suggested Zaphod.
 
"... rock band in the history of ..." he searched for the word.
 
"... history itself," said Zaphod.
 
"No," said Trillian.
 
"Zowee," said Zaphod, "here we are at the End of the Universe and
you haven't even lived yet. Did you miss out."
 
He led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time
at the table. Arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone.
 
Ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance.
 
"Hey, er, Hotblack," he called out, "how you doing? Great to  see
you  big boy, how's the noise? You're looking great, really very,
very fat and unwell. Amazing." He slapped the man on the back and
was mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response. The Pan
Galactic Gargle Blasters swirling round inside him  told  him  to
plunge on regardless.
 
"Remember the old days?" he said, "We used to  hang  out,  right?
The   Bistro  Illegal,  remember?  Slim's  Throat  Emporium?  The
Evildrome Boozarama, great days eh?"
 
Hotblack Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great
days or not. Ford was not perturbed.
 
"And when we were hungry we'd pose as public  health  inspectors,
you  remember  that?  And go around confiscating meals and drinks
right? Till we got food poisoning. Oh, and then  there  were  the
long  nights  of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above
the Cafe Lou in Gretchen Town, New Betel, and you were always  in
the  next  room  trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all
hated them. And you said you didn't care,  and  we  said  we  did
because  we  hated  them  so much." Ford's eyes were beginning to
mist over.
 
"And you said you didn't  want  to  be  a  star,"  he  continued,
wallowing  in  nostalgia,  "because you despised the star system.
And we said, Hadra and Sulijoo and me, that we didn't  think  you
had the option. And what do you do now? You buy star systems!"
 
He turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables.
 
"Here," he said, "is a man who buys star systems!"
 
Hotblack Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or  deny  this
fact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly.
 
"I think someone's drunk," muttered a purple bush-like being into
his wine glass.
 
Ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing
Hotblack Desiato.
 
"What's that number you do?" he  said,  unwisely  grabbing  at  a
bottle  for  support and tipping it over - into a nearby glass as
it happened. Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass.
 
"That really huge number," he continued, "how does it go? `Bwarm!
Bwarm!  Baderr!!'  something, and in the stage act you do it ends
up with this ship crashing right into the sun, and  you  actually
do it!"
 
Ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat
graphically. He knocked the bottle over again.
 
"Ship! Sun! Wham bang!" he  cried.  "I  mean  forget  lasers  and
stuff,  you  guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and
terrible songs."
 
His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle
on to the table. Something ought to be done about it, he thought.
 
"Hey, you want a drink?" he said.  It  began  to  sink  into  his
squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and
that the missing something was in some  way  connected  with  the
fact  that  the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit
and the silvery trilby had not yet said "Hi, Ford" or  "Great  to
see you after all this time," or in fact anything at all. More to
the point he had not yet even moved.
 
"Hotblack?" said Ford.
 
A large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and  pushed
him aside. He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to
see if he could spot the owner of  this  discourteous  hand.  The
owner  was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of
the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with  it.  In
fact  he was built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy
and with lots of solid stuffing. The suit into  which  the  man's
body  had been stuffed looked as if it's only purpose in life was
to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into
a  suit.  The face had the texture of an orange and the colour of
an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended.
 
"Kid ..." said a voice which emerged from the man's mouth  as  if
it had been having a really rough time down in his chest.
 
"Er, yeah?" said Ford conversationally. He staggered back to  his
feet  again  and was disappointed that the top of his head didn't
come further up the man's body.
 
"Beat it," said the man.
 
"Oh yeah?" said Ford, wondering how wise he was being,  "and  who
are you?"
 
The man considered this for a moment. He  wasn't  used  to  being
asked  this sort of question. Nevertheless, after a while he came
up with an answer.
 
"I'm the guy who's telling you to beat it," he said, "before  you
get it beaten for you."
 
"Now listen," said Ford nervously - he wished his head would stop
spinning,  settle down and get to grips with the situation - "Now
listen," he continued, "I am one of Hotblack's oldest friends and
..."
 
He glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn't moved so much as
an eyelash.
 
"... and ..." said Ford again, wondering what  would  be  a  good
word to say after "and".
 
The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after "and". He
said it.
 
"And I am Mr Desiato's bodyguard," it went, "and I am responsible
for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away
before it gets damaged."
 
"Now wait a minute," said Ford.
 
"No minutes!" boomed  the  bodyguard,  "no  waiting!  Mr  Desiato
speaks to no one!"
 
"Well perhaps you'd let him say what he thinks about  the  matter
himself," said Ford.
 
"He speaks to no one!" bellowed the bodyguard.
 
Ford glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to  admit
to  himself  that  the  bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his
side. There was still not the slightest  sign  of  movement,  let
alone keen interest in Ford's welfare.
 
"Why?" said Ford, "What's the matter with him?"
 
The bodyguard told him.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 17
 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a
plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally
held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy,  but  in
fact  the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers
judge that the best sound balance is usually  to  be  heard  from
within  large  concrete  bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the
stage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments  by
remote  control  from  within a heavily insulated spaceship which
stays in orbit around the planet - or more  frequently  around  a
completely different planet.
 
Their songs are on the whole very simple and  mostly  follow  the
familiar  theme  of  boy-being meets girl-being beneath a silvery
moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason.
 
Many worlds have now banned their act altogether,  sometimes  for
artistic  reasons,  but  most  commonly because the band's public
address  system  contravenes  local  strategic  arms  limitations
treaties.
 
This has not, however, stopped their earnings from  pushing  back
the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research
accountant   has   recently   been   appointed    Professor    of
Neomathematics  at  the University of Maximegalon, in recognition
of both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax
Returns,  in  which he proves that the whole fabric of the space-
time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent.
 
Ford staggered  back  to  the  table  where  Zaphod,  Arthur  and
Trillian were sitting waiting for the fun to begin.
 
"Gotta have some food," said Ford.
 
"Hi, Ford," said Zaphod, "you speak to the big noise boy?"
 
Ford waggled his head noncommittally.
 
"Hotblack? I sort of spoke to him, yeah."
 
"What'd he say?"
 
"Well, not a lot really. He's ... er ..."
 
"Yeah?"
 
"He's spending a year dead for  tax  reasons.  I've  got  to  sit
down."
 
He sat down.
 
The waiter approached.
 
"Would you like to see the menu?" he said, "or would you like  to
meet the Dish of the Day?"
 
"Huh?" said Ford.
 
"Huh?" said Arthur.
 
"Huh?" said Trillian.
 
"That's cool," said Zaphod, "we'll meet the meat."
 
In a small room in one of the arms of the  Restaurant  complex  a
tall,  thin,  gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion
looked him in the face.
 
It was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him
in  it  so  many times. It was too long for a start, the eyes too
sunken and too hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips  were  too
thin and too long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much
like a recently polished bay window.  The  hands  that  held  the
curtain  were  long  and  thin too: they were also cold. They lay
lightly along the folds of the curtain and  gave  the  impression
that if he didn't watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of
their own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner.
 
He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on
his  features went off to play somewhere more healthy. He prowled
around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening's
preying,  finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table,
where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes.
 
A bell rang.
 
He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up. His  hands
brushed  limply  over  some  of  the one million rainbow-coloured
sequins with which his jacket was  festooned,  and  he  was  gone
through the door.
 
In the Restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace,
a single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway
that led up to the centre of the stage.
 
Up the stairs bounded bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure.
He  burst  on to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone,
removed it from its stand with one swoop of his  long  thin  hand
and  stood  for  a  moment  bowing left and right to the audience
acknowledging their applause  and  displaying  to  them  his  bay
window.  He  waved to his particular friends in the audience even
though there weren't any there, and waited for  the  applause  to
die down.
 
He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not  merely
from  ear  to  ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere
confines of his face.
 
"Thank you ladies and gentlemen!" he cried, "thank you very much.
Thank you so much."
 
He eyed them with a twinkling eye.
 
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "The Universe as we know it  has
now  been  in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand
million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an
hour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the
End of the Universe!"
 
With a gesture he deftly conjured another  round  of  spontaneous
applause. With another gesture he cut it.
 
"I  am  your  host  for  tonight,"  he  said,  "my  name  is  Max
Quordlepleen  ..."  (Everybody  knew  this,  his  act  was famous
throughout the known  Galaxy,  but  he  said  it  for  the  fresh
applause  it  generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming
smile and wave.) "... and I've just come straight from  the  very
very other end of time, where I've been hosting a show at the Big
Bang Burger Bar - where I can tell you we  had  a  very  exciting
evening  ladies  and  gentlemen  -  and  I will be with you right
through this historic occasion, the End of History itself!"
 
Another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights  dimmed
down   further.   On   every  table  candles  ignited  themselves
spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all  the  diners  and
wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million
intimate shadows. A tremor of  excitement  thrilled  through  the
darkened Restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very
very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade.
 
Max's voice was hushed as he continued.
 
"So, ladies and gentlemen," he breathed, "the  candles  are  lit,
the  band  plays  softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us
fades into transparency, revealing a dark  and  sullen  sky  hung
heavy  with  the  ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see
we're all in for a fabulous evening's apocalypse!"
 
Even the soft tootling of the band faded away  as  stunned  shock
descended on all those who had not seen this sight before.
 
A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them,
 
- a hideous light,
 
- a boiling, pestilential light,
 
- a light that would have disfigured hell.
 
The Universe was coming to an end.
 
For a few  interminable  seconds  the  Restaurant  span  silently
through the raging void. Then Max spoke again.
 
"For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the  end  of
the tunnel," he said, "this is it."
 
The band struck up again.
 
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen," cried Max, "I'll be back  with
you again in just a moment, and meanwhile I leave you in the very
capable hands of Mr Reg Nullify and his  cataclysmic  Combo.  Big
hand please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys!"
 
The baleful turmoil of the skies continued.
 
Hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a  moment  or  so
normal  conversation  resumed. Max began his round of the tables,
swapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living.
 
A large dairy animal  approached  Zaphod  Beeblebrox's  table,  a
large  fat  meaty  quadruped of the bovine type with large watery
eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating
smile on its lips.
 
"Good evening," it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, "I
am  the  main  Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my
body?" It  harrumphed  and  gurgled  a  bit,  wriggled  its  hind
quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at
them.
 
Its gaze was met by looks of startled  bewilderment  from  Arthur
and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger
from Zaphod Beeblebrox.
 
"Something off  the  shoulder  perhaps?"  suggested  the  animal,
"Braised in a white wine sauce?"
 
"Er, your shoulder?" said Arthur in a horrified whisper.
 
"But naturally my shoulder, sir," mooed the  animal  contentedly,
"nobody else's is mine to offer."
 
Zaphod leapt to his feet and started  prodding  and  feeling  the
animal's shoulder appreciatively.
 
"Or the rump is very  good,"  murmured  the  animal.  "I've  been
exercising  it  and  eating  plenty of grain, so there's a lot of
good meat there." It gave  a  mellow  grunt,  gurgled  again  and
started to chew the cud. It swallowed the cud again.
 
"Or a casserole of me perhaps?" it added.
 
"You mean this animal actually wants us  to  eat  it?"  whispered
Trillian to Ford.
 
"Me?" said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes,  "I  don't  mean
anything."
 
"That's  absolutely  horrible,"  exclaimed  Arthur,   "the   most
revolting thing I've ever heard."
 
"What's the problem Earthman?" said Zaphod, now transferring  his
attention to the animal's enormous rump.
 
"I just don't want to eat an animal that's standing here inviting
me to," said Arthur, "it's heartless."
 
"Better than eating an animal that doesn't  want  to  be  eaten,"
said Zaphod.
 
"That's not the point," Arthur protested. Then he  thought  about
it  for  a  moment. "Alright," he said, "maybe it is the point. I
don't care, I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just ... er
..."
 
The Universe raged about him in its death throes.
 
"I think I'll just have a green salad," he muttered.
 
"May I urge you to consider my liver?" asked the animal, "it must
be  very  rich  and tender by now, I've been force-feeding myself
for months."
 
"A green salad," said Arthur emphatically.
 
"A green salad?" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly
at Arthur.
 
"Are you going to tell me," said Arthur, "that I  shouldn't  have
green salad?"
 
"Well," said the animal, "I know many vegetables  that  are  very
clear  on  that  point. Which is why it was eventually decided to
cut through the whole tangled problem and breed  an  animal  that
actually  wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly
and distinctly. And here I am."
 
It managed a very slight bow.
 
"Glass of water please," said Arthur.
 
"Look," said Zaphod, "we want to eat, we don't  want  to  make  a
meal  of  the  issues.  Four  rare  steaks  please, and hurry. We
haven't eaten in five hundred and  seventy-six  thousand  million
years."
 
The animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle.
 
"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good,"  it  said,
"I'll just nip off and shoot myself."
 
He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur.
 
"Don't worry, sir," he said, "I'll be very humane."
 
It waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen.
 
A matter of minutes later  the  waiter  arrived  with  four  huge
steaming  steaks.  Zaphod  and  Ford  wolfed  straight  into them
without a second's hesitation. Trillian paused, then shrugged and
started into hers.
 
Arthur stared at his feeling slightly ill.
 
"Hey, Earthman," said Zaphod with a malicious grin  on  the  face
that wasn't stuffing itself, "what's eating you?"
 
And the band played on.
 
All around the Restaurant people and things relaxed and  chatted.
The  air  was  filled  with  talk  of this and that, and with the
mingled scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and  insidious
wines.  For  an  infinite  number of miles in every direction the
universal  cataclysm  was  gathering  to  a  stupefying   climax.
Glancing at his watch, Max returned to the stage with a flourish.
 
"And now, ladies and gentlemen," he beamed, "is  everyone  having
one last wonderful time?"
 
"Yes," called out the sort of people  who  call  out  "yes"  when
comedians ask them if they're having a wonderful time.
 
"That's wonderful," enthused Max, "absolutely wonderful.  And  as
the  photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing
to tear apart the last of the red hot suns,  I  know  you're  all
going  to  settle back and enjoy with me what I know we will find
all an immensely exciting and terminal experience."
 
He paused. He caught the audience with a glittering eye.
 
"Believe me, ladies and gentlemen,"  he  said,  "there's  nothing
penultimate about this one."
 
He paused again. Tonight his timing was  immaculate.  Time  after
time  he had done this show, night after night. Not that the word
night had any meaning here at the extremity of  time.  All  there
was  was  the  endless  repetition  of  the  final moment, as the
Restaurant  rocked  slowly  forward  over  the  brink  of  time's
furthest edge - and back again. This "night" was good though, the
audience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand.  His  voice
dropped. They had to strain to hear him.
 
"This," he said, "really is the absolute end, the final  chilling
desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes
extinct. This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial `it'."
 
He dropped his voice still lower. In the stillness, a  fly  would
not have dared cleat its throat.
 
"After this,"  he  said,  "there  is  nothing.  Void.  Emptiness.
Oblivion. Absolute nothing ..."
 
His eyes glittered again - or did they twinkle?"
 
"Nothing ... except of course for the sweet trolley, and  a  fine
selection of Aldebaran liqueurs!"
 
The band gave him a musical sting. He wished  they  wouldn't,  he
didn't  need  it, not an artist of his calibre. He could play the
audience like his own musical instrument. They were laughing with
relief. He followed on.
 
"And for once," he cried cheerily, "you don't need to worry about
having  a  hangover  in  the morning - because there won't be any
more mornings!"
 
He beamed at his happy, laughing audience. He glanced up  at  the
sky,  going  through  the  same dead routine every night, but his
glance was only for a fraction of a second. He trusted it  to  do
its job, as one professional trusts another.
 
"And now," he said, strutting about the stage, "at  the  risk  of
putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here
this evening, I would like to welcome a few parties."
 
He pulled a card from his pocket.
 
"Do we have ..." he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, "Do we
have  a  party here from the Zansellquasure Flamarion Bridge Club
from beyond the Vortvoid of Qvarne? Are they here?"
 
A rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear.
He peered around trying to find them.
 
"Are they here?" he asked again, to elict a louder cheer.
 
He got it, as he always did.
 
"Ah, there they are. Well, last bids  lads  -  and  no  cheating,
remember this is a very solemn moment."
 
He lapped up the laughter.
 
"And do we also have, do we have ... a  party  of  minor  deities
from the Halls of Asgard?"
 
Away to his right came  a  rumble  of  thunder.  Lightning  arced
across  the  stage.  A  small group of hairy men with helmets sat
looking very pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to
him.
 
Hasbeens, he thought to himself.
 
"Careful with that hammer, sir," he said.
 
They did their trick with the lightning again. Max  gave  them  a
very thin lipped smile.
 
"And thirdly," he said, "thirdly a party of  Young  Conservatives
from Sirius B, are they here?"
 
A party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing  rolls  at
each  other  and started throwing rolls at the stage. They yapped
and barked unintelligibly.
 
"Yes," said Max, "well this is all your fault, you realize that?"
 
"And finally," said Max, quieting the audience down  and  putting
on  his  solemn  face,  "finally  I  believe we have with us here
tonight, a party of believers, very devout  believers,  from  the
Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon."
 
There were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of
the  floor, ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously,
and staying apart from the festivities. They blinked  resentfully
as the spotlight was turned on them.
 
"There they are," said Max, "sitting there,  patiently.  He  said
he'd  come again, and he's kept you waiting a long time, so let's
hope he's hurrying fellas, because he's only  got  eight  minutes
left!"
 
The party of  Zarquon's  followers  sat  rigid,  refusing  to  be
buffeted  by  the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over
them.
 
Max restrained his audience.
 
"No, but seriously though folks,  seriously  though,  no  offence
meant.  No,  I know we shouldn't make fun of deeply held beliefs,
so I think a big hand please for the Great Prophet Zarquon ..."
 
The audience clapped respectfully.
 
"... wherever he's got to!"
 
He blew a kiss to the  stony-faced  party  and  returned  to  the
centre of the stage.
 
He grabbed a tall stool and sat on it.
 
"It's marvellous though," he rattled on, "to see so many  of  you
here  tonight  -  no isn't it though? Yes, absolutely marvellous.
Because I know that so many of you come here time and time again,
which  I  think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final
end of everything, and then return home to your own eras ...  and
raise  families,  strive  for  new  and  better  societies, fight
terrible wars for what you know to be right ... it  really  gives
one  hope  for  the future of all lifekind. Except of course," he
waved at the blitzing turmoil above and  around  them,  "that  we
know it hasn't got one ..."
 
Arthur turned to Ford - he hadn't quite got this place worked out
in his mind.
 
"Look, surely," he said, "if the Universe is  about  to  end  ...
don't we go with it?"
 
Ford gave him a three-Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster look, in  other
words a rather unsteady one.
 
"No," he said, "look," he said, "as soon as you  come  into  this
dive you get held in this sort of amazing force-shielded temporal
warp thing. I think."
 
"Oh," said Arthur. He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup
he'd managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak.
 
"Look," said Ford, "I'll show you."
 
He grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly  with
it.
 
"Look," he said  again,  "imagine  this  napkin,  right,  as  the
temporal Universe, right? And this spoon as a transductional mode
in the matter curve ..."
 
It took him a while to say this last part, and  Arthur  hated  to
interrupt him.
 
"That's the spoon I was eating with," he said.
 
"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this spoon ..." he found  a  small
wooden spoon on a tray of relishes, "this spoon ..." but found it
rather tricky to pick up, "no, better still this fork ..."
 
"Hey would you let go of my fork?" snapped Zaphod.
 
"Alright," said Ford, "alright, alright. Why don't we say ... why
don't we say that this wine glass is the temporal Universe ..."
 
"What, the one you've just knocked on the floor?"
 
"Did I do that?"
 
"Yes."
 
"Alright," said Ford, "forget that. I mean ... I mean,  look,  do
you know - do you know how the Universe actually began for a kick
off?"
 
"Probably not," said Arthur, who wished he'd  never  embarked  on
any of this.
 
"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this. Right. You  get  this  bath.
Right. A large round bath. And it's made of ebony."
 
"Where from?" said Arthur, "Harrods was destroyed by the Vogons."
 
"Doesn't matter."
 
"So you keep saying."
 
"Listen."
 
"Alright."
 
"You get this bath, see? Imagine you've got this bath.  And  it's
ebony. And it's conical."
 
"Conical?" said Arthur, "What sort of ..."
 
"Shhh!" said Ford. "It's conical. So what you do is, you see, you
fill it with fine white sand, alright? Or sugar. Fine white sand,
and/or sugar. Anything. Doesn't matter. Sugar's  fine.  And  when
it's full, you pull the plug out ... are you listening?"
 
"I'm listening."
 
"You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls  away
you see, out of the plughole."
 
"I see."
 
"You don't see. You don't see at all. I haven't got to the clever
bit yet. You want to hear the clever bit?"
 
"Tell me the clever bit."
 
"I'll tell you the clever bit."
 
Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit
was.
 
"The clever bit," he said, "is this. You film it happening."
 
"Clever."
 
"That's not the clever bit. This is the clever  bit,  I  remember
now  that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is that you then
thread the film in the projector ... backwards!"
 
"Backwards?"
 
"Yes. Threading it backwards is definitely  the  clever  bit.  So
then,  you  just sit and watch it, and everything just appears to
spiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath. See?"
 
"And that's how the Universe began is it?" said Arthur.
 
"No," said Ford, "but it's a marvellous way to relax."
 
He reached for his wine glass.
 
"Where's my wine glass?" he said.
 
"It's on the floor."
 
"Ah."
 
Tipping back his chair to look for it,  Ford  collided  with  the
small  green  waiter  who  was  approaching  the table carrying a
portable telephone.
 
Ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because
he was extremely drunk.
 
The waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly
understood.
 
Ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug
his forelock, missed by six inches and slid under the table.
 
"Mr Zaphod Beeblebrox?" inquired the waiter.
 
"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, glancing up from his third steak.
 
"There is a phone call for you."
 
"Hey, what?"
 
"A phone call, sir."
 
"For me? Here? Hey, but who knows where I am?"
 
One of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the  food
it was still shovelling in.
 
"Excuse me if I carry on, won't you?" said his  eating  head  and
carried on.
 
There were now so many people  after  him  he'd  lost  count.  He
shouldn't  have  made  such a conspicuous entrance. Hell, why not
though, he thought. How do you know you're having fun if  there's
no one watching you have it?
 
"Maybe  someone  here  tipped  off  the  Galactic  Police,"  said
Trillian. "Everyone saw you come in."
 
"You mean they want to arrest me over the  phone?"  said  Zaphod,
"Could be. I'm a pretty dangerous dude when I'm concerned."
 
"Yeah," said a voice from under the table, "you go to  pieces  so
fast people get hit by the shrapnel."
 
"Hey, what is this, Judgment Day?" snapped Zaphod.
 
"Do we get to see that as well?" asked Arthur nervously.
 
"I'm in no hurry," muttered Zaphod, "OK, so who's the cat on  the
phone?"  He kicked Ford. "Hey get up there, kid," he said to him,
"I may need you."
 
"I am not," said the  waiter,  "personally  acquainted  with  the
metal gentlemen in question, sir ..."
 
"Metal?"
 
"Yes, sir."
 
"Did you say metal?"
 
"Yes, sir. I said that I am not personally  acquainted  with  the
metal gentleman in question ..."
 
"OK, carry on."
 
"But I am informed that he has been awaiting your  return  for  a
considerable number of millennia. It seems you left here somewhat
precipitately."
 
"Left here?" said Zaphod, "are you being strange?  We  only  just
arrived here."
 
"Indeed, sir," persisted the waiter  doggedly,  "but  before  you
arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here."
 
Zaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other.
 
"You're saying," he said, "that before we arrived here,  we  left
here?"
 
This is going to be a long night, thought the waiter.
 
"Precisely, sir," he said.
 
"Put your analyst on danger money, baby," advised Zaphod.
 
"No, wait a minute," said Ford, emerging above table level again,
"where exactly is here?"
 
"To be absolutely exact sir, it is Frogstar World B."
 
"But we just left there," protested Zaphod, "we  left  there  and
came to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."
 
"Yes, sir," said the waiter, feeling that he  was  now  into  the
home  stretch  and  running well, "the one was constructed on the
ruins of the other."
 
"Oh," said Arthur brightly, "you mean we've travelled in time but
not in space."
 
"Listen you semi-evolved simian," cut in Zaphod, "go climb a tree
will you?"
 
Arthur bristled.
 
"Go bang your heads together four-eyes," he advised Zaphod.
 
"No, no," the waiter said to Zaphod,  "your  monkey  has  got  it
right, sir."
 
Arthur stuttered in fury and said  nothing  apposite,  or  indeed
coherent.
 
"You jumped forward ... I believe five  hundred  and  seventy-six
thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place,"
explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling  that
he  had  finally  won  through  against  what  had  seemed  to be
insuperable odds.
 
"That's it!" said Zaphod, "I got it. I told the computer to  send
us  to the nearest place to eat, that's exactly what it did. Give
or take five hundred and seventy-six thousand million  years,  we
never moved. Neat."
 
They all agreed this was very neat.
 
"But who," said Zaphod, "is the cat on the phone?"
 
"Whatever happened to Marvin?" said Trillian.
 
Zaphod clapped his hands to his heads.
 
"The Paranoid Android! I left him moping about on Frogstar B."
 
"When was this?"
 
"Well, er, five hundred and seventy-six  thousand  million  years
ago I suppose," said Zaphod, "Hey, er, hand me the rap-rod, Plate
Captain."
 
The little waiter's  eyebrows  wandered  about  his  forehead  in
confusion.
 
"I beg your pardon, sir?" he said.
 
"The phone, waiter," said Zaphod, grabbing it off him. "Shee, you
guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off."
 
"Indeed, sir."
 
"Hey, Marvin, is that you?" said Zaphod into the phone, "How  you
doing, kid?"
 
There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line.
 
"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said.
 
Zaphod cupped his hands over the phone.
 
"It's Marvin," he said.
 
"Hey, Marvin," he said into the  phone  again,  "we're  having  a
great  time. Food, wine, a little personal abuse and the Universe
going foom. Where can we find you?"
 
Again the pause.
 
"You don't have to pretend to be interested in me you know," said
Marvin at last, "I know perfectly well I'm only a menial robot."
 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod, "but where are you?"
 
"`Reverse primary thrust, Marvin,' that's what they  say  to  me,
`open  airlock number three, Marvin. Marvin, can you pick up that
piece of paper?' Can I pick up that piece of paper!  Here  I  am,
brain the size of a planet and they ask me to ..."
 
"Yeah, yeah," sympathized Zaphod hardly at all.
 
"But I'm quite used to being humiliated," droned Marvin,  "I  can
even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would
you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket  of  water?  I've
got one ready. Wait a minute."
 
"Er, hey, Marvin ..." interrupted Zaphod, but it  was  too  late.
Sad little clunks and gurgles came up the line.
 
"What's he saying?" asked Trillian.
 
"Nothing," said Zaphod, "he just phoned up to wash  his  head  at
us."
 
"There," said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit,
"I hope that gave satisfaction ..."
 
"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod, "now will you please tell us where you
are?"
 
"I'm in the car park," said Marvin.
 
"The car park?" said Zaphod, "what are you doing there?"
 
"Parking cars, what else does one do in a car park?"
 
"OK, hang in there, we'll be right down."
 
In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw  down  the  phone
and wrote "Hotblack Desiato" on the bill.
 
"Come on guys," he said, "Marvin's in the car park. Let's get  on
down."
 
"What's he doing in the car park?" asked Arthur.
 
"Parking cars, what else? Dum dum."
 
"But what about the End of  the  Universe?  We'll  miss  the  big
moment."
 
"I've seen it. It's rubbish," said Zaphod, "nothing  but  a  gnab
gib."
 
"A what?"
 
"Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy."
 
Few of the other diners paid them any attention  as  they  weaved
their  way  through  the  Restaurant to the exit. Their eyes were
riveted on the horror of the skies.
 
"An interesting effect to watch for," Max was telling  them,  "is
in  the  upper  left-hand  quadrant of the sky, where if you look
very carefully you can see the star system Hastromil boiling away
into the ultra-violet. Anyone here from Hastromil?"
 
There were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere  at
the back.
 
"Well," said Max beaming cheerfully at them, "it's  too  late  to
worry about whether you left the gas on now."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 18
 
The main reception foyer was almost empty but  Ford  nevertheless
weaved his way through it.
 
Zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred  him  into  a
cubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall.
 
"What are you doing to him?" asked Arthur.
 
"Sobering him up," said Zaphod and pushed a  coin  into  a  slot.
Lights flashed, gases swirled.
 
"Hi," said Ford stepping  out  a  moment  later,  "where  are  we
going?"
 
"Down to the car park, come on."
 
"What about the personnel Time Teleports?"  said  Ford,  "Get  us
straight back to the Heart of Gold."
 
"Yeah, but I've cooled on that ship. Zarniwoop  can  have  it.  I
don't want to play his games. Let's see what we can find."
 
A  Sirius   Cybernetics   Corporation   Happy   Vertical   People
Transporter  took  them  down deep into the substrata beneath the
Restaurant. They were glad to see  it  had  been  vandalized  and
didn't try to make them happy as well as take them down.
 
At the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a  blast  of
cold stale air hit them.
 
The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long  concrete
wall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for
all of fifty major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every  car  park
in  the  Galaxy  throughout the entire history of car parks, this
car park smelt predominantly of impatience.
 
They turned a corner and found themselves  on  a  moving  catwalk
that traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the
dim distance.
 
It was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship
belonging  to  one  of  the  diners  upstairs,  some smallish and
utilitarian  mass  production   models,   others   vast   shining
limoships, the playthings of the very rich.
 
Zaphod's eyes sparkled with something that may or  may  not  have
been  avarice  as  he  passed  over them. In fact it's best to be
clear on this point - avarice is definitely what it was.
 
"There he is," said Trillian, "Marvin, down there."
 
They looked where she was pointing. Dimly they could see a  small
metal  figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner
of a giant silver suncruiser.
 
At short intervals along the  moving  catwalk,  wide  transparent
tubes  led  down  to  floor level. Zaphod stepped off the catwalk
into one and  floated  gently  downwards.  The  others  followed.
Thinking  back  to  this  later,  Arthur  Dent thought it was the
single most enjoyable experience of his travels in the Galaxy.
 
"Hey, Marvin," said Zaphod striding over towards  to  him,  "Hey,
kid, are we pleased to see you."
 
Marvin turned, and in so far as it  is  possible  for  a  totally
inert metal face to look reproachfully, this is what it did.
 
"No you're not," he said, "no one ever is."
 
"Suit yourself," said Zaphod and turned away to ogle  the  ships.
Ford went with him.
 
Only Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin.
 
"No, really we are," said Trillian and patted him in a  way  that
he  disliked  intensely,  "hanging around waiting for us all this
time."
 
"Five hundred and seventy-six thousand  million,  three  thousand
five  hundred  and  seventy-nine  years," said Marvin, "I counted
them."
 
"Well, here we are now," said Trillian, felling - quite correctly
in Marvin's view - that it was a slightly foolish thing to say.
 
"The first ten million years were the worst," said  Marvin,  "and
the  second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third
million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit
of decline."
 
He paused just long enough to make them feel they  ought  to  say
something, and then interrupted.
 
"It's the people you meet in this job that really get you  down,"
he said and paused again.
 
Trillian cleared her throat.
 
"Is that ..."
 
"The best conversation I had was over forty million  years  ago,"
continued Marvin.
 
Again the pause.
 
"Oh d ..."
 
"And that was with a coffee machine."
 
He waited.
 
"That's a ..."
 
"You don't like talking to me do  you?"  said  Marvin  in  a  low
desolate tone.
 
Trillian talked to Arthur instead.
 
Further down the chamber Ford  Prefect  had  found  something  of
which he very much liked the look, several such things in fact.
 
"Zaphod," he said in a quiet voice, "just look at some  of  these
little star trolleys ..."
 
Zaphod looked and liked.
 
The craft they were looking at  was  in  fact  pretty  small  but
extraordinary, and very much a rich kid's toy. It was not much to
look at. It resembled nothing so  much  as  a  paper  dart  about
twenty  feet  long made of thin but tough metal foil. At the rear
end was a small horizontal two-man cockpit. It had a tiny  charm-
drive  engine,  which  was  not capable of moving it at any great
speed. The thing it did have, however, was a heat-sink.
 
The heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand  billion  tons  and
was  contained  within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic
field situated half-way along the length of the  ship,  and  this
heat-sink  enabled  the  craft  to  be manoeuvred to within a few
miles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the  solar  flares
that burst out from its surface.
 
Flare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in
existence,  and  those who can dare and afford it are amongst the
most  lionized  men  in  the  Galaxy.  It  is  also   of   course
stupefyingly  dangerous  -  those who don't die riding invariably
die of sexual exhaustion at one of  the  Daedalus  Club's  Apres-
Flare parties.
 
Ford and Zaphod looked and passed on.
 
"And this baby," said Ford, "the tangerine star  buggy  with  the
black sunbusters ..."
 
Again, the star buggy was a small ship - a totally  misnamed  one
in   fact,   because   the  one  thing  it  couldn't  manage  was
interstellar distances. Basically it was a sporty  planet  hopper
dolled  up to something it wasn't. Nice lines though. They passed
on.
 
The next one was a big one and thirty yards long - a coach  built
limoship  and  obviously  designed  with one aim in mind, that of
making the beholder sick with envy. The paintwork  and  accessory
detail  clearly  said  "Not  only am I rich enough to afford this
ship, I am also rich enough not to take  it  seriously."  It  was
wonderfully hideous.
 
"Just look at  it,"  said  Zaphod,  "multi-cluster  quark  drive,
perspulex running boards. Got to be a Lazlar Lyricon custom job."
 
He examined every inch.
 
"Yes," he said,  "look,  the  infra-pink  lizard  emblem  on  the
neutrino cowling. Lazlar's trade mark. The man has no shame."
 
"I was passed by one of these  mothers  once,  out  by  the  Axel
Nebula,"  said  Ford,  "I  was going flat out and this thing just
strolled  past  me,  star  drive  hardly   ticking   over.   Just
incredible."
 
Zaphod whistled appreciatively.
 
"Ten seconds later", said Ford, "it  smashed  straight  into  the
third moon of Jaglan Beta."
 
"Yeah, right?"
 
"Amazing looking ship though. Looks like a  fish,  moves  like  a
fish, steers like a cow."
 
Ford looked round the other side.
 
"Hey, come and see," he called out, "there's a big mural  painted
on  this  side. A bursting sun - Disaster Area's trade mark. This
must be Hotblack's ship. Lucky old bugger. They do this  terrible
song  you know which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun.
Meant to be  an  amazing  spectacle.  Expensive  in  stunt  ships
though."
 
Zaphod's attention  however  was  elsewhere.  His  attention  was
riveted on the ship standing next to Hotblack Desiato's limo. His
mouths hung open.
 
"That," he said, "that ... is really bad for the eyes ..."
 
Ford looked. He too stood astonished.
 
It was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon,
twenty  yards  long,  very  clean, very sleek. There was just one
remarkable thing about it.
 
"It's so ... black!" said Ford Prefect, "you can hardly make  out
its shape ... light just seems to fall into it!"
 
Zaphod said nothing. He had simply fallen in love.
 
The blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost  impossible
to tell how close you were standing to it.
 
"Your eyes just slide off it ..." said Ford in wonder. It was  an
emotional moment. He bit his lip.
 
Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a  man  possessed  -  or
more  accurately  like  a  man  who  wanted  to possess. His hand
reached out to stroke it. His hand stopped. His hand reached  out
to stroke it again. His hand stopped again.
 
"Come and feel the surface," he said in a hushed voice.
 
Ford put his hand out to feel it. His hand stopped.
 
"You ... you can't ..." he said.
 
"See?" said Zaphod, "it's just totally frictionless. This must be
one mother of a mover ..."
 
He turned to look at Ford seriously. At least, one of  his  heads
did - the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship.
 
"What do you reckon, Ford?" he said.
 
"You mean ... er ..." Ford looked over his  shoulder.  "You  mean
stroll off with it? You think we should?"
 
"No."
 
"Nor do I."
 
"But we're going to, aren't we?"
 
"How can we not?"
 
They gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly  pulled  himself
together.
 
"We better shift soon," he said. "In a moment or so the  Universe
will  have  ended and all the Captain Creeps will be pouring down
here to find their bourge-mobiles."
 
"Zaphod," said Ford.
 
"Yeah?"
 
"How do we do it?"
 
"Simple," said Zaphod. He turned. "Marvin!" he called.
 
Slowly, laboriously, and  with  a  million  little  clanking  and
creaking  noises  that  he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned
round to answer the summons.
 
"Come on over here," said Zaphod, "We've got a job for you."
 
Marvin trudged towards them.
 
"I won't enjoy it," he said.
 
"Yes you will,"  enthused  Zaphod,  "there's  a  whole  new  life
stretching out ahead of you."
 
"Oh, not another one," groaned Marvin.
 
"Will you shut up and listen!" hissed Zaphod, "this time  there's
going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things."
 
"Sounds awful," Marvin said.
 
"Marvin! All I'm trying to ask you ..."
 
"I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?"
 
"What? Er ... yes. Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod  jumpily.  He
was keeping at least three eyes on the entrance. Time was short.
 
"Well I wish you'd just tell me rather  than  try  to  engage  my
enthusiasm," said Marvin, "because I haven't got one."
 
He walked on up to the ship, touched it,  and  a  hatchway  swung
open.
 
Ford and Zaphod stared at the opening.
 
"Don't mention it," said Marvin, "Oh,  you  didn't."  He  trudged
away again.
 
Arthur and Trillian clustered round.
 
"What's happening?" asked Arthur.
 
"Look at this," said Ford, "look at the interior of this ship."
 
"Weirder and weirder," breathed Zaphod.
 
"It's black," said Ford, "Everything in it is just totally  black
..."
 
In the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment  after
which there wouldn't be any more moments.
 
All eyes were fixed on the dome, other  than  those  of  Hotblack
Desiato's  bodyguard,  which  were  looking  intently at Hotblack
Desiato,  and  those  of  Hotblack  Desiato  himself  which   the
bodyguard had closed out of respect.
 
The bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hotblack Desiato
been  alive,  he probably would have deemed this a good moment to
lean back, or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was  not  a
man  which improved with proximity. On account of his unfortunate
condition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally inert.
 
"Mr Desiato, sir?" whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke, it
looked  as  if  the  muscles  on  either  side  of his mouth were
clambering over each other to get out of the way.
 
"Mr Desiato? Can you hear me?"
 
Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing.
 
"Hotblack?" hissed the bodyguard.
 
Again,  quite  naturally,  Hotblack  Desiato   did   not   reply.
Supernaturally, however, he did.
 
On the table in front of him a wine glass  rattled,  and  a  fork
rose  an  inch  or so and tapped against the glass. It settled on
the table again.
 
The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt.
 
"It's time we get going, Mr  Desiato,"  muttered  the  bodyguard,
"don't want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition. You
want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed. There was a  really
big  audience  for  it.  One of the best. Kakrafoon. Five-hundred
seventy-six thousand and two million years ago. Had you will have
been looking forward to it?"
 
The fork rose again, waggled in a non-committal sort of  way  and
dropped again.
 
"Ah, come on," said the  bodyguard,  "it's  going  to  have  been
great.  You  knocked 'em cold." The bodyguard would have given Dr
Dan Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack.
 
"The black ship going into the sun always gets 'em, and  the  new
one's  a  beauty.  Be  real sorry to see it go. If we get on down
there, I'll set the black ship autopilot and we'll cruise off  in
the limo. OK?"
 
The fork  tapped  once  in  agreement,  and  the  glass  of  wine
mysteriously emptied itself.
 
The  bodyguard  wheeled  Hotblack  Desiato's  chair  out  of  the
Restaurant.
 
"And now," cried Max from the centre of the  stage,  "the  moment
you've  all  been  waiting  for!" He flung his arms into the air.
Behind him, the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling
synthochords.  Max  had  argued with them about this but they had
claimed it was in their contract that that's what they would  do.
His agent would have to sort it out.
 
"The skies begin to boil!" he cried. "Nature collapses  into  the
screaming void! In twenty seconds' time, the Universe itself will
be at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!"
 
The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them - and  at  that
moment  a  still  small  trumpet  sounded  as  from  an  infinite
distance. Max's eyes swivelled round to glare at the  band.  None
of  them seemed to be playing a trumpet. Suddenly a wisp of smoke
was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him. The trumpet
was joined by more trumpets. Over five hundred times Max had done
this show, and nothing like this had  ever  happened  before.  He
drew  back  in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a
figure slowly materialized inside, the figure of an ancient  man,
bearded,  robed and wreathed in light. In his eyes were stars and
on his brow a golden crown.
 
"What's this?" whispered Max, wild-eyed, "what's happening?"
 
At the back of the Restaurant  the  stony-faced  party  from  the
Church  of  the  Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt
ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying.
 
Max blinked in amazement. He threw up his arms to the audience.
 
"A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen," he hollered, "for  the
Great Prophet Zarquon! He has come! Zarquon has come again!"
 
Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage  and
handed his microphone to the Prophet.
 
Zarquon coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering.  The
stars  in  his  eyes  blinked uneasily. He handled the microphone
with confusion.
 
"Er ..." he said, "hello. Er, look, I'm sorry  I'm  a  bit  late.
I've  had  the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up
at the last moment."
 
He seemed nervous of the expectant  awed  hush.  He  cleared  his
throat.
 
"Er, how are we for time?" he said, "have I just got a min-"
 
And so the Universe ended.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 19
 
One of the major selling point of that wholly  remarkable  travel
book,  the  Hitch  Hiker's  Guide  to  the Galaxy, apart from its
relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words Don't Panic
written   in   large  friendly  letters  on  its  cover,  is  its
compendious and occasionally accurate  glossary.  The  statistics
relating  to the geo-social nature of the Universe, for instance,
are deftly set out between pages nine  hundred  and  thirty-eight
thousand  and  twenty-four  and  nine  hundred  and  thirty-eight
thousand and twenty-six; and the simplistic style in  which  they
are  written  is  partly  explained by the fact that the editors,
having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information  off
the back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it
with a few footnoted in order  to  avoid  prosecution  under  the
incomprehensibly tortuous Galactic Copyright laws.
 
It is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the
book  backwards  in  time  through  a  temporal  warp,  and  then
successfully sued the breakfast cereal company  for  infringement
of the same laws.
 
Here is a sample:
 
The Universe - some information to help you live in it.
 
1~Area: Infinite.
 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offers this  definition  of
the word "Infinite".
 
Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some.  Much
bigger  than  that  in  fact, really amazingly immense, a totally
stunning size, "wow, that's big", time. Infinity is just  so  big
that  by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic
multiplied by colossal multiplied by  staggeringly  huge  is  the
sort of concept we're trying to get across here.
 
2~Imports: None.
 
It is impossible to import things into an  infinite  area,  there
being no outside to import things in from.
 
3~Exports: None.
 
See imports.
 
4~Population: None.
 
It is known that there are an infinite number of  worlds,  simply
because  there  is an infinite amount of space for them to be in.
However, not every one of them  is  inhabited.  Therefore,  there
must  be  a  finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number
divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes  no  odds,  so
the  average population of all the planets in the Universe can be
said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of  the
whole  Universe  is  also  zero, and that any people you may meet
from  time  to  time  are  merely  the  products  of  a  deranged
imagination.
 
5~Monetary Units: None.
 
In fact there are three  freely  convertible  currencies  in  the
Galaxy,  but none of them count. The Altairan Dollar has recently
collapsed, the Flaninian Pobble Bead  is  only  exchangeable  for
other  Flaninian  Pobble  Beads,  and the Triganic Pu has its own
very special problems. Its exchange rate of eight Ningis  to  one
Pu  is  simple  enough,  but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber
coin six thousand eight hundred miles across each  side,  no  one
has  ever  collected  enough  to  own  one  Pu.  Ningis  are  not
negotiable currency because the Galactibanks refuse  to  deal  in
fiddling  small change. From this basic premise it is very simple
to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged
imagination.
 
6~Art: None.
 
The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there
simply isn't a mirror big enough - see point one.
 
7~Sex: None.
 
Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely  because  of
the total lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that
might keep all the non-existent people of the Universe occupied.
 
However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now
because   it   really   is   terribly  complicated.  For  further
information  see  Guide  Chapters  seven,  nine,   ten,   eleven,
fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four
inclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the Guide.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 20
 
The  Restaurant  continued  existing,  but  everything  else  had
stopped.  Temporal  relastatics  held  it  and  protected it in a
nothingness that wasn't merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing  -
there was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist.
 
The force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque,  the
party  was  over,  the  diners were leaving, Zarquon had vanished
along with the rest of  the  Universe,  the  Time  Turbines  were
preparing to pull the Restaurant back across the brink of time in
readiness for the lunch sitting, and Max Quordlepleen was back in
his  small  curtained  dressing room trying to raise his agent on
the tempophone.
 
In the car park stood the black ship, closed and silent.
 
In to the car park came the late Mr Hotblack  Desiato,  propelled
along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard.
 
They descended one of the tubes. As they approached the  limoship
a  hatchway  swung  down from its side, engaged the wheels of the
wheelchair and drew it inside. The bodyguard followed, and having
seen  his  boss  safely connected up to his death-support system,
moved up to the  small  cockpit.  Here  he  operated  the  remote
control  system  which  activated the autopilot in the black ship
lying next to the limo,  thus  causing  great  relief  to  Zaphod
Beeblebrox  who  had  been trying to start the thing for over ten
minutes.
 
The black ship glided smoothly forward out of  its  bay,  turned,
and  moved  down the central causeway swiftly and quietly. At the
end it accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch
chamber and began the long journey back into the distant past.
 
The Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission,  a  passage  from
the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this:
 
The History of every major Galactic Civilization  tends  to  pass
through   three   distinct  and  recognizable  phases,  those  of
Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How,
Why and Where phases.
 
For instance, the first phase is characterized  by  the  question
"How  can  we  eat?", the second by the question "Why do we eat?"
and the third by the question, "Where shall we have lunch?"
 
The Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the
End  of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated
answer to that third question.
 
What it doesn't go on to say is that though it will usually  take
a  large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the
How, Why and Where phases, small social groupings under stressful
conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity.
 
"How are we doing?" said Arthur Dent.
 
"Badly," said Ford Prefect.
 
"Where are we going?" said Trillian.
 
"I don't know," said Zaphod Beeblebrox.
 
"Why not?" demanded Arthur Dent.
 
"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect.
 
"Basically,  what  you're  trying  to  say,"  said  Arthur  Dent,
ignoring this suggestion, "is that we're out of control."
 
The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford  and  Zaphod
tried to wrest control from the autopilot. The engined howled and
whined like tired children in a supermarket.
 
"It's the wild colour scheme that freaks me," said  Zaphod  whose
love  affair  with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into
the flight, "Every time you try to  operate  on  of  these  weird
black  controls that are labelled in black on a black background,
a little black light lights up black to let you know you've  done
it. What is this? Some kind of galactic hyperhearse?"
 
The walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the  ceiling  was
black,  the  seats  -  which  were  rudimentary  since  the  only
important trip this ship was designed  for  was  supposed  to  be
unmanned   -  were  black,  the  control  panel  was  black,  the
instruments were black, the little screws that held them in place
were  black,  the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black, and
when they had lifted up a corner of it they had  discovered  that
the foam underlay also was black.
 
"Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different
wavelengths," offered Trillian.
 
"Or didn't have much imagination," muttered Arthur.
 
"Perhaps," said Marvin, "he was feeling very depressed."
 
In fact, though they weren't to  know  it,  the  decor  had  been
chosen in honour of its owner's sad, lamented, and tax-deductible
condition.
 
The ship gave a particularly sickening lurch.
 
"Take it easy," pleaded Arthur, "you're making me space sick."
 
"Time sick,"  said  Ford,  "we're  plummeting  backwards  through
time."
 
"Thank you," said Arthur, "now I think I really am  going  to  be
ill."
 
"Go ahead," said Zaphod, "we could do with a little colour  about
this place."
 
"This is meant to be a polite after-dinner conversation  is  it?"
snapped Arthur.
 
Zaphod left the controls for Ford to figure out, and lurched over
to Arthur.
 
"Look, Earthman," he said angrily,  "you've  got  a  job  to  do,
right? The Question to the Ultimate Answer, right?"
 
"What, that thing?" said Arthur, "I thought we'd forgotten  about
that."
 
"Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it's worth a lot of  money  in
the  right quarters. And it's all locked up in that head thing of
yours."
 
"Yes but ..."
 
"But nothing! Think about it. The Meaning of  Life!  We  get  our
fingers  on  that  we  can  hold every shrink in the Galaxy up to
ransom, and that's worth a bundle. I owe mine a mint."
 
Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm.
 
"Alright," he said, "but where do we start? How  should  I  know?
They  say  the Ultimate Answer or whatever is Forty-two, how am I
supposed to know what the question is? It could  be  anything.  I
mean, what's six times seven?"
 
Zaphod looked at him hard for a moment. Then his eyes blazed with
excitement.
 
"Forty-two!" he cried.
 
Arthur wiped his palm across his forehead.
 
"Yes," he said patiently," I know that."
 
Zaphod's faces fell.
 
"I'm just saying that the question could  be  anything  at  all,"
said Arthur, "and I don't see how I am meant to know."
 
"Because," hissed Zaphod, "you were there when  your  planet  did
the big firework."
 
"We have a thing on Earth ..." began Arthur.
 
"Had," corrected Zaphod.
 
"... called tact. Oh never mind. Look, I just don't know."
 
A low voice echoed dully round the cabin.
 
"I know," said Marvin.
 
Ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a  losing
battle with.
 
"Stay out of this Marvin," he said, "this is organism talk."
 
"It's printed in the Earthman's  brainwave  patterns,"  continued
Marvin, "but I don't suppose you'll be very interested in knowing
that."
 
"You mean," said Arthur, "you mean you can see into my mind?"
 
"Yes," said Marvin.
 
Arthur stared in astonishment.
 
"And ...?" he said.
 
"It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small."
 
"Ah," said Arthur, "abuse."
 
"Yes," confirmed Marvin.
 
"Ah, ignore him," said Zaphod, "he's only making it up."
 
"Making it up?" said Marvin, swivelling his head in a  parody  of
astonishment,  "Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad
enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it."
 
"Marvin," said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she
was  still  capable  of  assuming  in talking to this misbegotten
creature, "if you knew all along, why then didn't you tell us?"
 
Marvin's head swivelled back to her.
 
"You didn't ask," he said simply.
 
"Well, we're asking you now, metal man," said Ford, turning round
to look at him.
 
At that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, the
engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum.
 
"Hey, Ford," said Zaphod, "that sounds good. Have you worked  out
the controls of this boat?"
 
"No," said Ford, "I just stopped fiddling with them. I reckon  we
just go to wherever this ship is going and get off it fast."
 
"Yeah, right," said Zaphod.
 
"I could tell you weren't really interested," murmured Marvin  to
himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off.
 
"Trouble is," said Ford, "that the one instrument in  this  while
ship  that  is giving any reading is worrying me. If it is what I
think it is, and if it's saying what I think  it's  saying,  then
we've  already  gone too far back into the past. Maybe as much as
two million years before our own time."
 
Zaphod shrugged.
 
"Time is bunk," he said.
 
"I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway," said Arthur.
 
"Me," said Zaphod.
 
"No. Who it really belongs to."
 
"Really me," insisted Zaphod, "look, property  is  theft,  right?
Therefore theft is property. Therefore this ship is mine, OK?"
 
"Tell the ship that," said Arthur.
 
Zaphod strode over to the console.
 
"Ship," he said, banging on the panels, "this is your  new  owner
speaking to ..."
 
He got no further. Several things happened at once.
 
The ship dropped out fo time travel mode and re-emerged into real
space.
 
All the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the
time trip now lit up.
 
A  large  vision  screen  above  the  console  winked  into  life
revealing a wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead
of them.
 
None of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that
Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the
rear of the cabin, as were all the others.
 
They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of  noise  that
thuddered  out  of  the  monitor  speakers surrounding the vision
screen.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 21
 
Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in  the  middle  of  the
vast  Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound
system.
 
That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the stage
technicians.  They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area's
giant control ship which hung in orbit some  four  hundred  miles
above  the surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound
system from there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker  silos
wouldn't have survived the tuning up.
 
If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of  the  speaker  silos
then  his  expiring thought would have been that in both size and
shape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan. Risen out of the
silos,  the  neutron  phase  speaker  stacks  towered monstrously
against the sky, obscuring the banks of  plutonium  reactors  and
seismic amps behind them.
 
Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers  lay
the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship,
the massive photon-ajuitar, the bass detonator and  the  Megabang
drum complex.
 
It was going to be a noisy show.
 
Aboard the giant control  ship,  all  was  activity  and  bustle.
Hotblack  Desiato's  limoship,  a  mere  tadpole  beside  it, had
arrived  and  docked,  and  the  lamented  gentleman  was   being
transported  down  the  high vaulted corridors to meet the medium
who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar
keyboard.
 
A doctor, a  logician  and  a  marine  biologist  had  also  just
arrived,  flown  in at phenomenal expense from Maximegalon to try
to reason with the lead singer who  had  locked  himself  in  the
bathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till
it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasn't a fish. The
bass  player was busy machine-gunning his bedroom and the drummer
was nowhere on board.
 
Frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on  a
beach  on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he
claimed, he had been happy over half an hour now and had found  a
small stone that would be his friend.
 
The band's manager was profoundly relieved. It meant that for the
seventeenth  time  on  this  tour  the drums would be played by a
robot and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would  be
right.
 
The sub-ether was buzzing with the communications  of  the  stage
technicians  testing  the  speaker channels, and this it was that
was being relayed to the interior of the black ship.
 
Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the  cabin,  and
listened to the voices on the monitor speakers.
 
"OK, channel nine on  power,"  said  a  voice,  "testing  channel
fifteen ..."
 
Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship.
 
"Channel fifteen AOK," said another voice.
 
A third voice cut in.
 
"The black stunt ship is now in position," it said, "it's looking
good. Gonna be a great sundive. Stage computer on line?"
 
A computer voice answered.
 
"On line," it said.
 
"Take control of the black ship."
 
"Black ship locked into trajectory programme, on standby."
 
"Testing channel twenty."
 
Zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched  frequencies  on  the
sub-ether  receiver  before  the  next mind-pulverizing noise hit
them. He stood there quivering.
 
"What," said Trillian in  a  small  quiet  voice,  "does  sundive
mean?"
 
"It means," said Marvin, "that the ship os going to dive into the
sun.  Sun  ...  Dive. It's very simple to understand. What do you
expect if you steal Hotblack Desiato's stunt ship?"
 
"How do you know ..." said Zaphod in a voice that  would  make  a
Vegan  snow  lizard feel chilly, "that this is Hotblack Desiato's
stuntship?"
 
"Simple," said Marvin, "I parked it for him."
 
"The why ... didn't ... you ... tell us!"
 
"You said you wanted excitement and  adventure  and  really  wild
things."
 
"This is awful," said Arthur unnecessarily  in  the  pause  which
followed.
 
"That's what I said," confirmed Marvin.
 
On a different frequency, the sub-ether receiver had picked up  a
public broadcast, which now echoed round the cabin.
 
"... fine weather  for  the  concert  here  this  afternoon.  I'm
standing  here in front of the stage," the reporter lied, "in the
middle of the Rudlit Desert, and with the  aid  of  hyperbinoptic
glasses  I  can  just  about  make out the huge audience cowering
there on the horizon all around me. Behind me the speaker  stacks
rise  like  a  sheer  cliff  face,  and  high above me the sun is
shining away and  doesn't  know  what's  going  to  hit  it.  The
environmentalist  lobby  do know what's going to hit it, and they
claim that the  concert  will  cause  earthquakes,  tidal  waves,
hurricanes,  irreparable  damage  to  the atmosphere, and all the
usual things that environmentalists usually go on about.
 
"But I've just had a report that  a  representative  of  Disaster
Area  met  with  the environmentalists at lunchtime, and had them
all shot, so nothing now lies in the way of ..."
 
Zaphod switched it off. He turned to Ford.
 
"You know what I'm thinking?" he said.
 
"I think so," said Ford.
 
"Tell me what you think I'm thinking."
 
"I think you're thinking it's time we get off this ship."
 
"I think you're right," said Zaphod.
 
"I think you're right," said Ford.
 
"How?" said Arthur.
 
"Quiet," said Ford and Zaphod, "we're thinking."
 
"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die."
 
"I wish you'd stop saying that," said Ford.
 
It is worth repeating at this point the theories  that  Ford  had
come  up  with,  on  his  first  encounter  with human beings, to
account for their  peculiar  habit  of  continually  stating  and
restating  the  very  very  obvious,  as it 'It's a nice day," or
"You're very tall," or "So this is it, we're going to die."
 
His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep  exercising
their lips, their mouths probably seized up.
 
After a few months of observation he had come up  with  a  second
theory,  which  was this - "If human beings don't keep exercising
their lips, their brains start working."
 
In fact, this  second  theory  is  more  literally  true  of  the
Belcebron people of Kakrafoon.
 
The  Belcebron  people  used  to  cause  great   resentment   and
insecurity  amongst  neighboring  races  by being one of the most
enlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet  civilizations  in
the Galaxy.
 
As a  punishment  for  this  behaviour,  which  was  held  to  be
offensively  self  righteous and provocative, a Galactic Tribunal
inflicted on  them  that  most  cruel  of  all  social  diseases,
telepathy.   Consequently,   in   order   to  prevent  themselves
broadcasting every slightest thought that crossed their minds  to
anyone  within  a  five  mile  radius, they now have to talk very
loudly and continuously about the weather, their little aches and
pains,  the match this afternoon and what a noisy place Kakrafoon
had suddenly become.
 
Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play
host to a Disaster Area concert.
 
The timing of the concert was critical.
 
The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in  order
to  hit  the  sun six minutes and thirty-seven seconds before the
climax of the song to which it related, so that the light of  the
solar flares had time to travel out to Kakrafoon.
 
The ship had already been diving for several minutes by the  time
that   Ford  Prefect  had  completed  his  search  of  the  other
compartments of the black ship. He burst back into the cabin.
 
The sun of Kakrafoon loomed  terrifyingly  large  on  the  vision
screen,  its  blazing  white  inferno  of  fusing hydrogen nuclei
growing moment by moment as the ship plunged  onwards,  unheeding
the  thumping and banging of Zaphod's hands on the control panel.
Arthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions  of  rabbits  on  a
night   road  who  think  that  the  best  way  of  dealing  with
approaching headlights is to stare them out.
 
Zaphod span round, wild-eyed.
 
"Ford," he said, "how many escape capsules are there?"
 
"None," said Ford.
 
Zaphod gibbered.
 
"Did you count them?" he yelled.
 
"Twice," said Ford, "did you manage to raise the  stage  crew  on
the radio?"
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, bitterly, "I said there were a  whole  bunch
of people on board, and they said to say `hi' to everybody."
 
Ford goggled.
 
"Didn't you tell them who we were?"
 
"Oh yeah. They said it was a great  honour.  That  and  something
about a restaurant bill and my executors."
 
Ford pushed Arthur aside and  leaned  forward  over  the  control
console.
 
"Does none of this function?" he said savagely.
 
"All overridden."
 
"Smash the autopilot."
 
"Find it first. Nothing connects."
 
There was a moment's cold silence.
 
Arthur was stumbling round the back  of  the  cabin.  He  stopped
suddenly.
 
"Incidentally," he said, "what does teleport mean?"
 
Another moment passed.
 
Slowly, the others turned to face him.
 
"Probably the wrong moment to ask," said  Arthur,  "It's  just  I
remember  hearing  you  use the word a short while ago and I only
bring it up because ..."
 
"Where," said Ford Prefect quietly, "does it say teleport?"
 
"Well, just over here in fact," said Arthur, pointing at  a  dark
control  box  in  the  rear  of  the  cabin, "Just under the word
`emergency', above the word `system' and beside the  sign  saying
`out of order'."
 
In the pandemonium that instantly followed, the  only  action  to
follow  was  that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the
small black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly
at the single small black button set into it.
 
A  six-foot  square  panel  slid  open  beside  it  revealing   a
compartment which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found
a new function in life as  an  electrician's  junk  store.  Half-
finished  wiring  hung  from  the  ceiling, a jumble of abandoned
components lay strewn on the floor,  and  the  programming  panel
lolled  out  of  the cavity in the wall into which it should have
been secured.
 
A junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting  the  shipyard  where
this  ship  was  being  constructed,  had demanded to know of the
works foreman  why  the  hell  they  were  fitting  an  extremely
expensive  teleport  into  a  ship  which  only had one important
journey to make, and that unmanned.  The  foreman  had  explained
that  the  teleport  was available at a ten per cent discount and
the accountant  had  explained  that  this  was  immaterial;  the
foreman  had  explained that it was the finest, most powerful and
sophisticated teleport that money could buy  and  the  accountant
had  explained that the money did not wish to buy it; the foreman
had explained that people would still need to enter and leave the
ship  and  the  accountant  had explained that the ship sported a
perfectly serviceable door; the foreman had  explained  that  the
accountant  could  go  and  boil  his head and the accountant had
explained to the foreman that the thing approaching  him  rapidly
from  his left was a knuckle sandwich. After the explanations had
been concluded, work  was  discontinued  on  the  teleport  which
subsequently  passed  unnoticed on the invoice as "Sund. explns."
at five times the price.
 
"Hell's donkeys," muttered Zaphod as he  and  Ford  attempted  to
sort through the tangle of wiring.
 
After a moment or so Ford told him to stand  back.  He  tossed  a
coin  into  the  teleport  and  jiggled  a  switch on the lolling
control panel. With  a  crackle  and  spit  of  light,  the  coin
vanished.
 
"That much of  it  works,"  said  Ford,  "however,  there  is  no
guidance  system. A matter transference teleport without guidance
programming could put you ... well, anywhere."
 
The sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen.
 
"Who cares," said Zaphod, "we go where we go."
 
"And," said Ford, "there is no autosystem. We  couldn't  all  go.
Someone would have to stay and operate it."
 
A solemn moment shuffled past. The sun loomed larger and larger.
 
"Hey, Marvin kid," said Zaphod brightly, "how you doing?"
 
"Very badly I suspect," muttered Marvin.
 
A shortish while later,  the  concert  on  Kakrafoon  reached  an
unexpected climax.
 
The black ship with its single morose  occupant  had  plunged  on
schedule  into  the  nuclear  furnace  of  the sun. Massive solar
flares licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling
and  in a few cases spilling the dozen or so Flare Riders who had
been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation  of
the moment.
 
Moments before the flare light  reached  Kakrafoon  the  pounding
desert  cracked  along  a  deep  faultline.  A  huge and hitherto
undetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed
to  the  surface  to be followed seconds later by the eruption of
millions of tons of boiling lava that  flowed  hundreds  of  feet
into the air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and
below the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side  of
the world and back again.
 
Those - very few - who witnessed the  event  and  survived  swear
that  the  whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose
into the air like a mile-thick pancake, flipped itself  over  and
fell  back  down. At that precise moment the solar radiation from
the flares filtered through the clouds  of  vaporized  water  and
struck the ground.
 
A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert  was  thick
with  flowers.  The structure of the atmosphere around the planet
was subtly altered. The sun blazed less harshly  in  the  summer,
the cold bit less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more
often,  and  slowly  the  desert  world  of  Kakrafoon  became  a
paradise.  Even  the  telepathic  power  with which the people of
Kakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the  force
of the explosion.
 
A spokesman for Disaster Area - the  one  who  had  had  all  the
environmentalists  shot  - was later quoted as saying that it had
been "a good gig".
 
Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A  few
sceptical  scientists  examined  the  records  of the events more
closely, and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a
vast  artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a
nearby region of space.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 22
 
Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it.  Hangovers  he'd  had,
but  never  anything on this scale. This was it, this was the big
one, this was the ultimate pits. Matter  transference  beams,  he
decided,  were  not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the
head.
 
Being for the moment unwilling to  move  on  account  of  a  dull
stomping  throb  he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought.
The  trouble  with  most  forms  of  transport,  he  thought,  is
basically  one of them not being worth all the bother. On Earth -
when there had been an Earth, before it was  demolished  to  make
way for a new hyperspace bypass - the problem had been with cars.
The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky  slime
from  out  of  the  ground where it had been safely hidden out of
harm's way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke  to
fill  the  air with and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed
to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from
one place to another - particularly when the place you arrived at
had probably become, as a result of this,  very  similar  to  the
place  you  had  left,  i.e.  covered with tar, full of smoke and
short of fish.
 
And what about matter transference beams? Any form  of  transport
which  involved  tearing  you  apart atom by atom, flinging those
atoms through the sub-ether, and then jamming them back  together
again  just  when  they were getting their first taste of freedom
for years had to be bad news.
 
Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent  and  had
even  gone  to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one
that used regularly to be chanted  by  huge  crowds  outside  the
Sirius   Cybernetics  Corporation  Teleport  Systems  factory  on
Happi-Werld III:
 
Aldebaran's great, OK,
 
Algol's pretty neat,
 
Betelgeuse's pretty girls,
 
Will knock you off your feet.
 
They'll do anything you like,
 
Real fast and then real slow,
 
But if you have to take me apart to get me there,
 
Then I don't want to go.
 
Singing,
 
Take me apart, take me apart,
 
What a way to roam,
 
And if you have to take me apart to get me there,
 
I'd rather stay at home.
 
Sirius is paved with gold
 
So I've heard it said
 
By nuts who then go on to say
 
"See Tau before you're dead."
 
I'll gladly take the high road
 
Or even take the low,
 
But if you have to take me apart to get me there,
 
Then I, for one, won't go.
 
Singing,
 
Take me apart, take me apart, You must be off your head,
 
And if you try to take me apart to get me there,
 
I'll stay right here in bed.
 
 
I teleported home one night,
 
With Ron and Sid and Meg,
 
Ron stole Meggie's heart away,
 
And I got Sidney's leg.
 
Arthur felt the waves of pain  slowly  receding,  though  he  was
still aware of a dull stomping throb. Slowly, carefully, he stood
up.
 
"Can you hear a dull stomping throb?" said Ford Prefect.
 
Arthur span round  and  wobbled  uncertainly.  Ford  Prefect  was
approaching looking red eyed and pasty.
 
"Where are we?" gasped Arthur.
 
Ford looked around. They were standing in a long curving corridor
which  stretched out of sight in both directions. The outer steel
wall - which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which
they  use  in  schools,  hospitals and mental asylums to keep the
inmates subdued - curved over the tops of their  heads  where  it
met  the inner perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered
in dark brown hessian wall weave. The floor  was  of  dark  green
ribbed rubber.
 
Ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the
outer  wall.  It was several layers deep, yet through it he could
see pinpoints of distant stars.
 
"I think we're in a spaceship of some kind," he said.
 
Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb.
 
"Trillian?" called Arthur nervously, "Zaphod?"
 
Ford shrugged.
 
"Nowhere about," he said, "I've looked. They could  be  anywhere.
An  unprogrammed  teleport  can  throw  you  light  years  in any
direction. Judging by  the  way  I  feel  I  should  think  we've
travelled a very long way indeed."
 
"How do you feel?"
 
"Bad."
 
"Do you think they're ..."
 
"Where they are, how they are, there's no way we can know and  no
way we can do anything about it. Do what I do."
 
"What?"
 
"Don't think about it."
 
Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw  the
wisdom  of  it,  tucked  it  up  and  put it away. He took a deep
breath.
 
"Footsteps!" exclaimed Ford suddenly.
 
"Where?"
 
"That noise. That stomping throb. Pounding feet. Listen!"
 
Arthur listened. The noise echoed round the corridor at them from
an  indeterminate  distance. It was the muffled sound of pounding
footsteps, and it was noticeably louder.
 
"Let's move," said Ford sharply. They both moved  -  in  opposite
directions.
 
"Not that way," said Ford, "that's where they're coming from."
 
"No it's not," said Arthur, "They're coming from that way."
 
"They're not, they're ..."
 
They both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently.
They both agreed with each other. They both set off into opposite
directions again.
 
Fear gripped them.
 
From both directions the noise was getting louder.
 
A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to
the inner wall. They ran to it and hurried along it. It was dark,
immensely long and,  as  they  passed  down  it,  gave  them  the
impression that it was getting colder and colder. Other corridors
gave off it to the left  and  right,  each  very  dark  and  each
subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed.
 
They stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the corridor
they went, the louder became the sound of pounding feet.
 
They pressed themselves back against the cold wall  and  listened
furiously.  The  cold,  the  dark and the drumming of disembodied
feet was getting to them badly. Ford shivered,  partly  with  the
cold,  but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother
used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle
high  to  an  Arcturan  Megagrasshopper:  stories  of dead ships,
haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the  obscurer  regions
of  deep  space  infested  with demons or the ghosts of forgotten
crews; stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered
such  ships;  stories  of  ...  -  then Ford remembered the brown
hessian wall weave in  the  first  corridor  and  pulled  himself
together.  However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their
death hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay  any  money  you
liked it wasn't with hessian wall weave. He grasped Arthur by the
arm.
 
"Back the way we came,"  he  said  firmly  and  they  started  to
retrace their steps.
 
A moment later they leap like startled lizards down  the  nearest
corridor  junction  as  the  owners of the drumming feet suddenly
hove into view directly in front of them.
 
Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as  about  two
dozen  overweight  men and women pounded past them in track suits
panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart  surgeon
gibber.
 
Ford Prefect stared after them.
 
"Joggers!" he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed  away  up
and down the network of corridors.
 
"Joggers?" whispered Arthur Dent.
 
"Joggers," said Ford prefect with a shrug.
 
The corridor they were concealed in was not like the  others.  It
was  very  short,  and ended at a large steel door. Ford examined
it, discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide.
 
The first thing that hit their eyes was what  appeared  to  be  a
coffin.
 
And the next four thousand nine hundred  and  ninety-nine  things
that hit their eyes were also coffins.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 23
 
The vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic. At  the  far
end,  about  three  hundred  yards away an archway let through to
what appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied.
 
Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on  to  the
floor of the vault.
 
"Wild," he said.
 
"What's so great about  dead  people?"  asked  Arthur,  nervously
stepping down after him.
 
"Dunno," said Ford, "Let's find out shall we?"
 
On  closer  inspection  the  coffins  seemed  to  be  more   like
sarcophagi.  They  stood about waist high and were constructed of
what appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly  what
it  was  -  something  that only appeared to be white marble. The
tops were semi-translucent,  and  through  them  could  dimly  be
perceived  the  features  of  their  late and presumably lamented
occupants. They were humanoid, and had clearly left the  troubles
of  whatever  world  it  was  they came from far behind them, but
beyond that little else could be discerned.
 
Rolling slowly round the  floor  between  the  sarcophagi  was  a
heavy,  oily  white  gas  which  Arthur at first thought might be
there to give the place a little atmosphere until  he  discovered
that  it also froze his ankles. The sarcophagi too were intensely
cold to the touch.
 
Ford suddenly crouched down beside  one  of  them.  He  pulled  a
corner  of  his  towel  out  of  his  satchel  and started to rub
furiously at something.
 
"Look, there's a plaque on this one,"  he  explained  to  Arthur,
"It's frosted over."
 
He rubbed the frost clear and examined the  engraved  characters.
To  Arthur  they  looked like the footprints of a spider that had
had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on  a  night
out,  but  Ford  instantly  recognized  an early form of Galactic
Eezeereed.
 
"It says `Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven,  Telephone
Sanitizer Second Class' - and a serial number."
 
"A  telephone  sanitizer?"  said  Arthur,   "a   dead   telephone
sanitizer?"
 
"Best kind."
 
"But what's he doing here?"
 
Ford peered through the top at the figure within.
 
"Not a lot," he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins  of
his  which  always  made  people think he'd been overdoing things
recently and should try to get some rest.
 
He scampered over to another sarcophagus. A moment's brisk  towel
work and he announced:
 
"This one's a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!"
 
The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place
of an advertising account executive; the one after that contained
a second-hand car salesman, third class.
 
An inspection hatch let into the  floor  suddenly  caught  Ford's
attention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at
the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him.
 
A thought occurred to Arthur.
 
"If these are just coffins," he  said,  "Why  are  they  kept  so
cold?"
 
"Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway,"  said  Ford  tugging  the
hatchway  open.  The  gas poured down through it. "Why in fact is
anyone going to all the  trouble  and  expense  of  carting  five
thousand dead bodies through space?"
 
"Ten thousand," said Arthur,  pointing  at  the  archway  through
which the next chamber was dimly visible.
 
Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway. He looked up
again.
 
"Fifteen thousand," he said, "there's another lot down there."
 
"Fifteen million," said a voice.
 
"That's a lot," said Ford, "A lot a lot."
 
"Turn around slowly," barked the voice, "and put your  hands  up.
Any other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits."
 
"Hello?" said Ford, turning round slowly, putting  his  hands  up
and not making any other move.
 
"Why," said Arthur Dent, "isn't anyone ever pleased to see us?"
 
Standing silhouetted  in  the  doorway  through  which  they  had
entered the vault was the man who wasn't pleased to see them. His
displeasure was communicated  partly  by  the  barking  hectoring
quality  of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he
waved a long silver Kill-O-Zap gun at them. The designer  of  the
gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush. "Make
it evil," he'd been told. "Make it totally clear  that  this  gun
has  a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone
standing at the wrong end that things are going badly  for  them.
If  that  means  sticking  all  sort  of  spikes  and  prongs and
blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a  gun  for
hanging  over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it
is a gun for going out and making people miserable with."
 
Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily.
 
The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round  them.
As  he  came  into  the  light  they could see his black and gold
uniform on which the buttons were so highly  polished  that  they
shone  with  an  intensity  that  would  have made an approaching
motorist flash his lights in annoyance.
 
He gestured at the door.
 
"Out," he said. People who can supply that amount of  fire  power
don't  need  to  supply  verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out,
closely followed by the wrong end of the Kill-O-Zap gun  and  the
buttons.
 
Turning into  the  corridor  they  were  jostled  by  twenty-four
oncoming  joggers,  now  showered  and changed, who swept on past
them into the vault. Arthur turned to watch them in confusion.
 
"Move!" screamed their captor.
 
Arthur moved.
 
Ford shrugged and moved.
 
In the vault the joggers went  to  twenty-four  empty  sarcophagi
along  the  side  wall,  opened  them,  climbed in, and fell into
twenty-four dreamless sleeps.

Chapter 24
 
"Er, captain ..."
 
"Yes, Number One?"
 
"Just heard a sort of report thingy from Number Two."
 
"Oh, dear."
 
High up in the bridge of the ship, the Captain  stared  out  into
the infinite reaches of space with mild irritation. From where he
reclined beneath a wide domed bubble  he  could  see  before  and
above  them  the  vast  panorama of stars through which they were
moving - a panorama that had thinned  out  noticably  during  the
course  of  the  voyage.  Turning and looking backwards, over the
vast two-mile bulk of the ship he could see the far  denser  mass
of  stars  behind  them which seemed to form almost a solid band.
This was the view through the Galactic  centre  from  which  they
were  travelling,  and indeed had been travelling for years, at a
speed that he couldn't quite remember at the moment, but he  knew
it  was  terribly fast. It was something approaching the speed of
something or other, or was it three times the speed of  something
else? Jolly impressive anyway. He peered into the bright distance
behind the ship, looking for something. He  did  this  every  few
minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for. He didn't
let it worry him  though.  The  scientist  chaps  had  been  very
insistent  that  everything  was  going  to  be perfectly alright
providing nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their  bit
in an orderly fashion.
 
He wasn't panicking. As far as he was  concerned  everything  was
going  splendidly.  He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy
sponge. It crept back into his mind that he  was  feeling  mildly
irritated  about something. Now what was all that about? A slight
cough alerted him to the fact that the ship's first  officer  was
still standing nearby.
 
Nice chap, Number One. Not of the very  brightest,  had  the  odd
spot  of  difficulty  doing  up  his  shoe  laces, but jolly good
officer material for all that. The Captain wasn't a man to kick a
chap  when  he  was  bending over trying to do up his shoe laces,
however long it took him.  Not  like  that  ghastly  Number  Two,
strutting  about  all  over  the  place,  polishing  his buttons,
issuing reports  every  hour:  "Ship's  still  moving,  Captain."
"Still   on   course,   Captain."   "Oxygen  levels  still  being
maintained, Captain." "Give it a miss," was the  Captain's  vote.
Ah  yes,  that  was  the  thing  that had been irritating him. He
peered down at Number One.
 
"Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or  other  about  having
found some prisoners ..."
 
The Captain thought about this. Seemed pretty  unlikely  to  him,
but he wasn't one to stand in his officers' way.
 
"Well, perhaps that'll keep him happy for a bit," he said,  "He's
always wanted some."
 
Ford Prefect and  Arthur  Dent  trudged  onwards  up  the  ship's
apparently  endless  corridors.  Number  Two  marched behind them
barking the occasional order about not making any false moves  or
trying  any  funny  stuff.  They seemed to have passed at least a
mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave. Finally they reached
a large steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it.
 
They entered.
 
To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most  remarkable
thing  about  the  ship's  bridge was not the fifty foot diameter
hemispherical dome  which  covered  it,  and  through  which  the
dazzling  display of stars shone down on them: to people who have
eaten at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such  wonders
are  commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments
that crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur
this  was  exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to
look like, and  to  Ford  it  looked  thoroughly  antiquated:  it
confirmed his suspicions that Disaster Area's stuntship had taken
them back at least a million, if not two  million,  years  before
their own time.
 
No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath.
 
The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough  hewn  blue  water
crystal  and  was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside
the Maximegalon Museum  of  Diseased  Imaginings.  An  intestinal
jumble  of  plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than
decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave;  the  taps  and
shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump.
 
As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was  terribly
wrong,  and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this
that Number Two approached it.
 
"Captain, sir!" he shouted through clenched teeth -  a  difficult
trick but he'd had years during which to perfect it.
 
A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above
the rim of the monstrous bath.
 
"Ah, hello, Number  Two,"  said  the  Captain,  waving  a  cheery
sponge, "having a nice day?"
 
Number Two snapped even further to attention than he already was.
 
"I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven,
sir!" he yapped.
 
Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion.
 
"Er ... hello," they said.
 
The Captain beamed at them. So Number Two had really  found  some
prisoners. Well, good for him, thought the Captain, nice to see a
chap doing what he's best at.
 
"Oh, hello there," he said to them, "Excuse me  not  getting  up,
having  a quick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then. Look in
the fridge Number one."
 
"Certainly sir."
 
It is a curious fact, and one to which no  one  knows  quite  how
much  importance  to attach, that something like 85% of all known
worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced,  have
invented  a  drink  called  jynnan  tonnyx, or gee-N'N-T'N-ix, or
jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or  more  variations  on
the  same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same,
and vary between the Sivolvian "chinanto/mnigs" which is ordinary
water   server  at  slightly  above  room  temperature,  and  the
Gagrakackan "tzjin-anthony-ks" which  kills  cows  at  a  hundred
paces;  and  in  fact  the one common factor between all of them,
beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they  were
all  invented  and named before the worlds concerned made contact
with any other worlds.
 
What can be made of this fact? It exists in total  isolation.  As
far  as  any  theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is
right  off  the  graph,  and  yet  it  persists.  Old  structural
linguists  get  very  angry when young structural linguists go on
about it. Young structural linguists get deeply excited about  it
and  stay  up late at night convinced that they are very close to
something  of  profound  importance,  and  end  up  becoming  old
structural  linguists  before their time, getting very angry with
the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided  and
unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend
too many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs.
 
Number Two stood before  the  Captain's  bathtub  trembling  with
frustration.
 
"Don't you want to interrogate the prisoners sir?" he squealed.
 
The Captain peered at him in bemusement.
 
"Why on Golgafrincham should I want to do that?" he asked.
 
"To get information out of them, sir! To find out why  they  came
here!"
 
"Oh no, no, no," said the Captain, "I expect they just dropped in
for a quick jynnan tonnyx, don't you?"
 
"But sir, they're my prisoners! I must interrogate them!"
 
The Captain looked at them doubtfully.
 
"Oh all right," he said, "if you must. Ask them what they want to
drink."
 
A hard cold gleam came into Number Two's eyes. He advanced slowly
on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent.
 
"All right, you scum," he growled, "you  vermin  ..."  He  jabbed
Ford with the Kill-O-Zap gun.
 
"Steady on, Number Two," admonished the Captain gently.
 
"What do you want to drink!!!" Number Two screamed.
 
"Well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me," said Ford, "What
about you Arthur?"
 
Arthur blinked.
 
"What? Oh, er, yes," he said.
 
"With ice or without?" bellowed Number Two.
 
"Oh, with please," said Ford.
 
"Lemon??!!"
 
"Yes please," said Ford, "and do you have  any  of  those  little
biscuits? You know, the cheesy ones?"
 
"I'm asking  the  questions!!!!"  howled  Number  Two,  his  body
quaking with apoplectic fury.
 
"Er, Number Two ..." said the Captain softly.
 
"Sir?!"
 
"Push off, would you, there's a good chap. I'm trying to  have  a
relaxing bath."
 
Number Two's eyes narrowed and  became  what  are  known  in  the
Shouting  and  Killing  People  trade  as  cold  slits,  the idea
presumably being to give your opponent the  impression  that  you
have  lost  your  glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake.
Why this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem.
 
He advanced on the captain, his (Number Two's) mouth a thin  hard
line.  Again,  tricky  to know why this is understood as fighting
behaviour. If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal,  you
were  suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast,
you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard
line  rather  than,  as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering
fangs.
 
"May I remind you sir," hissed Number Two at the  Captain,  "that
you have now been in that bath for over three years?!" This final
shot delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to  a
corner to practise darting eye movements in the mirror.
 
The Captain squirmed in his bath. He gave  Ford  Prefect  a  lame
smile.
 
"Well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine," he said.
 
Ford slowly lowered his hands. It provoked  no  reaction.  Arthur
lowered his.
 
Treading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to  the  bath
pedestal. He patted it.
 
"Nice," he lied.
 
He wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he
grinned. It was safe.
 
"Er ..." he said to the Captain.
 
"Yes?" said the Captain.
 
"I wonder," said Ford, "could I ask you actually what your job is
in fact?"
 
A hand tapped him on the shoulder. He span round.
 
It was the first officer.
 
"Your drinks," he said.
 
"Ah, thank you," said Ford.  He  and  Arthur  took  their  jynnan
tonnyx.  Arthur  sipped  his,  and  was  surprised to discover it
tasted very like a whisky and soda.
 
"I mean, I couldn't help noticing," said Ford, also taking a sip,
"the bodies. In the hold."
 
"Bodies?" said the Captain in surprise.
 
Ford paused and thought  to  himself.  Never  take  anything  for
granted,  he  thought.  Could it be that the Captain doesn't know
he's got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship?
 
The Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be
playing with a rubber duck.
 
Ford looked around. Number Two was staring at him in the  mirror,
but  only  for  an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move.
The first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray
and smiling benignly.
 
"Bodies?" said the Captain again.
 
Ford licked his lips.
 
"Yes," he said, "All those dead telephone sanitizers and  account
executives, you know, down in the hold."
 
The Captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back  his  head  and
laughed.
 
"Oh they're not dead," he said, "Good Lord no, no they're frozen.
They're going to be revived."
 
Ford did something he very rarely did. He blinked.
 
Arthur seemed to come out of a trance.
 
"You mean you've got a hold  full  of  frozen  hairdressers?"  he
said.
 
"Oh yes," said the  Captain,  "Millions  of  them.  Hairdressers,
tired  TV  producers,  insurance  salesmen,  personnel  officers,
security  guards,   public   relations   executives,   management
consultants,  you  name  them.  We're  going  to colonize another
planet."
 
Ford wobbled very slightly.
 
"Exciting isn't it?" said the Captain.
 
"What, with that lot?" said Arthur.
 
"Ah, now don't misunderstand me," said the Captain,  "we're  just
one  of  the  ships  in the Ark Fleet. We're the `B' Ark you see.
Sorry, could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me?"
 
Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around
the bath. The Captain let out a sigh of pleasure.
 
"Thank you so much my dear fellow. Do  help  yourselves  to  more
drinks of course."
 
Ford tossed down his  drink,  took  the  bottle  from  the  first
officer's tray and refilled his glass to the top.
 
"What," he said, "is a `B' Ark?"
 
"This is," said the Captain, and swished the foamy  water  around
joyfully with the duck.
 
"Yes," said Ford, "but ..."
 
"Well what happened you see was," said the Captain, "our  planet,
the world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed."
 
"Doomed?"
 
"Oh yes. So what everyone  thought  was,  let's  pack  the  whole
population  into  some  giant  spaceships  and  go  and settle on
another planet."
 
Having told this much of  his  story,  he  settled  back  with  a
satisfied grunt.
 
"You mean a less doomed one?" promoted Arthur.
 
"What did you say dear fellow?"
 
"A less doomed planet. You were going to settle on."
 
"Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided  to  build  three
ships,  you  see, three Arks in Space, and ... I'm not boring you
am I?"
 
"No, no," said Ford firmly, "it's fascinating."
 
"You know it's  delightful,"  reflected  the  Captain,  "to  have
someone else to talk to for a change."
 
Number Two's eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then
settled  back  on  the  mirror,  like  a  pair  of  flies briefly
distracted from their favourite prey of months old meat.
 
"Trouble with a long journey like this," continued  the  Captain,
"is  that  you  end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets
terribly boring because half the time you know what you're  going
to say next."
 
"Only half the time?" asked Arthur in surprise.
 
The Captain thought for a moment.
 
"Yes, about half I'd say. Anyway - where's the soap?"  He  fished
around and found it.
 
"Yes, so anyway," he resumed, "the idea was that into  the  first
ship,  the  `A'  ship,  would  go  all the brilliant leaders, the
scientists, the great artists, you know, all the  achievers;  and
into  the third, or `C' ship, would go all the people who did the
actual work, who made things and did things, and  then  into  the
`B'  ship - that's us - would go everyone else, the middlemen you
see."
 
He smiled happily at them.
 
"And we were sent off first," he concluded, and hummed  a  little
bathing tune.
 
The little bathing tune, which had been composed for him  by  one
of  his world's most exciting and prolific jingle writer (who was
currently asleep in  hold  thirty-six  some  nine  hundred  yards
behind  them)  covered  what would otherwise have been an awkward
moment of silence.  Ford  and  Arthur  shuffled  their  feet  and
furiously avoided each other's eyes.
 
"Er ..." said Arthur after a moment, "what exactly  was  it  that
was wrong with your planet then?"
 
"Oh, it was doomed, as I said," said the Captain, "Apparently  it
was  going  to  crash  into the sun or something. Or maybe it was
that the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the  kind.
Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was."
 
"Oh," said the first officer suddenly, "I thought it was that the
planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot
piranha bees. Wasn't that it?"
 
Number Two span around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard  light  that
only comes with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in.
 
"That's not what I was told!" he hissed, "My  commanding  officer
told  me  that  the entire planet was in imminent danger of being
eaten by an enormous mutant star goat!"
 
"Oh really ..." said Ford Prefect.
 
"Yes! A monstrous creature from the pit  of  hell  with  scything
teeth  ten  thousand  miles  long, breath that would boil oceans,
claws that could tear continents from  their  roots,  a  thousand
eyes  that  burned  like  the sun, slavering jaws a million miles
across, a monster such as you have never ... never ... ever ..."
 
"And they made sure they  sent  you  lot  off  first  did  they?"
inquired Arthur.
 
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "well everyone said,  very  nicely  I
thought,  that it was very important for morale to feel that they
would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a  good
haircut and where the phones were clean."
 
"Oh yes," agreed Ford, "I can see that would be  very  important.
And the other ships, er ... they followed on after you did they?"
 
For a moment the Captain did not answer. He twisted round in  his
bath  and  gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards
the bright galactic centre. He squinted  into  the  inconceivable
distance.
 
"Ah. Well it's funny you should say that," he  said  and  allowed
himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, "because curiously enough
we haven't heard a peep out of them since we left five years  ago
... but they must be behind us somewhere."
 
He peered off into the distance again.
 
Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown.
 
"Unless of course," he said softly, "they were eaten by the  goat
..."
 
"Ah yes ..." said the Captain with a  slight  hesitancy  creeping
into  his  voice,  "the  goat ..." His eyes passed over the solid
shapes of the instruments and computers that  lined  the  bridge.
They  winked  away innocently at him. He stared out at the stars,
but none of them said a word. He glanced at his first and  second
officers,  but  they  seemed  lost  in  their  own thoughts for a
moment. He glanced at Ford Prefect who  raised  his  eyebrows  at
him.
 
"It's a funny thing you know," said the Captain at last, "but now
that I actually come to tell the story to someone else ... I mean
does it strike you as odd Number Two?"
 
"Errrrrrrrrrrr ..." said Number Two.
 
"Well," said Ford, "I can see that you've got  a  lot  of  things
you're going to talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you
could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet ..."
 
"Ah, well that's a little difficult you see," said  the  Captain,
"because   our  trajectory  thingy  was  preset  before  we  left
Golgafrincham, I think partly because  I'm  not  very  good  with
figures ..."
 
"You mean we're stuck here on this ship?" exclaimed Ford suddenly
losing patience with the whole charade, "When are you meant to be
reaching this planet you're meant to be colonizing?"
 
"Oh, we're nearly there I think," said the Captain,  "any  second
now.  It's  probably time I was getting out of this bath in fact.
Oh, I don't know though, why stop just when I'm enjoying it?"
 
"So we're actually going to land in a minute?"
 
"Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land  as  such,  no
... er ..."
 
"What are you talking about?" said Ford sharply.
 
"Well," said the Captain,  picking  his  way  through  the  words
carefully,  "I  think as far as I can remember we were programmed
to crash on it."
 
"Crash?" shouted Ford and Arthur.
 
"Er, yes," said the Captain, "yes, it's all part of  the  plan  I
think.  There  was  a  terribly  good reason for it which I can't
quite remember at the moment. It was something  to  with  ...  er
..."
 
Ford exploded.
 
"You're a load of useless bloody loonies!" he shouted.
 
"Ah yes, that was it," beamed the Captain, "that was the reason."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 25
 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say  about  the
planet  of  Golgafrincham:  It  is  a  planet with an ancient and
mysterious history, rich in legend, red, and  occasionally  green
with  the  blood  of those who sought in times gone by to conquer
her; a land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry
air  heady  with  the  scent of the perfumed springs that trickle
over its hot and dusty rocks  and  nourish  the  dark  and  musty
lichens   beneath;  a  land  of  fevered  brows  and  intoxicated
imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the  lichens;  a
land  also  of  cool  and  shaded thoughts amongst those who have
learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath;  a
land  also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and
of the spirit. This was its history.
 
And  in  all  this  ancient  and  mysterious  history,  the  most
mysterious  figures  of all were without doubt those of the Great
Circling Poets of Arium. These Circling Poets  used  to  live  in
remote  mountain  passes  where  they would lie in wait for small
bands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks at
them.
 
And when the travellers cried out, saying why didn't they go away
and  get  on  with writing some poems instead of pestering people
with all this rock-throwing business, they would  suddenly  stop,
and  then  break  into  one  of the seven hundred and ninety-four
great  Song  Cycles  of  Vassilian.  These  songs  were  all   of
extraordinary beauty, and even more extraordinary length, and all
fell into exactly the same pattern.
 
The first part of each song would tell how there once went  forth
from the City of Vassilian a party of five sage princes with four
horses. The princes, who are of course  brave,  noble  and  wise,
travel widely in distant lands, fought giant ogres, pursue exotic
philosophies, take tea  with  weird  gods  and  rescue  beautiful
monsters  from ravening princesses before finally announcing that
they have achieved enlightenment and that  their  wanderings  are
therefore accomplished.
 
The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of
all  their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to
walk back.
 
All this lay in the planet's remote  past.  It  was,  however,  a
descendant  of  one  of  these  eccentric  poets who invented the
spurious tales of impending doom  which  enabled  the  people  of
Golgafrincham  to  rid  themselves  of an entire useless third of
their population. The other two-thirds stayed firmly at home  and
lived  full,  rich  and  happy lives until they were all suddenly
wiped  out  by  a  virulent  disease  contracted  from  a   dirty
telephone.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 26
 
That night the ship crash-landed on to an  utterly  insignificant
little  green-blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow
sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end  of  the
Western spiral arm of the Galaxy.
 
In  the  hours  preceding  the  crash  Ford  Prefect  had  fought
furiously  but  in  vain  to unlock the controls of the ship from
their pre-ordained flight path. It had quickly become apparent to
him  that  the  ship  had  been  programmed to convey its payload
safely, in uncomfortably, to its new home but to  cripple  itself
beyond repair in the process.
 
Its  screaming,  blazing  descent  through  the  atmosphere   had
stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and
its final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp  had  left  its
crew  only  a  few  hours  of darkness during which to revive and
offload its deep-frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began  to
settle  almost  at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the
stagnant slime. Once or twice during the  night  it  was  starkly
silhouetted  against the sky as burning meteors - the detritus of
its descent - flashed across the sky.
 
In the grey pre-dawn light it let out an obscene  roaring  gurgle
and sank for ever into the stinking depths.
 
When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin  watery  light
over  a  vast  area  heaving  with  wailing  hairdressers, public
relations executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing
their way desperately to dry land.
 
A less strong minded sun would probably have gone  straight  back
down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and
after a while the influence of its warming  rays  began  to  have
some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures.
 
Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp  in
the  night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship,
but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands  and
as  the  day  wore  on  they  crawled  out  over  the surrounding
countryside, each looking for a few square feet of  solid  ground
on which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal.
 
Two figures moved further afield.
 
From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent  watched  the
horror of which they could not feel a part.
 
"Filthy dirty trick to pull," muttered Arthur.
 
Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged.
 
"An imaginative solution to a problem I'd have thought," he said.
 
"Why can't people just  learn  to  live  together  in  peace  and
harmony?" said Arthur.
 
Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh.
 
"Forty-two!" he said with a malicious grin,  "No,  doesn't  work.
Never mind."
 
Arthur looked at him as if he'd gone mad and, seeing  nothing  to
indicate  the  contrary,  realized  that  it  would  be perfectly
reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened.
 
"What do you think will happen to them  all?"  he  said  after  a
while.
 
"In an infinite Universe anything can happen," said  Ford,  "Even
survival. Strange but true."
 
A curious look came  into  his  eyes  as  they  passed  over  the
landscape  and  then  settles  again on the scene of misery below
them.
 
"I think they'll manage for a while," he said.
 
Arthur looked up sharply.
 
"Why do you say that?" he said.
 
Ford shrugged.
 
"Just a hunch," he said, and refused to be drawn to  any  further
questions.
 
"Look," he said suddenly.
 
Arthur followed his pointing finger. Down amongst  the  sprawling
masses  a figure was moving - or perhaps lurching would be a more
accurate description. He appeared to be carrying something on his
shoulder.  As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he
seemed to wave whatever the something was at them  in  a  drunken
fashion. After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a
heap.
 
Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him.
 
"Movie camera," said Ford. "Recording the historic movement."
 
"Well, I don't know about you," said Ford again after  a  moment,
"but I'm off."
 
He sat a while in silence.
 
After a while this seemed to require comment.
 
"Er, when you say you're off, what do  you  mean  exactly?"  said
Arthur.
 
"Good question," said Ford, "I'm getting total silence."
 
Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was  twiddling  with
knobs  on  a small box. Ford had already introduced this box as a
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently  and
not  pursued  the  matter. In his mind the Universe still divided
into two parts - the Earth, and everything else. The Earth having
been  demolished  to  make  way for a new hyperspace bypass meant
that this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended
to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact
with his home. Sub-Etha  Sens-O-Matics  belonged  firmly  in  the
"everything else" category.
 
"Not a sausage," said Ford, shaking the thing.
 
Sausage, thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at  the
primitive  world about him, what I wouldn't give for a good Earth
sausage.
 
"Would you believe," said Ford in exasperation, "that  there  are
no transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted
tip? Are you listening to me?"
 
"What?" said Arthur.
 
"We're in trouble," said Ford.
 
"Oh," said Arthur. This sounded like month-old news to him.
 
"Until we pick up anything on  this  machine,"  said  Ford,  "our
chances of getting off this planet are zero. It may be some freak
standing wave effect in the planet's magnetic field  -  in  which
case  we  just  travel  round  and  round  till  we  find a clear
reception area. Coming?"
 
He picked up his gear and strode off.
 
Arthur looked down the hill. The man with the  movie  camera  had
struggled  back  up  to  his feet just in time to film one of his
colleagues collapsing.
 
Arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford.

"I trust you had a pleasant meal?" said Zarniwoop to  Zaphod  and
Trillian  as  they  rematerialized  on the bridge of the starship
Heart of Gold and lay panting on the floor.
 
Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him.
 
"You," he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to  find
a chair to slump into. He found one and slumped into it.
 
"I  have  programmed  the   computer   with   the   Improbability
Coordinates  pertinent  to our journey," said Zarniwoop, "we will
arrive there very shortly. Meanwhile, why  don't  you  relax  and
prepare yourself for the meeting?"
 
Zaphod said nothing. He got up again and marched over to a  small
cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old Janx spirit. He took
a long pull at it.
 
"And when this is all done," said Zaphod  savagely,  "it's  done,
alright?  I'm  free  to go and do what the hell I like and lie on
beaches and stuff?"
 
"It depends what transpires from the meeting," said Zarniwoop.
 
"Zaphod, who is this man?" said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her
feet, "What's he doing here? Why's he on our ship?"
 
"He's a very stupid man," said Zaphod, "who wants to meet the man
who rules the Universe."
 
"Ah," said Trillian taking the bottle  from  Zaphod  and  helping
herself, "a social climber."

Chapter 28
 
The major problem - one of the  major  problems,  for  there  are
several - one of the many major problems with governing people is
that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who  manages  to  get
people to let them do it to them.
 
To summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most
want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.
To summarize the  summary:  anyone  who  is  capable  of  getting
themselves  made  President should on no account be allowed to do
the job. To summarize the summary of the summary:  people  are  a
problem.
 
And so this is the situation we find: a  succession  of  Galactic
Presidents  who  so  much  enjoy  the fun and palaver of being in
power that they very rarely notice that they're not.
 
And somewhere in the shadows behind them - who?
 
Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed
to?
 
=================================================================
Chapter 29
 
On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle  of  nowhere  in
particular - nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it
is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which  only  six
men in this galaxy have a key - it was raining.
 
It was bucketing down, and had been for hours. It beat the top of
the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped
a stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath.
 
The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated  iron  roof  of  the
small  shack  that  stood  in the middle of this patch of scrubby
land. It obliterated the small rough pathway that  led  from  the
shack  down  to  the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of
interesting shells which had been placed there.
 
The noise of the rain on the roof  of  the  shack  was  deafening
within,  but  went  largely  unnoticed  by  its  occupant,  whose
attention was otherwise engaged.
 
He was a tall shambling man with rough straw-coloured  hair  that
was damp from the leaking roof. His clothes were shabby, his back
was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed.
 
In his shack was an old  beaten-up  armchair,  an  old  scratched
table,  an old mattress, some cushions and a stove that was small
but warm.
 
There was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten  cat,  and  this
was  currently  the  focus  of  the  man's attention. He bent his
shambling form over it.
 
"Pussy, pussy, pussy," he said, "coochicoochicoochicoo ...  pussy
want his fish? Nice piece of fish ... pussy want it?"
 
The  cat  seemed  undecided  on  the  matter.  It  pawed   rather
condescendingly at the piece of fish the man was holding out, and
then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor.
 
"Pussy not eat his fish, pussy get thin and waste away, I think,"
said the man. Doubt crept into his voice.
 
"I imagine this is what will happen," he said,  "but  how  can  I
tell?"
 
He proffered the fish again.
 
"Pussy think," he said, "eat fish or not eat fish. I think it  is
better if I don't get involved." He sighed.
 
"I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so  who
am I to judge?"
 
He left the fish on the floor for the cat,  and  retired  to  his
seat.
 
"Ah, I seem to see you eating it," he said at last,  as  the  cat
exhausted  the  entertainment  possibilities of the speck of dust
and pounced on to the fish.
 
"I like it when I see you eat the fish," said the  man,  "because
in my mind you will waste away if you don't."
 
He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the  stub  of  a
pencil.  He  held one in one hand and the other in the other, and
experimented with the different ways of bringing  them  together.
He tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper,
then next to the paper. He tried wrapping  the  paper  round  the
pencil, he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the
paper and then he tried rubbing  the  sharp  end  of  the  pencil
against  the paper. It made a mark, and he was delighted with the
discovery, as he was every day. He picked  up  another  piece  of
paper  from  the table. This had a crossword on it. He studied it
briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest.
 
He tried sitting on one of his hands and  was  intrigued  by  the
feel of the bones of his hip.
 
"Fish come from far away," he said, "or so  I'm  told.  Or  so  I
imagine  I'm  told. When the men come, or when in my mind the men
come in their six black ships, do they come  in  your  mind  too?
What do you see pussy?"
 
He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with  getting  the
fish  down  as  rapidly  as  possible  than  it  was  with  these
speculations.
 
"And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What  do
their  voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they're singing
songs to you." He reflected on this, and  saw  the  flaw  in  the
supposition.
 
"Perhaps they are singing songs to you," he  said,  "and  I  just
think they're asking me questions."
 
He paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days, just  to  see
what it was like.
 
"Do you think they came today?" he said, "I do.  There's  mud  on
the  floor,  cigarettes  and whisky on the table, fish on a plate
for you and a memory  of  them  in  my  mind.  Hardly  conclusive
evidence  I  know,  but  then all evidence is circumstantial. And
look what else they've left me."
 
He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it.
 
"Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator."
 
He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to
sleep  and  the rain outside continued to pour. Eventually he put
the calculator aside.
 
"I think I must be right in thinking they ask me  questions,"  he
said,  "To  come  all that way and leave all these things for the
privilege  of  singing  songs  to  you  would  be  very   strange
behaviour. Or so it seems to me. Who can tell, who can tell."
 
From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with  a  spill
from the stove. He inhaled deeply and sat back.
 
"I think I saw another ship in the sky today," he said  at  last.
"A  big  white one. I've never seen a big white one, just the six
black ones. And the six green ones. And the others who  say  they
come  from  so far away. Never a big white one. Perhaps six small
black ones can look like one big  white  one  at  certain  times.
Perhaps  I  would  like  a  glass of whisky. Yes, that seems more
likely."
 
He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by  the
mattress.  He  poured in a measure from his whisky bottle. He sat
again.
 
"Perhaps some other people are coming to see me," he said.
 
A hundred yards away, pelted by  the  torrential  rain,  lay  the
Heart of Gold.
 
Its hatchway opened, and three  figures  emerged,  huddling  into
themselves to keep the rain off their faces.
 
"In there?" shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain.
 
"Yes," said Zarniwoop.
 
"That shack?"
 
"Yes."
 
"Weird," said Zaphod.
 
"But it's in the middle of nowhere," said Trillian, "we must have
come  to  the  wrong  place.  You  can't rule the Universe from a
shack."
 
They hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived, wet  through,
at the door. They knocked. They shivered.
 
The door opened.
 
"Hello?" said the man.
 
"Ah, excuse me," said Zarniwoop, "I have reason to believe ..."
 
"Do you rule the Universe?" said Zaphod.
 
The man smiled at him.
 
"I try not to," he said, "Are you wet?"
 
Zaphod looked at him in astonishment.
 
"Wet?" he cried, "Doesn't it look as if we're wet?"
 
"That's how it looks to me," said the  man,  "but  how  you  feel
about  it  might  be  an altogether different matter. If you feel
warmth makes you dry, you'd better come in."
 
They went in.
 
They  looked  around  the  tiny  shack,  Zarniwoop  with   slight
distaste, Trillian with interest, Zaphod with delight.
 
"Hey, er ..." said Zaphod, "what's your name?"
 
The man looked at them doubtfully.
 
"I don't know. Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very
odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name."
 
He invited Trillian to sit in the chair. He sat on  the  edge  of
the  chair, Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and Zaphod
lay on the mattress.
 
"Wowee!" said Zaphod, "the seat of power!" He tickled the cat.
 
"Listen," said Zarniwoop, "I must ask you some questions."
 
"Alright," said the man kindly, "you can sing to my  cat  if  you
like."
 
"Would he like that?" asked Zaphod.
 
"You'd better ask him," said the man.
 
"Does he talk?" said Zaphod.
 
"I have no memory of him talking," said the man, "but I  am  very
unreliable."
 
Zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket.
 
"Now," he said, "you do rule the Universe, do you?"
 
"How can I tell?" said the man.
 
Zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper.
 
"How long have you been doing this?"
 
"Ah," said the man, "this is a question about the past is it?"
 
Zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement. This wasn't  exactly  what
he had been expecting.
 
"Yes," he said.
 
"How can I tell," said the man, "that the past  isn't  a  fiction
designed  to  account  for  the  discrepancy between my immediate
physical sensations and my state of mind?"
 
Zarniwoop stared at him. The steam began to rise from his  sodden
clothes.
 
"So you answer all questions like this?" he said.
 
The man answered quickly.
 
"I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say
things. More I cannot say."
 
Zaphod laughed happily.
 
"I'll drink to that," he said and pulled out the bottle  of  Janx
spirit.  He  leaped  up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the
Universe, who took it with pleasure.
 
"Good on you, great ruler," he said, "tell it like it is."
 
"No, listen to me," said Zarniwoop, "people come to you do  they?
In ships ..."
 
"I think so," said the man. He handed the bottle to Trillian.
 
"And they ask you," said Zarniwoop, "to take decisions for  them?
About  people's lives, about worlds, about economies, about wars,
about everything going on out there in the Universe?"
 
"Out there?" said the man, "out where?"
 
"Out there!" said Zarniwoop pointing at the door.
 
"How can you tell there's  anything  out  there,"  said  the  man
politely, "the door's closed."
 
The rain continued to pound the roof. Inside  the  shack  it  was
warm.
 
"But  you  know  there's  a  whole  Universe  out  there!"  cried
Zarniwoop.  "You can't dodge your responsibilities by saying they
don't exist!"
 
The ruler of  the  Universe  thought  for  a  long  while  whilst
Zarniwoop quivered with anger.
 
"You're very sure of your facts," he said at  last,  "I  couldn't
trust  the thinking of a man who takes the Universe - if there is
one - for granted."
 
Zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent.
 
"I only decide about my Universe," continued the man quietly. "My
Universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay."
 
"But don't you believe in anything?"
 
The man shrugged and picked up his cat.
 
"I don't understand what you mean," he said.
 
"You don't understand that what you decide in this shack of yours
affects  the  lives  and fates of millions of people? This is all
monstrously wrong!"
 
"I don't know. I've never met all these people you speak of.  And
neither,  I  suspect, have you. They only exist in words we hear.
It is folly to say you know what is happening  to  other  people.
Only  they  know, if they exist. They have their own Universes of
their own eyes and ears."
 
Trillian said:
 
"I think I'm just popping outside for a moment."
 
She left and walked into the rain.
 
"Do you believe other people exist?" insisted Zarniwoop.
 
"I have no opinion. How can I say?"
 
"I'd better see what's up with Trillian," said Zaphod and slipped
out.
 
Outside, he said to her:
 
"I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?"
 
"Very good," said Trillian. They walked off into the rain.
 
Inside, Zarniwoop continued.
 
"But don't you understand that people live or die on your word?"
 
The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he
heard  the faint sound of the ship's engines starting he spoke to
cover it.
 
"It's nothing to do with me," he said, "I am  not  involved  with
people. The Lord knows I am not a cruel man."
 
"Ah!" barked Zarniwoop, "you  say  `The  Lord'.  You  believe  in
something!"
 
"My cat," said the man benignly, picking it up and  stroking  it,
"I call him The Lord. I am kind to him."
 
"Alright," said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, "How  do  you
know  he  exists?  How  do  you  know he knows you to be kind, or
enjoys what he thinks of as your kindness?"
 
"I don't," said the man with a smile, "I have no idea. It  merely
pleases  me  to  behave  in a certain way to what appears to be a
cat. Do you behave any differently? Please, I think I am tired."
 
Zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about.
 
"Where are the other two?" he said suddenly.
 
"What other two?" said the ruler of the Universe,  settling  back
into his chair and refilling his whisky glass.
 
"Beeblebrox and the girl! The two who were here!"
 
"I remember no one. The past is a fiction to account for ..."
 
"Stuff it," snapped Zarniwoop and ran out into  the  rain.  There
was  no  ship.  The rain continued to churn the mud. There was no
sign to show where the ship had been. He hollered into the  rain.
He turned and ran back to the shack and found it locked.
 
The ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in  his  chair.  After  a
while  he  played  with  the  pencil  and the paper again and was
delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the  one  on
the  other.  Various noises continued outside, but he didn't know
whether they were real or not. He then talked to his table for  a
week to see how it would react.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 30
 
The stars came out that night, dazzling in their  brilliance  and
clarity.  Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any
means of judging and finally stopped to rest. The night was  cool
and  balmy,  the  air  pure,  the  Sub-Etha  Sens.O.Matic totally
silent.
 
A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical  calm  which
combined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter
of insects and the brilliant light of the stars to  soothe  their
jangled spirits. Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than
he could count on a long afternoon, was moved to wonder  if  this
was  the  most  beautiful he had ever seen. All that day they had
passed through rolling green hills and  valleys,  richly  covered
with grasses, wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees,
the sun had warmed them, light breezes had kept  them  cool,  and
Ford  Prefect  had  checked his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic at less and
less  frequent  intervals,  and  had  exhibited  less  and   less
annoyance  at its continued silence. He was beginning to think he
liked it here.
 
Cool though the night air was they slept soundly and  comfortably
in  the  open  and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall
feeling refreshed but hungry. Ford had stuffed some  small  rolls
into  his  satchel  at  Milliways  and they breakfasted off those
before moving on.
 
So far they had wandered purely at random, but  now  they  struck
out  firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore
this world they should have some clear idea  of  where  they  had
come from and where they were going.
 
Shortly before noon they had  their  first  indication  that  the
world  they  had  landed  on  was  not an uninhabited one: a half
glimpsed face amongst the trees, watching them.  It  vanished  at
the  moment  they  both saw it, but the image they were both left
with was of a humanoid creature, curious  to  see  them  but  not
alarmed.  Half an hour later they glimpsed another such face, and
ten minutes after that another.
 
A minute later they stumbled into a  wide  clearing  and  stopped
short.
 
Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of  about
two  dozen  men and women. They stood still and quiet facing Ford
and Arthur. Around some of the women huddled some small  children
and  behind  the  group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings
made of mud and branches.
 
Ford and Arthur held their breath.
 
The tallest of the men stood a little over five feet  high,  they
all  stooped  forward  slightly,  had  longish  arms  and  lowish
foreheads, and clear bright eyes with which they stared  intently
at the strangers.
 
Seeing that they carried no weapons  and  made  no  move  towards
them, Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly.
 
For a while the two groups simply stared at each  other,  neither
side   making  any  move.  The  natives  seemed  puzzled  by  the
intruders, and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were
quite clearly not issuing any invitations.
 
For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen.
 
After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened.
 
"Hello," he said.
 
The women drew their children slightly closer to them.
 
The men made hardly any discernible  move  and  yet  their  whole
disposition  made it clear that the greeting was not welcome - it
was not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome.
 
One of the men, who had been standing  slightly  forward  of  the
rest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader,
stepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene.
 
"Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh," he said quietly.
 
This caught Arthur by surprise. He had grown so used to receiving
an  instantaneous  and  unconscious  translation of everything he
heard via the Babel Fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased  to
be  aware  of it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by
the fact that it didn't seem to  be  working.  Vague  shadows  of
meaning  had  flickered  at  the  back of his mind, but there was
nothing he could get any firm grasp on. He guessed, correctly  as
it happens, that these people had as yet evolved no more than the
barest rudiments  of  language,  and  that  the  Babel  Fish  was
therefore  powerless  to  help.  He  glanced  at  Ford,  who  was
infinitely more experienced in these matters.
 
"I think," said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, "he's asking
us if we'd mind walking on round the edge of the village."
 
A moment later, a gesture from the man-creature seemed to confirm
this.
 
"Ruurgggghhhh  urrgggh;  urgh  urgh  (uh  ruh)   rruurruuh   ug,"
continued the man-creature.
 
"The general gist," said Ford, "as far as I can make out, is that
we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if
we would walk round his village rather than through it  it  would
make them all very happy."
 
"So what do we do?"
 
"I think we make them happy," said Ford.
 
Slowly and watchfully they walked  round  the  perimeter  of  the
clearing.  This  seemed to go down very well with the natives who
bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business.
 
Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood.  A  few
hundred  yards  past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small
pile  of  fruit  lying  in  their  path  -  berries  that  looked
remarkably  like  raspberries  and blackberries, and pulpy, green
skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears.
 
So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries  they  had
seen, though the trees and bushed were laden with them.
 
"Look at it this way," Ford Prefect had said, "fruit and  berries
on  strange  planets  either  make  you  live  or  make  you die.
Therefore the point at which to start toying with  them  is  when
you're  going  to  die if you don't. That way you stay ahead. The
secret of healthy hitch-hiking is to eat junk food."
 
They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It
looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger.
 
"Look at it this way," said Ford, "er ..."
 
"Yes?" said Arthur.
 
"I'm trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get
to eat it," said Ford.
 
The leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the  pulp  skins  of  the  things
which looked like pears. The things which looked like raspberries
and strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur  had  ever
seen, even in ice cream commercials.
 
"Why don't we eat them and think about it afterwards?" he said.
 
"Maybe that's what they want us to do."
 
"Alright, look at it this way ..."
 
"Sounds good so far."
 
"It's there for us to eat. Either it's good or it's  bad,  either
they  want  to  feed us or to poison us. If it's poisonous and we
don't eat it they'll just attack us some other way. If  we  don't
eat, we lose out either way."
 
"I like the way you're thinking," said Ford, "Now eat one."
 
Hesitantly, Arthur picked up one of those things that looked like
pears.
 
"I always thought that about the  Garden  of  Eden  story,"  said
Ford.
 
"Eh?"
 
"Garden of Eden. Tree. Apple. That bit, remember?"
 
"Yes of course I do."
 
"Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and
says do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple. Surprise
surprise, they eat it  and  he  leaps  out  from  behind  a  bush
shouting  `Gotcha'.  It wouldn't have made any difference if they
hadn't eaten it."
 
"Why not?"
 
"Because if you're dealing with somebody  who  has  the  sort  of
mentality  which  likes  leaving hats on the pavement with bricks
under them you know perfectly well they won't  give  up.  They'll
get you in the end."
 
"What are you talking about?"
 
"Never mind, eat the fruit."
 
"You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden."
 
"Eat the fruit."
 
"Sounds quite like it too."
 
Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear.
 
"It's a pear," he said.
 
A few moments later, when they had eaten the  lot,  Ford  Prefect
turned round and called out.
 
"Thank you. Thank you very much," he called, "you're very kind."
 
They went on their way.
 
For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they  kept  on
finding  the  occasional  gift  of fruit lying in their path, and
though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of  a  native  man-
creature amongst the trees, they never again made direct contact.
They decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear
that they were grateful simply to be left alone.
 
The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was
where the sea started.
 
Having no pressing calls on their time  they  built  a  raft  and
crossed  the  sea. It was reasonably calm, only about sixty miles
wide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing,  landing  in  a
country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left.
 
Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a  while  at  least
they  were  able  to  cope  with  the problems of aimlessness and
isolation by deciding  to  ignore  them.  When  the  craving  for
company  became  too  great they would know where to find it, but
for the moment they were happy to feel  that  the  Golgafrinchans
were hundreds of miles behind them.
 
Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic
more often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was
so faint and from such enormous distance that  it  depressed  him
more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken.
 
On a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling  they
came to another sea, built another raft and crossed it. This time
it was harder going,  the  climate  was  getting  colder.  Arthur
suspected  a streak of masochism in Ford Prefect - the increasing
difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense  of  purpose
that was otherwise lacking. He strode onwards relentlessly.
 
Their journey northwards  brought  them  into  steep  mountainous
terrain  of breathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast, jagged, snow
covered peaks ravished their senses. The cold began to bite  into
their bones.
 
They wrapped themselves in  animal  skins  and  furs  which  Ford
Prefect  acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of
ex-Pralite monks running a Mind-Surfing resort in  the  Hills  of
Hunian.
 
The galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all  on  the  make,
because the mental control techniques the Order have evolved as a
form of devotional discipline are,  frankly,  sensational  -  and
extraordinary  numbers  of  monks leave the Order just after they
have finished their devotional training and just before they take
their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest
of their lives.
 
Ford's technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a
while and smiling.
 
After a while an animal - a deer perhaps - would appear from  out
of  the  trees  and  watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to
smile at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he  would  seem
to radiate a deep and universal love, a love which reached out to
embrace all of creation. A wonderful quietness would  descend  on
the  surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from
this transfigured man. Slowly the deer would  approach,  step  by
step,  until  it  was almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect
would reach out to it and break its neck.
 
"Pheromone control," he said it was, "you just have to  know  how
to generate the right smell."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 31
 
A few days after landing in this  mountainous  land  they  hit  a
coastline  which swept diagonally before them from the south-west
to the north-east,  a  coastline  of  monumental  grandeur:  deep
majestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice - fjords.
 
For two further days they scrambled and climbed  over  the  rocks
and glaciers, awe-struck with beauty.
 
"Arthur!" yelled Ford suddenly.
 
It was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting  on  a
high rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the
craggy promontories.
 
"Arthur!" yelled Ford again.
 
Arthur looked to  where  Ford's  voice  had  come  from,  carried
faintly in the wind.
 
Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur  found  him  there
crouching  by  the  solid  wall  of  blue  ice. He was tense with
excitement - his eyes darted up to meet Arthur's.
 
"Look," he said, "look!"
 
Arthur looked. He saw the solid wall of blue ice.
 
"Yes," he said, "it's a glacier. I've already seen it."
 
"No," said Ford, "you've looked  at  it,  you  haven't  seen  it.
Look!"
 
Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice.
 
Arthur peered - he saw nothing but vague shadows.
 
"Move back from it," insisted Ford, "look again."
 
Arthur moved back and looked again.
 
"No," he said, and shrugged. "What am I supposed  to  be  looking
for?"
 
And suddenly he saw it.
 
"You see it?"
 
He saw it.
 
His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it  hadn't  got
anything  to say yet and shut it again. His brain then started to
contend with the problem of what  his  eyes  told  it  they  were
looking  at,  but  in  doing so relinquished control of the mouth
which promptly fell open again. Once more gathering up  the  jaw,
his  brain  lost  control  of  his  left hand which then wandered
around in an aimless fashion. For a second or so the brain  tried
to  catch  the  left  hand  without  letting  go of the mouth and
simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in  the  ice,
which  is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully
to the ground.
 
The thing that had been causing  all  this  neural  upset  was  a
network  of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the
surface. Looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the
solid  shapes of letters from an alien alphabet, each about three
feet  high;  and  for  those,  like  Arthur,  who  couldn't  read
Magrathean  there  was  above  the  letters the outline of a face
hanging in the ice.
 
It was an old face, thin  and  distinguished,  careworn  but  not
unkind.
 
It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the
coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 32
 
A thin whine filled the air. It whirled and  howled  through  the
trees  upsetting  the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust.
The noise danced and skittered round the clearing. It whooped, it
rasped, it generally offended.
 
The  Captain,  however,  regarded  the  lone  bagpiper  with   an
indulgent  eye. Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once
he had got over  the  loss  of  his  gorgeous  bath  during  that
unpleasantness  in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to
find his new life remarkably congenial. A hollow had been scooped
out  of  a  large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing,
and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants  sloshed  water
over  him.  Not particularly warm water, it must be said, as they
hadn't yet worked out a way of heating it. Never mind, that would
come,  and  in  the  meantime  search  parties  were scouring the
countryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably  one  in  a
nice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine - perfection. To
those who said that they had  a  feeling  soap  wasn't  found  in
mines,  the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was
because no one had looked hard enough, and this  possibility  had
been reluctantly acknowledged.
 
No, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about  it  was
that  when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en
suite,  and  when  in  the  fullness  of  time   the   cry   came
reverberating  across  the  hills  that  the  soap  mine had been
located and was producing five hundred cakes a day  it  would  be
more pleasant still. It was very important to have things to look
forward to.
 
Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the  bagpipes,
increasing  the  Captain's  already  considerable pleasure at the
thought that any moment now they might stop. That  was  something
he looked forward to as well.
 
What else was pleasant, he asked himself? Well, so  many  things:
the  red  and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching;
the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a
couple  of  hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing
art director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six
shiny  telephones  lined up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath.
The only thing nicer than a phone that didn't ring all  the  time
(or  indeed  at all) was six phones that didn't ring all the time
(or indeed at all).
 
Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of  people
slowly  assembling  in  the  clearing  around  him  to  watch the
afternoon committee meeting.
 
The Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on  the  beak.  The
afternoon committee meetings were his favourite.
 
Other eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree  on  the
edge  of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from
foreign climes. After his six  month  journey  he  was  lean  and
healthy,  his  eyes  gleamed,  he  wore a reindeer-skin coat; his
beard was as thick and his face  as  bronzed  as  a  country-rock
singer's.
 
He and Arthur Dent  had  been  watching  the  Golgafrinchans  for
almost a week now, and Ford had decided to stir things up a bit.
 
The clearing was now full. Hundreds  of  men  and  women  lounged
around,  chatting,  eating  fruit,  playing  cards  and generally
having a fairly relaxed time of it. Their track  suits  were  now
all  dirty  and  even  torn, but they all had immaculately styled
hair. Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their
track  suits  full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be
some form of insulation against the coming  winter.  Ford's  eyes
narrowed. They couldn't be interested in botany of a sudden could
they?
 
In the middle of these  speculations  the  Captain's  voice  rose
above the hubbub.
 
"Alright," he said, "I'd like to call this meeting to  some  sort
of  order  if  that's  at  all  possible.  Is  that  alright with
everybody?" He smiled genially. "In a  minute.  When  you're  all
ready."
 
The talking gradually died away and  the  clearing  fell  silent,
except  for  the  bagpiper  who  seemed  to  be  in some wild and
uninhabitable musical world of his own. A few  of  those  in  his
immediate  vicinity  threw  some  leaves to him. If there was any
reason for this then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment.
 
A small group of people had clustered round the Captain  and  one
of  them  was clearly beginning to speak. He did this by standing
up, clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance  as
if  to  signify  to  the  crowd  that  he would be with them in a
minute.
 
The crowd of course were riveted and all  turned  their  eyes  on
him.
 
A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be  the  right
dramatic moment to make his entry. The man turned to speak.
 
Ford dropped down out of the tree.
 
"Hi there," he said.
 
The crowd swivelled round.
 
"Ah my dear fellow," called out the Captain, "Got any matches  on
you? Or a lighter? Anything like that?"
 
"No," said Ford, sounding a little deflated. It wasn't what  he'd
prepared.  He  decided  he'd  better  be a little stronger on the
subject.
 
"No I haven't," he continued, "No matches. Instead  I  bring  you
news ..."
 
"Pity," said the Captain, "We've all run out you see. Haven't had
a hot bath in weeks."
 
Ford refused to be headed off.
 
"I bring you news," he said, "of a discovery that might  interest
you."
 
"Is it on the agenda?" snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted.
 
Ford smiled a broad country-rock singer smile.
 
"Now, come on," he said.
 
"Well I'm sorry," said  the  man  huffily,  "but  speaking  as  a
management  consultant  of many years' standing, I must insist on
the importance of observing the committee structure."
 
Ford looked round the crowd.
 
"He's mad you know," he said, "this is a prehistoric planet."
 
"Address the chair!" snapped the management consultant.
 
"There isn't chair," explained Ford, "there's only a rock."
 
The management consultant decided that  testiness  was  what  the
situation now called for.
 
"Well, call it a chair," he said testily.
 
"Why not call it a rock?" asked Ford.
 
"You  obviously  have  no  conception,"   said   the   management
consultant,  not  abandoning  testiness  in  favour  of  good old
fashioned hauteur, "of modern business methods."
 
"And you have no conception of where you are," said Ford.
 
A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it.
 
"Shut up, you two," she said, "I want to table a motion."
 
"You mean boulder a motion," tittered a hairdresser.
 
"Order, order!" yapped the management consultant.
 
"Alright," said Ford, "let's see how you are doing."  He  plonked
himself  down  on  the  ground  to see how long he could keep his
temper.
 
The Captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise.
 
"I would like to call to order," he said  pleasantly,  "the  five
hundred  and  seventy-third meeting of the colonization committee
of Fintlewoodlewix ..."
 
Ten seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again.
 
"This is futile," he exclaimed, "five hundred  and  seventy-three
committee meetings and you haven't even discovered fire yet!"
 
"If you would care," said the girl with the strident  voice,  "to
examine the agenda sheet ..."
 
"Agenda rock," trilled the hairdresser happily.
 
"Thank you, I've made that point," muttered Ford.
 
"... you ... will ... see ..." continued the girl  firmly,  "that
we  are  having  a report from the hairdressers' Fire Development
Sub-Committee today."
 
"Oh ... ah -" said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which  is
recognized  the  whole  Galaxy  over  as  meaning  "Er, will next
Tuesday do?"
 
"Alright," said Ford, rounding on him, "what have you done?  What
are you going to do? What are your thoughts on fire development?"
 
"Well I don't know," said the hairdresser, "All they gave me  was
a couple of sticks ..."
 
"So what have you done with them?"
 
Nervously, the hairdresser fished  in  his  track  suit  top  and
handed over the fruits of his labour to Ford.
 
Ford held them up for all to see.
 
"Curling tongs," he said.
 
The crowd applauded.
 
"Never mind," said Ford, "Rome wasn't burnt in a day."
 
The crowd hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about, but
they loved it nevertheless. They applauded.
 
"Well, you're obviously being totally naive of course," said  the
girl,  "When  you've  been  in marketing as long as I have you'll
know that before any new product can be developed it  has  to  be
properly  researched. We've got to find out what people want from
fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them."
 
The crowd were tense. They  were  expecting  something  wonderful
from Ford.
 
"Stick it up your nose," he said.
 
"Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know,"  insisted
the girl, "Do people want fire that can be applied nasally?"
 
"Do you?" Ford asked the crowd.
 
"Yes!" shouted some.
 
"No!" shouted others happily.
 
They didn't know, they just thought it was great.
 
"And the wheel," said the Captain, "What about this wheel thingy?
It sounds a terribly interesting project."
 
"Ah," said the marketing  girl,  "Well,  we're  having  a  little
difficulty there."
 
"Difficulty?" exclaimed Ford,  "Difficulty?  What  do  you  mean,
difficulty?  It's  the  single  simplest  machine  in  the entire
Universe!"
 
The marketing girl soured him with a look.
 
"Alright, Mr Wiseguy," she said, "you're so clever, you  tell  us
what colour it should have."
 
The crowd went wild. One up to the home team, they thought.  Ford
shrugged his shoulders and sat down again.
 
"Almighty Zarquon," he said, "have none of you done anything?"
 
As if in answer to his question there was  a  sudden  clamour  of
noise  from  the  entrance  to  the  clearing. The crowd couldn't
believe the  amount  of  entertainment  they  were  getting  this
afternoon: in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the
remnants of their  Golgafrincham  3rd  Regiment  dress  uniforms.
About  half  of  them still carried Kill-O-Zap guns, the rest now
carried spears which they struck together as they  marched.  They
looked  bronzed,  healthy,  and utterly exhausted and bedraggled.
They clattered to a halt and banged to  attention.  One  of  them
fell over and never moved again.
 
"Captain, sir!" cried Number Two - for  he  was  their  leader  -
"Permission to report sir!"
 
"Yes, alright Number Two, welcome back and all that. Find any hot
springs?" said the Captain despondently.
 
"No sir!"
 
"Thought you wouldn't."
 
Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the
bath.
 
"We have discovered another continent!"
 
"When was this?"
 
"It lies across the sea ..." said Number Two, narrowing his  eyes
significantly, "to the east!"
 
"Ah."
 
Number Two turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above  his
head. This is going to be great, thought the crowd.
 
"We have declared war on it!"
 
Wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the  clearing
- this was beyond all expectation.
 
"Wait a minute," shouted Ford Prefect, "wait a minute!"
 
He leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while  he  got
it,  or  at  least  the  best silence he could hope for under the
circumstances: the  circumstances  were  that  the  bagpiper  was
spontaneously composing a national anthem.
 
"Do we have to have the piper?" demanded Ford.
 
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "we've given him a grant."
 
Ford considered opening this  idea  up  for  debate  but  quickly
decided that that way madness lay. Instead he slung a well judged
rock at the piper and turned to face Number Two.
 
"War?" he said.
 
"Yes!" Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect.
 
"On the next continent?"
 
"Yes! Total warfare! The war to end all wars!"
 
"But there's no one even living there yet!"
 
Ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point.
 
Number Two's gaze hovered undisturbed. In this respect  his  eyes
were  like  a  couple  of mosquitos that hover purposefully three
inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes,
fly swats or rolled newspapers.
 
"I know that," he said, "but there will be one day!  So  we  have
left an open-ended ultimatum."
 
"What?"
 
"And blown up a few military installations."
 
The Captain leaned forward out of his bath.
 
"Military installations Number Two?" he said.
 
For a moment the eyes wavered.
 
"Yes sir, well  potential  military  installations.  Alright  ...
trees."
 
The moment of uncertainty passed - his eyes flickered like  whips
over his audience.
 
"And," he roared, "we interrogated a gazelle!"
 
He flipped his Kill-O-Zap gun smartly under his arm  and  marched
off  through  the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the
ecstatic crowd. A few steps was all  he  managed  before  he  was
caught up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the
clearing.
 
Ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together.
 
"So what else have you done?" he inquired after the  celebrations
had died down.
 
"We have started a culture," said the marketing girl.
 
"Oh yes?" said Ford.
 
"Yes. One of our film producers is already making  a  fascinating
documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area."
 
"They're not cavemen."
 
"They look like cavemen."
 
"Do they live in caves?"
 
"Well ..."
 
"They live in huts."
 
"Perhaps they're having their caves redecorated,"  called  out  a
wag from the crowd.
 
Ford rounded on him angrily.
 
"Very funny," he said, "but have you noticed that  they're  dying
out?"
 
On their journey back,  Ford  and  Arthur  had  come  across  two
derelict  villages  and  the bodies of many natives in the woods,
where they had crept away to die. Those  that  still  lived  were
stricken  and listless, as if they were suffering some disease of
the spirit rather than the body. They moved sluggishly  and  with
an infinite sadness. Their future had been taken away from them.
 
"Dying out!" repeated Ford. "Do you know what that means?"
 
"Er ... we shouldn't sell them any life  insurance?"  called  out
the wag again.
 
Ford ignored him, and appealed to the whole crowd.
 
"Can you try and understand," he  said,  "that  it's  just  since
we've arrived that they've started dying out!"
 
"In fact that comes over terribly well in this  film,"  said  the
marketing  girl,  "and just gives it that poignant twist which is
the hallmark of the really great documentary. The producer's very
committed."
 
"He should be," muttered Ford.
 
"I gather," said the girl, turning to address the Captain who was
beginning  to nod off, "that he wants to make one about you next,
Captain."
 
"Oh really?" he said, coming to with  a  start,  "that's  awfully
nice."
 
"He's got a very strong angle on it,  you  know,  the  burden  of
responsibility, the loneliness of command ..."
 
The Captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment.
 
"Well, I wouldn't overstress  that  angle,  you  know,"  he  said
finally, "one's never alone with a rubber duck."
 
He held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from  the
crowd.
 
All the while, the Management  Consultant  had  been  sitting  in
stony silence, his finger tips pressed to his temples to indicate
that he was waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary.
 
At this point he decided he would not wait all day after all,  he
would merely pretend that the last half hour hadn't happened.
 
He rose to his feet.
 
"If," he said tersely, "we could for a  moment  move  on  to  the
subject of fiscal policy ..."
 
"Fiscal policy!" whooped Ford Prefect, "Fiscal policy!"
 
The Management Consultant gave him a look that  only  a  lungfish
could have copied.
 
"Fiscal policy ..." he repeated, "that is what I said."
 
"How can you have money," demanded Ford, "if none of you actually
produces anything? It doesn't grow on trees you know."
 
"If you would allow me to continue ..."
 
Ford nodded dejectedly.
 
"Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as
legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich."
 
Ford  stared  in  disbelief  at  the  crowd  who  were  murmuring
appreciatively  at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves
with which their track suits were stuffed.
 
"But we have also," continued  the  Management  Consultant,  "run
into  a  small  inflation problem on account of the high level of
leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current  going
rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship's
peanut."
 
Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd. The  Management  Consultant
waved them down.
 
"So in  order  to  obviate  this  problem,"  he  continued,  "and
effectively  revaluate  the  leaf,  we  are  about to embark on a
massive defoliation campaign, and  ...  er,  burn  down  all  the
forests.  I  think  you'll all agree that's a sensible move under
the circumstances."
 
The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for  a  second  or
two  until  someone  pointed out how much this would increase the
value of the leaves in  their  pockets  whereupon  they  let  out
whoops  of  delight and gave the Management Consultant a standing
ovation.  The  accountants  amongst  them  looked  forward  to  a
profitable Autumn.
 
"You're all mad," explained Ford Prefect.
 
"You're absolutely barmy," he suggested.
 
"You're a bunch of raving nutters," he opined.
 
The tide of opinion started to turn against him. What had started
out  as  excellent  entertainment  had  now, in the crowd's view,
deteriorated into mere abuse, and since this  abuse  was  in  the
main directed at them they wearied of it.
 
Sensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him.
 
"Is it perhaps in order," she demanded, "to inquire  what  you've
been  doing  all these months then? You and that other interloper
have been missing since the day we arrived."
 
"We've been on a journey," said Ford, "We went to  try  and  find
out something about this planet."
 
"Oh," said the girl archly, "doesn't  sound  very  productive  to
me."
 
"No? Well have I got news for you, my love.  We  have  discovered
this planet's future."
 
Ford waited for this statement to have its effect. It didn't have
any. They didn't know what he was talking about.
 
He continued.
 
"It doesn't matter a pair of fetid dingo's kidneys what  you  all
choose  to  do  from  now on. Burn down the forests, anything, it
won't make a scrap of difference. Your future history has already
happened.  Two million years you've got and that's it. At the end
of that time your race will be dead, gone and  good  riddance  to
you. Remember that, two million years!"
 
The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. People as rich as they
had  suddenly  become shouldn't be obliged to listen to this sort
of gibberish. Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and
he would go away.
 
They didn't need to bother. Ford was already stalking out of  the
clearing,  pausing  only  to shake his head at Number Two who was
already firing his Kill-O-Zap gun into some neighbouring trees.
 
He turned back once.
 
"Two million years!" he said and laughed.
 
"Well," said the Captain with a soothing smile, "still time for a
few  more baths. Could someone pass me the sponge? I just dropped
it over the side."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 33
 
A mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent  was  too  busily
engrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach.
 
What he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on
a  wide  flat  piece  of rock he had scratched out the shape of a
large square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty-nine  smaller
squares, thirteen to a side.
 
Furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish
stones  and  scratched  the shape of a letter on to each. Sitting
morosely round the rock were a  couple  of  the  surviving  local
native  men  whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious
concept embodied in these stones.
 
So far they had not done well. They had attempted to eat some  of
them,  bury  others  and  throw the rest of them away. Arthur had
finally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones  on  the
board  he  had  scratched  out, which was not even as far as he'd
managed to get the day before. Along with the rapid deterioration
in   the  morale  of  these  creatures,  there  seemed  to  be  a
corresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence.
 
In an attempt to egg them along,  Arthur  set  out  a  number  of
letters  on  the  board  himself, and then tried to encourage the
natives to add some more themselves.
 
It was not going well.
 
Ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree.
 
"No," said Arthur to one of the natives  who  had  just  shuffled
some  of  the  letters  round  in  a fit of abysmal dejection, "Q
scores ten you see, and it's on a triple word score, so ... look,
I've  explained the rules to you ... no no, look please, put down
that  jawbone  ...  alright,  we'll  start  again.  And  try   to
concentrate this time."
 
Ford leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand  against  his
head.
 
"What are you doing, Arthur?" he asked quietly.
 
Arthur looked up with a start. He suddenly had a feeling that all
this  might  look  slightly  foolish. All he knew was that it had
worked like a dream on him when he was a chid.  But  things  were
different then, or rather would be.
 
"I'm trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble," he said.
 
"They're not cavemen," said Ford.
 
"They look like cavemen."
 
Ford let it pass.
 
"I see," he said.
 
"It's uphill work," said Arthur wearily, "the only word they know
is grunt and they can't spell it."
 
He sighed and sat back.
 
"What's that supposed to achieve?" asked Ford.
 
"We've got to encourage them to evolve! To develop!" Arthur burst
out  angrily.  He  hoped  that  the weary sigh and then the anger
might do  something  to  counteract  the  overriding  feeling  of
foolishness  from which he was currently suffering. It didn't. He
jumped to his feet.
 
"Can you imagine what a world would be like descended from  those
... cretins we arrived with?" he said.
 
"Imagine?" said Ford, rising his  eyebrows.  "We  don't  have  to
imagine. We've seen it."
 
"But ..." Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly.
 
"We've seen it," said Ford, "there's no escape."
 
Arthur kicked at a stone.
 
"Did you tell them what we've discovered?" he asked.
 
"Hmmmm?" said Ford, not really concentrating.
 
"Norway,"  said  Arthur,  "Slartibartfast's  signature   in   the
glacier. Did you tell them?"
 
"What's the point?" said Ford, "What would it mean to them?"
 
"Mean?" said Arthur, "Mean?  You  know  perfectly  well  what  it
means. It means that this planet is the Earth! It's my home! It's
where I was born!"
 
"Was?" said Ford.
 
"Alright, will be."
 
"Yes, in two million years' time. Why don't you tell  them  that?
Go  and  say to them, `Excuse me, I'd just like to point out that
in two million years' time I will be born just a few  miles  from
here.'  See  what  they  say. They'll chase you up a tree and set
fire to it."
 
Arthur absorbed this unhappily.
 
"Face it," said Ford, "those zeebs over there are your ancestors,
not these poor creatures here."
 
He went  over  to  where  the  apemen  creatures  were  rummaging
listlessly with the stone letters. He shook his head.
 
"Put the Scrabble away, Arthur," he  said,  "it  won't  save  the
human  race,  because this lot aren't going to be the human race.
The human race is currently sitting round a  rock  on  the  other
side of this hill making documentaries about themselves."
 
Arthur winced.
 
"There must be something we can do," he said. A terrible sense of
desolation  thrilled  through his body that he should be here, on
the Earth, the Earth which had lost its future  in  a  horrifying
arbitrary  catastrophe  and which now seemed set to lose its past
as well.
 
"No," said Ford, "there's nothing we can do. This doesn't  change
the  history  of  the  Earth, you see, this is the history of the
Earth. Like it or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you
are  descended  from.  in two million years they get destroyed by
the Vogons. History is  never  altered  you  see,  it  just  fits
together like a jigsaw. Funny old thing, life, isn't it?"
 
He picked up the letter Q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush
where it hit a young rabbit. The rabbit hurtled off in terror and
didn't stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which  choked
on  one  of  its  bones  and  died  on the bank of a stream which
subsequently washed it away.
 
During the following weeks Ford Prefect swallowed his  pride  and
struck  up  a  relationship  with a girl who had been a personnel
officer on Golgafrincham, and he  was  terribly  upset  when  she
suddenly  passed  away  as a result of drinking water from a pool
that had been polluted by the body of a dead fox. The only  moral
it  is  possible to draw from this story is that one should never
throw the letter Q into a pivet bush, but unfortunately there are
times when it is unavoidable.
 
Like most of the really crucial things in  life,  this  chain  of
events  was completely invisible to Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent.
They were looking sadly at one of the  natives  morosely  pushing
the other letters around.
 
"Poor bloody caveman," said Arthur.
 
"They're not ..."
 
"What?"
 
"Oh never mind."
 
The wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged
on the rock.
 
"It's all been a bit of waste of time for them, hasn't it?"  said
Arthur.
 
"Uh uh urghhhhh," muttered the native  and  banged  on  the  rock
again.
 
"They've been outevolved by telephone sanitizers."
 
"Urgh, gr gr, gruh!" insisted the native, continuing to  bang  on
the rock.
 
"Why does he keep banging on the rock?" said Arthur.
 
"I think he probably wants you to Scrabble with him again,"  said
Ford, "he's pointing at the letters."
 
"Probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor  bastard.  I  keep  on
telling him there's only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc."
 
The native banged on the rock again.
 
They looked over his shoulder.
 
Their eyes popped.
 
There amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid
out in a clear straight line.
 
They spelt two words.
 
The words were these:
 
"Forty-Two."
 
"Grrrurgh guh guh," explained the native. He  swept  the  letters
angrily  away  and  went and mooched under a nearby tree with his
colleague.
 
Ford and Arthur stared at him. Then they stared at each other.
 
"Did that say what I thought it said?" they  both  said  to  each
other.
 
"Yes," they both said.
 
"Forty-two," said Arthur.
 
"Forty-two," said Ford.
 
Arthur ran over to the two natives.
 
"What are you trying to tell us?" he shouted. "What's it supposed
to mean?"
 
One of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in  the
air, rolled over again and went to sleep.
 
The other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts  at  Ford
Prefect.  Whatever  it was they had to say, they had already said
it.
 
"You know what this means," said Ford.
 
"Not entirely."
 
"Forty-two is the number Deep Thought gave as being the  Ultimate
Answer."
 
"Yes."
 
And the Earth is the computer Deep Thought designed and built  to
calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer."
 
"So we are led to believe."
 
"And organic life was part of the computer matrix."
 
"If you say so."
 
"I do say so. That means that these natives, these apemen are  an
integral  part  of  the  computer  program,  and  that we and the
Golgafrinchans are not."
 
"But the  cavemen  are  dying  out  and  the  Golgafrinchans  are
obviously set to replace them."
 
"Exactly. So do you see what this means?"
 
"What?"
 
"Cock up," said Ford Prefect.
 
Arthur looked around him.
 
"This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it," he said.
 
Ford puzzled for a moment.
 
"Still, something must have come out of it,"  he  said  at  last,
"because  Marvin  said  he could see the Question printed in your
brain wave patterns."
 
"But ..."
 
"Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of  the  right  one.  It
might  give us a clue though if we could find it. I don't see how
we can though."
 
They moped about for a bit. Arthur sat on the ground and  started
pulling  up bits of grass, but found that it wasn't an occupation
he could get deeply  engrossed  in.  It  wasn't  grass  he  could
believe  in, the trees seemed pointless, the rolling hills seemed
to be rolling to nowhere and the future seemed just a  tunnel  to
be crawled through.
 
Ford fiddled with his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It  was  silent.  He
sighed and put it away.
 
Arthur picked up one of the  letter  stones  from  his  home-made
Scrabble  set.  It  was a T. He sighed and out it down again. The
letter he put down next to it was an I. That spelt IT. He  tossed
another couple of letters next to them They were an S and an H as
it  happened.  By  a  curious  coincidence  the  resulting   word
perfectly  expressed the way Arthur was feeling about things just
then.  He  stared  at  it  for  a  moment.  He  hadn't  done   it
deliberately,  it  was just a random chance. His brain got slowly
into first gear.
 
"Ford," he said suddenly, "look, if that Question is  printed  in
my  brain  wave  patterns  but I'm not consciously aware of it it
must be somewhere in my unconscious."
 
"Yes, I suppose so."
 
"There might be  a  way  of  bringing  that  unconscious  pattern
forward."
 
"Oh yes?"
 
"Yes, by introducing some random element that can  be  shaped  by
that pattern."
 
"Like how?"
 
"Like by pulling Scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded."
 
Ford leapt to his feet.
 
"Brilliant!" he said. He tugged his towel out of his satchel  and
with a few deft knots transformed it into a bag.
 
"Totally mad," he said, "utter nonsense. But we'll do it  because
it's brilliant nonsense. Come on, come on."
 
The sun passed respectfully behind  a  cloud.  A  few  small  sad
raindrops fell.
 
They piled together all the remaining letters  and  dropped  them
into the bag. They shook them up.
 
"Right," said Ford, "close your eyes. Pull them out. Come on come
on, come on."
 
Arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful  of
stones. He jiggled them about, pulled out four and handed them to
Ford. Ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them.
 
"W," said Ford, "H, A, T ... What!"
 
He blinked.
 
"I think it's working!" he said.
 
Arthur pushed three more at him.
 
"D, O, Y ... Doy. Oh perhaps it isn't working," said Ford.
 
"Here's the next three."
 
"O, U, G ... Doyoug ... It's not making sense I'm afraid."
 
Arthur pulled another two from the bag. Ford put them in place.
 
"E, T, doyouget ... Do you get!" shouted Ford,  "it  is  working!
This is amazing, it really is working!"
 
"More here." Arthur was throwing them out feverishly as  fast  as
he could go.
 
"I, F," said Ford, "Y, O, U, ... M, U, L, T, I, P, L, Y, ... What
do  you  get if you multiply, ... S, I, X, ... six, B, Y, by, six
by ... what do you get if you multiply six by ... N, I, N, E, ...
six by nine ..." He paused. "Come on, where's the next one?"
 
"Er, that's the lot," said Arthur, "that's all there were."
 
He sat back, nonplussed.
 
He rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were  no
more letters.
 
"You mean that's it?" said Ford.
 
"That's it."
 
"Six by nine. Forty-two."
 
"That's it. That's all there is."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 34
 
The sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them. A  bird  sang.  A
warm  breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the
flowers, carrying their scent away through the woods.  An  insect
droned  past  on  its way to do whatever it is that insects do in
the late afternoon. The sound of voices lilted through the  trees
followed  a  moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at
the sight of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent apparently lying on the
ground in agony, but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter.
 
"No, don't go," called Ford Prefect between gasps, "we'll be with
you in a moment."
 
"What's the matter?" asked one of the girls. She was  the  taller
and  slimmer  of  the two. On Golgafrincham she had been a junior
personnel officer, but hadn't liked it much.
 
Ford pulled himself together.
 
"Excuse  me,"  he  said,  "hello.  My  friend  and  I  were  just
contemplating the meaning of life. Frivolous exercise."
 
"Oh it's you," said the girl, "you made a bit of a  spectacle  of
yourself  this  afternoon. You were quite funny to begin with but
you did bang on a bit."
 
"Did I? Oh yes."
 
"Yes, what was all that for?" asked the  other  girl,  a  shorter
round-faced  girl  who  had  been  an  art  director  for a small
advertising company on Golgafrincham. Whatever the privations  of
this  world  were,  she  went  to  sleep  every  night profoundly
grateful for the fact that  whatever  she  had  to  face  in  the
morning  it wouldn't be a hundred almost identical photographs of
moodily lit tubes of toothpaste.
 
"For? For nothing. Nothing's for  anything,"  said  Ford  Prefect
happily.  "Come  and  join  us. I"m Ford, this is Arthur. We were
just about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait."
 
The girls looked at them doubtfully.
 
"I'm Agda," said the tall one, "this is Mella."
 
"Hello Agda, hello Mella," said Ford.
 
"Do you talk at all?" said Mella to Arthur.
 
"Oh, eventually," said Arthur with a smile, "but not as  much  as
Ford."
 
"Good."
 
There was a slight pause.
 
"What did you mean," asked Agda, "about only having  two  million
years? I couldn't make sense of what you were saying."
 
"Oh that," said Ford, "it doesn't matter."
 
"It's just that the world gets  demolished  to  make  way  for  a
hyperspace  bypass,"  said  Arthur  with a shrug, "but that's two
million years away, and anyway it's just Vogons doing what Vogons
do."
 
"Vogons?" said Mella.
 
"Yes, you wouldn't know them."
 
"Where'd you get this idea from?"
 
"It really doesn't matter. It's just like a dream from the  past,
or the future." Arthur smiled and looked away.
 
"Does it worry you that you don't talk any kind of sense?"  asked
Agda.
 
"Listen, forget it,"  said  Ford,  "forget  all  of  it.  Nothing
matters. Look, it's a beautiful day, enjoy it. The sun, the green
of the hills, the river down in the valley, the burning trees."
 
"Even if it's only a dream, it's a pretty  horrible  idea,"  said
Mella, "destroying a world just to make a bypass."
 
"Oh, I've heard of worse," said Ford, "I read of one  planet  off
in  the  seventh  dimension  that got used as a ball in a game of
intergalactic bar billiards. Got potted  straight  into  a  black
hole. Killed ten billion people."
 
"That's mad," said Mella.
 
"Yes, only scored thirty points too."
 
Agda and Mella exchanged glances.
 
"Look," said Agda, "there's a party after the  committee  meeting
tonight. You can come along if you like."
 
"Yeah, OK," said Ford.
 
"I'd like to," said Arthur.
 
Many hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the  moon  rise
over the dull red glow of the trees.
 
"That story about the world being destroyed ..." began Mella.
 
"In two million years, yes."
 
"You say it as if you really think it's true."
 
"Yes, I think it is. I think I was there."
 
She shook her head in puzzlement.
 
"You're very strange," she said.
 
"No, I'm very ordinary," said  Arthur,  "but  some  very  strange
things  have happened to me. You could say I'm more differed from
than differing."
 
"And that other world your friend talked about, the one that  got
pushed into a black hole."
 
"Ah, that I don't know about. It sounds like something  from  the
book."
 
"What book?"
 
Arthur paused.
 
"The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy," he said at last.
 
"What's that?"
 
"Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I  don't
think I'll be wanting it any more," said Arthur Dent.

Chapter 1
 
The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of  Arthur
Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was.
 
It wasn't just that the cave was cold, it wasn't just that it was
damp  and smelly. It was the fact that the cave was in the middle
of Islington and there wasn't a bus due for two million years.
 
Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in,  as  Arthur
Dent  could  testify,  having  been lost in both time and space a
good deal. At least being lost in space kept you busy.
 
He was stranded in prehistoric Earth as the result of  a  complex
sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown
up and insulted in more bizarre regions of  the  Galaxy  than  he
ever  dreamt  existed,  and  though his life had now turned very,
very, very quiet, he was still feeling jumpy.
 
He hadn't been blown up now for five years.
 
Since he had hardly seen anyone since he  and  Ford  Prefect  had
parted  company four years previously, he hadn't been insulted in
all that time either.
 
Except just once.
 
It had happened on a spring evening about two years previously.
 
He was returning to his cave just a little  after  dusk  when  he
became  aware  of  lights  flashing eerily through the clouds. He
turned and stared, with  hope  suddenly  clambering  through  his
heart. Rescue. Escape. The castaway's impossible dream - a ship.
 
And as he watched, as he stared in wonder and excitement, a  long
silver  ship  descended  through  the  warm evening air, quietly,
without fuss, its long legs  unlocking  in  a  smooth  ballet  of
technology.
 
It alighted gently on the ground, and  what  little  hum  it  had
generated died away, as if lulled by the evening calm.
 
A ramp extended itself.
 
Light streamed out.
 
A tall figure appeared silhouetted in  the  hatchway.  It  walked
down the ramp and stood in front of Arthur.
 
"You're a jerk, Dent," it said simply.
 
It was alien, very alien. It had a  peculiar  alien  tallness,  a
peculiar alien flattened head, peculiar slitty little alien eyes,
extravagantly draped golden ropes with a peculiarly alien  collar
design,  and  pale  grey-green alien skin which had about it that
lustrous shine which most grey-green faces can only acquire  with
plenty of exercise and very expensive soap.
 
Arthur boggled at it.
 
It gazed levelly at him.
 
Arthur's first sensations of hope and trepidation  had  instantly
been  overwhelmed by astonishment, and all sorts of thoughts were
battling for the use of his vocal chords at this moment.
 
"Whh ...?" he said.
 
"Bu ... hu ... uh ..." he added.
 
"Ru ... ra ... wah ... who?" he managed finally to say and lapsed
into  a  frantic  kind  of silence. He was feeling the effects of
having not said anything to anybody  for  as  long  as  he  could
remember.
 
The alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to
be some species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and
spindly alien hand.
 
"Arthur Dent?" it said.
 
Arthur nodded helplessly.
 
"Arthur Philip Dent?" pursued the alien in a  kind  of  efficient
yap.
 
"Er ... er ... yes ... er ... er," confirmed Arthur.
 
"You're a jerk," repeated the alien, "a complete asshole."
 
"Er ..."
 
The creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on  its
clipboard and turned briskly back towards the ship.
 
"Er ..." said Arthur desperately, "er ..."
 
"Don't give me that!" snapped the alien. It marched up the  ramp,
through  the  hatchway  and  disappeared  into the ship. The ship
sealed itself. It started to make a low throbbing hum.
 
"Er, hey!" shouted Arthur, and started to run helplessly  towards
it.
 
"Wait a minute!" he called. "What is this? What? Wait a minute!"
 
The ship rose, as if shedding its weight  like  a  cloak  to  the
ground,  and  hovered  briefly.  It  swept  strangely up into the
evening sky. It passed up through the clouds,  illuminating  them
briefly,  and then was gone, leaving Arthur alone in an immensity
of land dancing a helplessly tiny little dance.
 
"What?" he screamed. "What? What? Hey, what? Come back  here  and
say that!"
 
He jumped and danced until his legs trembled,  and  shouted  till
his  lungs  rasped. There was no answer from anyone. There was no
one to hear him or speak to him.
 
The alien ship was already thundering towards the  upper  reaches
of  the  atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which
separates the very few things there are in the Universe from each
other.
 
Its occupant, the alien with  the  expensive  complexion,  leaned
back  in  its  single seat. His name was Wowbagger the Infinitely
Prolonged. He was a man with a purpose. Not a very good  purpose,
as  he  would have been the first to admit, but it was at least a
purpose and it did at least keep him on the move.
 
Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was --indeed, is - one of  the
Universe's very small number of immortal beings.
 
Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to  cope  with
it, but Wowbagger was not one of them. Indeed he had come to hate
them, the load of serene bastards. He  had  had  his  immortality
thrust  upon  him  by  an unfortunate accident with an irrational
particle accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber  bands.
The  precise details of the accident are not important because no
one has ever managed to duplicate the exact  circumstances  under
which  it  happened,  and  many people have ended up looking very
silly, or dead, or both, trying.
 
Wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim  and  weary  expression,  put
some light jazz on the ship's stereo, and reflected that he could
have made it if it hadn't been for Sunday afternoons,  he  really
could have done.
 
To begin with it was fun, he  had  a  ball,  living  dangerously,
taking  risks,  cleaning  up on high-yield long-term investments,
and just generally outliving the hell out of everybody.
 
In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't  cope  with,
and  that  terrible  listlessness which starts to set in at about
2.55, when you know  that  you've  had  all  the  baths  you  can
usefully  have that day, that however hard you stare at any given
paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it,  or  use
the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as
you stare at the clock the hands will  move  relentlessly  on  to
four  o'clock,  and  you  will enter the long dark teatime of the
soul.
 
So things began to pall for him. The merry smiles he used to wear
at other people's funerals began to fade. He began to despise the
Universe in general, and everyone in it in particular.
 
This was the point at which he conceived his purpose,  the  thing
which  would  drive  him  on,  and which, as far as he could see,
would drive him on forever. It was this.
 
He would insult the Universe.
 
That  is,  he  would  insult  everybody  in   it.   Individually,
personally, one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided
to grit his teeth over) in alphabetical order.
 
When people protested to him, as they sometimes  had  done,  that
the plan was not merely misguided but actually impossible because
of the number of people being born and dying  all  the  time,  he
would  merely  fix  them  with  a steely look and say, "A man can
dream can't he?"
 
And so he started out. He equipped a spaceship that was built  to
last   with  the  computer  capable  of  handling  all  the  data
processing involved in keeping track of the entire population  of
the  known  Universe and working out the horrifically complicated
routes involved.
 
His ship fled through the inner orbits of the  Sol  star  system,
preparing  to  slingshot  round the sun and fling itself out into
interstellar space.
 
"Computer," he said.
 
"Here," yipped the computer.
 
"Where next?"
 
"Computing that."
 
Wowbagger gazed for a moment at the fantastic  jewellery  of  the
night,  the  billions  of  tiny  diamond  worlds  that dusted the
infinite darkness with light. Every one, every single one, was on
his  itinerary.  Most  of  them  he would be going to millions of
times over.
 
He imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots
in  the  sky  like  a child's numbered dots puzzle. He hoped that
from some vantage point in the Universe it might be seen to spell
a very, very rude word.
 
The computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it  had  finished
its calculations.
 
"Folfanga," it said. It beeped.
 
"Fourth world of the Folfanga system," it  continued.  It  beeped
again.
 
"Estimated journey time, three weeks," it continued  further.  It
beeped again.
 
"There to meet with a small slug," it beeped, "of  the  genus  A-
Rth-Urp-Hil-Ipdenu."
 
"I believe," it added, after  a  slight  pause  during  which  it
beeped, "that you had decided to call it a brainless prat."
 
Wowbagger grunted. He watched the majesty of creation outside his
window for a moment or two.
 
"I think I'll take a nap," he said, and then added, "what network
areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours?"
 
The computer beeped.
 
"Cosmovid, Thinkpix and Home Brain Box," it said, and beeped.
 
"Any movies I haven't seen thirty thousand times already?"
 
"No."
 
"Uh."
 
"There's Angst in  Space.  You've  only  seen  that  thirty-three
thousand five hundred and seventeen times."
 
"Wake me for the second reel."
 
The computer beeped.
 
"Sleep well," it said.
 
The ship fled on through the night.
 
Meanwhile, on Earth, it began to pour with rain and  Arthur  Dent
sat  in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of
his entire life, thinking of things he could  have  said  to  the
alien and swatting flies, who also had a rotten evening.
 
The next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit  skin  because
he thought it would be useful to keep things in.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 2
 
This morning, two years later than that, was sweet  and  fragrant
as  he  emerged from the cave he called home until he could think
of a better name for it or find a better cave.
 
Though his throat was sore again from his early morning  yell  of
horror,  he  was suddenly in a terrifically good mood. He wrapped
his dilapidated dressing gown tightly around him  and  beamed  at
the bright morning.
 
The air was clear and scented, the breeze flitted lightly through
the tall grass around his cave, the birds were chirruping at each
other, the butterflies were  flitting  about  prettily,  and  the
whole  of  nature seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it
possibly could.
 
It wasn't all the pastoral delights that were making Arthur  feel
so  cheery, though. He had just had a wonderful idea about how to
cope with the terrible  lonely  isolation,  the  nightmares,  the
failure  of  all  his  attempts  at  horticulture,  and the sheer
futurelessness and futility  of  his  life  here  on  prehistoric
Earth, which was that he would go mad.
 
He beamed again and took a bite out of a  rabbit  leg  left  over
from  his  supper.  He  chewed happily for a few moments and then
decided formally to announce his decision.
 
He stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the  fields
and hills. To add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in
his hair. He spread his arms out wide.
 
"I will go mad!" he announced.
 
"Good idea," said Ford Prefect, clambering down from the rock  on
which he had been sitting.
 
Arthur's brain somersaulted. His jaw did press-ups.
 
"I went mad for a while," said Ford, "did me no end of good."
 
"You see," said Ford, "- ..."
 
"Where have you been?" interrupted Arthur, now that his head  had
finished working out.
 
"Around," said Ford, "around and about." He grinned  in  what  he
accurately  judged  to  be an infuriating manner. "I just took my
mind off the hook for a bit. I reckoned that if the world  wanted
me badly enough it would call back. It did."
 
 He took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel
his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic.
 
"At least," he said, "I think it did. This has been playing up  a
bit."  He  shook it. "If it was a false alarm I shall go mad," he
said, "again."
 
Arthur shook his head and sat down. He looked up.
 
"I thought you must be dead ..." he said simply.
 
"So did I for a while," said Ford, "and then I decided  I  was  a
lemon  for  a couple of weeks. A kept myself amused all that time
jumping in and out of a gin and tonic."
 
Arthur cleared his throat, and then did it again.
 
"Where," he said, "did you ...?"
 
"Find a gin and tonic?" said Ford brightly. "I found a small lake
that  thought  it  was  a gin and tonic, and jumped in and out of
that. At least, I think it thought it was a gin and tonic."
 
"I may," he added with a grin which  would  have  sent  sane  men
scampering into trees, "have been imagining it."
 
He waited for a reaction from Arthur, but Arthur knew better than
that.
 
"Carry on," he said levelly.
 
"The point is, you see," said Ford, "that there is  no  point  in
driving yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad. You might
just as well give in and save your sanity for later."
 
"And this is you sane again, is it?" said Arthur. "I  ask  merely
for information."
 
"I went to Africa," said Ford.
 
"Yes?"
 
"Yes."
 
"What was that like?"
 
"And this is your cave is it?" said Ford.
 
"Er, yes," said Arthur. He felt very strange. After  nearly  four
years  of  total  isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see
Ford that he could almost cry. Ford was, on the  other  hand,  an
almost immediately annoying person.
 
"Very nice," said Ford, in reference to Arthur's cave. "You  must
hate it."
 
Arthur didn't bother to reply.
 
"Africa was very interesting," said Ford, "I behaved  very  oddly
there."
 
He gazed thoughtfully into the distance.
 
"I took up being cruel to animals," he said airily.  "But  only,"
he added, "as a hobby."
 
"Oh yes," said Arthur, warily.
 
"Yes," Ford assured him. "I won't disturb you  with  the  details
because they would -"
 
"What?"
 
"Disturb you. But you  may  be  interested  to  know  that  I  am
singlehandedly  responsible  for  the evolved shape of the animal
you came to know in later centuries as a giraffe. And I tried  to
learn to fly. Do you believe me?"
 
"Tell me," said Arthur.
 
"I'll tell you later. I'll just mention that the Guide says ..."
 
"The ...?"
 
"Guide. The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. You remember?"
 
"Yes. I remember throwing it in the river."
 
"Yes," said Ford, "but I fished it out."
 
"You didn't tell me."
 
"I didn't want you to throw it in again."
 
"Fair enough," admitted Arthur. "It says?"
 
"What?"
 
"The Guide says?"
 
"The Guide says there is an art to flying," said Ford, "or rather
a  knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the
ground and miss." He smiled weakly. He pointed at  the  knees  of
his  trousers  and held his arms up to show the elbows. They were
all torn and worn through.
 
"I haven't done very well so far," he  said.  He  stuck  out  his
hand. "I'm very glad to see you again, Arthur," he added.
 
Arthur  shook  his  head  in  a  sudden  access  of  emotion  and
bewilderment.
 
"I haven't seen anyone for years," he said, "not  anyone.  I  can
hardly  even  remember  how  to speak. I keep forgetting words. I
practise you see. I practise by talking to  ...  talking  to  ...
what  are  those  things  people think you're mad if you talk to?
Like George the Third."
 
"Kings?" suggested Ford.
 
"No, no," said Arthur. "The things he  used  to  talk  to.  We're
surrounded  by  them  for  heaven's  sake.  I've planted hundreds
myself. They all died. Trees! I practise  by  talking  to  trees.
What's that for?"
 
Ford still had his hand stuck  out.  Arthur  looked  at  it  with
incomprehension.
 
"Shake," prompted Ford.
 
Arthur did, nervously at first, as if it might turn out to  be  a
fish.  Then  he  grasped  it  vigorously  with  both  hands in an
overwhelming flood of relief. He shook it and shook it.
 
After a while Ford found it necessary to disengage. They  climbed
to  the  top  of  a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene
around them.
 
"What happened to the Golgafrinchans?" asked Ford.
 
Arthur shrugged.
 
"A lot of them didn't make it  through  the  winter  three  years
ago,"  he said, "and the few who remained in the spring said they
needed a holiday and set off on a raft. History  says  that  they
must have survived ..."
 
"Huh," said Ford, "well well." He stuck his hands on his hips and
looked  round again at the empty world. Suddenly, there was about
Ford a sense of energy and purpose.
 
"We're going," he said excitedly, and shivered with energy.
 
"Where? How?" said Arthur.
 
"I don't know," said Ford, "but I just  feel  that  the  time  is
right. Things are going to happen. We're on our way."
 
He lowered his voice to a whisper.
 
"I have detected," he said, "disturbances in the wash."
 
He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite
like  the  wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point,
but the wind was busy fooling around with some  leaves  a  little
way off.
 
Arthur asked him to repeat what  he  had  just  said  because  he
hadn't quite taken his meaning. Ford repeated it.
 
"The wash?" said Arthur.
 
"The space-time wash," said Ford, and as the  wind  blew  briefly
past at that moment, he bared his teeth into it.
 
Arthur nodded, and then cleared his throat.
 
"Are we talking about," he asked cautiously, "some sort of  Vogon
laundromat, or what are we talking about?"
 
"Eddies," said Ford, "in the space-time continuum."
 
"Ah," nodded Arthur, "is he? Is he?" He pushed his hands into the
pocket  of  his  dressing  gown and looked knowledgeably into the
distance.
 
"What?" said Ford.
 
"Er, who," said Arthur, "is Eddy, then, exactly?"
 
Ford looked angrily at him.
 
"Will you listen?" he snapped.
 
"I have been listening," said Arthur,  "but  I'm  not  sure  it's
helped."
 
Ford grasped him by the lapels of his dressing gown and spoke  to
him as slowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody
from a telephone company accounts department.
 
"There seem ..." he said, "to be some pools  ..."  he  said,  "of
instability ..." he said, "in the fabric ..." he said ...
 
Arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing  gown  where
Ford  was  holding it. Ford swept on before Arthur could turn the
foolish look into a foolish remark.
 
"... in the fabric of space-time," he said.
 
"Ah, that," said Arthur.
 
"Yes, that," confirmed Ford.
 
They stood there alone on a hill on prehistoric Earth and  stared
each other resolutely in the face.
 
"And it's done what?" said Arthur.
 
"It," said Ford, "has developed pools of instability."
 
"Has it?" said Arthur, his eyes not wavering for a moment.
 
"It has," said Ford with a similar degree of ocular immobility.
 
"Good," said Arthur.
 
"See?" said Ford.
 
"No," said Arthur.
 
There was a quiet pause.
 
"The difficulty with this conversation," said Arthur after a sort
of  pondering  look  had  crawled  slowly  across his face like a
mountaineer negotiating a tricky  outcrop,  "is  that  it's  very
different  from  most  of  the ones I've had of late. Which, as I
explained, have mostly been with trees. They weren't  like  this.
Except  perhaps  some  of  the  ones  I've  had  with  elms which
sometimes get a bit bogged down."
 
"Arthur," said Ford.
 
"Hello? Yes?" said Arthur.
 
"Just believe everything I tell you, and it  will  all  be  very,
very simple."
 
"Ah, well I'm not sure I believe that."
 
They sat down and composed their thoughts.
 
Ford got out his  Sub-Etha  Sens-O-Matic.  It  was  making  vague
humming noises and a tiny light on it was flickering faintly.
 
"Flat battery?" said Arthur.
 
"No," said Ford, "there is a moving disturbance in the fabric  of
space-time, an eddy, a pool of instability, and it's somewhere in
our vicinity."
 
"Where?"
 
Ford moved the device in  a  slow  lightly  bobbing  semi-circle.
Suddenly the light flashed.
 
"There!" said Ford, shooting out his  arm.  "There,  behind  that
sofa!"
 
Arthur looked. Much to his surprise, there was a velvet  paisley-
covered  Chesterfield  sofa  in  the  field  in front of them. He
boggled intelligently at it. Shrewd  questions  sprang  into  his
mind.
 
"Why," he said, "is there a sofa in that field?"
 
"I told you!" shouted Ford, leaping to his feet. "Eddies  in  the
space-time continuum!"
 
"And this is his sofa, is it?" asked Arthur,  struggling  to  his
feet  and,  he  hoped,  though  not  very  optimistically, to his
senses.
 
"Arthur!" shouted Ford at him, "that sofa is there because of the
space-time  instability  I've  been trying to get your terminally
softened brain to get to grips with. It's been washed out of  the
continuum,  it's space-time jetsam, it doesn't matter what it is,
we've got to catch it, it's our only way out of here!"
 
He scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made  off  across
the field.
 
"Catch it?" muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he saw
that  the Chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across
the grass.
 
With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock
and  plunged  off  in  hectic  pursuit  of  Ford  Prefect and the
irrational piece of furniture.
 
They  careered  wildly  through  the  grass,  leaping,  laughing,
shouting  instructions  to  each other to head the thing off this
way or that way. The sun shone dreamily  on  the  swaying  grass,
tiny field animals scattered crazily in their wake.
 
Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day  was  for
once  working  out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes
ago he had decided he would  go  mad,  and  now  he  was  already
chasing  a  Chesterfield  sofa  across  the fields of prehistoric
Earth.
 
The sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be
as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as
a billowing dream as it floated like a ghost through others.
 
Ford and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it  dodged  and
weaved  as  if following its own complex mathematical topography,
which it was. Still they pursued, still it danced and  span,  and
suddenly   turned  and  dipped  as  if  crossing  the  lip  of  a
catastrophe graph, and they were practically on top of it. With a
heave and a shout they leapt on it, the sun winked out, they fell
through a sickening nothingness, and emerged unexpectedly in  the
middle  of  the  pitch  at Lord's Cricked Ground, St John's Wood,
London, towards the end of the last Test Match of the  Australian
Series  in  the year 198-, with England needing only twenty-eight
runs to win.

=================================================================
Chapter 4
 
It was a charming and delightful day at Lord's as Ford and Arthur
tumbled  haphazardly  out  of  a  space-time  anomaly and hit the
immaculate turf rather hard.
 
The applause of the crowd was tremendous. It wasn't for them, but
instinctively  they bowed anyway, which was fortunate because the
small red heavy ball which the crowd actually had been applauding
whistled  mere millimetres over Arthur's head. In the crowd a man
collapsed.
 
They threw themselves back to the ground  which  seemed  to  spin
hideously around them.
 
"What was that?" hissed Arthur.
 
"Something red," hissed Ford back at him.
 
"Where are we?"
 
"Er, somewhere green."
 
"Shapes," muttered Arthur. "I need shapes."
 
The applause of the crowd had been rapidly succeeded by gasps  of
astonishment,  and  the awkward titters of hundreds of people who
could not yet make up their minds about whether to  believe  what
they had just seen or not.
 
"This your sofa?" said a voice.
 
"What was that?" whispered Ford.
 
Arthur looked up.
 
"Something blue," he said.
 
"Shape?" said Ford.
 
Arthur looked again.
 
"It is shaped,"  he  hissed  at  Ford,  with  his  brow  savagely
furrowing, "like a policeman."
 
They remained crouched there for a few moments, frowning  deeply.
The  blue  thing  shaped like a policeman tapped them both on the
shoulders.
 
"Come on, you two," the shape said, "let's be having you."
 
These words had an electrifying effect on Arthur. He leapt to his
feet  like  an author hearing the phone ring and shot a series of
startled glanced at the panorama around him  which  had  suddenly
settled down into something of quite terrifying ordinariness.
 
"Where did you get this from?" he yelled at the policeman shape.
 
"What did you say?" said the startled shape.
 
"This is Lord's Cricket Ground, isn't it?" snapped Arthur. "Where
did  you  find  it,  how did you get it here? I think," he added,
clasping his hand to his brow, "that I had better calm down."  He
squatted down abruptly in front of Ford.
 
"It is a policeman," he said, "What do we do?"
 
Ford shrugged.
 
"What do you want to do?" he said.
 
"I want you," said Arthur, "to tell me that I have been  dreaming
for the last five years."
 
Ford shrugged again, and obliged.
 
"You've been dreaming for the last five years," he said.
 
Arthur got to his feet.
 
"It's all right, officer," he said. "I've been dreaming  for  the
last five years. Ask him," he added, pointing at Ford, "he was in
it."
 
Having said this, he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch,
brushing  down  his  dressing  gown. He then noticed his dressing
gown and stopped. He stared  at  it.  He  flung  himself  at  the
policeman.
 
"So where did I get these clothes from?" he howled.
 
He collapsed and lay twitching on the grass.
 
Ford shook his head.
 
"He's had a bad two million years," he said to the policeman, and
together  they  heaved  Arthur on to the sofa and carried him off
the  pitch  and  were  only  briefly  hampered  by   the   sudden
disappearance of the sofa on the way.
 
Reaction to all this from the crowd were many and  various.  Most
of them couldn't cope with watching it, and listened to it on the
radio instead.
 
"Well, this is an interesting incident, Brian,"  said  one  radio
commentator  to  another.  "I  don't  think  there  have been any
mysterious materializations on the pitch since, oh since, well  I
don't think there have been any - have there? - that I recall?"
 
"Edgbaston, 1932?"
 
"Ah, now what happened then ..."
 
"Well, Peter, I think it was Canter facing Willcox coming  up  to
bowl from the pavilion end when a spectator suddenly ran straight
across the pitch."
 
There was a pause while the first commentator considered this.
 
"Ye ... e ... s ..." he said, "yes, there's nothing actually very
mysterious  about that, is there? He didn't actually materialize,
did he? Just ran on."
 
"No, that's true,  but  he  did  claim  to  have  seen  something
materialize on the pitch."
 
"Ah, did he?"
 
"Yes. An alligator, I think, of some description."
 
"Ah. And had anyone else noticed it?"
 
"Apparently not. And no one was  able  to  get  a  very  detailed
description  from  him,  so  only the most perfunctory search was
made."
 
"And what happened to the man?"
 
"Well, I think someone offered to take him off and give him  some
lunch,  but he explained that he'd already had a rather good one,
so the matter was dropped and Warwickshire  went  on  to  win  by
three wickets."
 
"So, not very like this current instance. For those of you who've
just  tuned  in,  you  may be interested to know that, er ... two
men, two rather scruffily attired men, and  indeed  a  sofa  -  a
Chesterfield I think?"
 
"Yes, a Chesterfield."
 
"Have just materialized here in  the  middle  of  Lord's  Cricket
Ground.  But I don't think they meant any harm, they've been very
good-natured about it, and ..."
 
"Sorry, can I interrupt you a moment Peter and say that the  sofa
has just vanished."
 
"So it has. Well, that's one mystery less. Still, it's definitely
one  for the record books I think, particularly occurring at this
dramatic moment in play, England  now  needing  only  twenty-four
runs  to  win  the  series.  The men are leaving the pitch in the
company of a police officer, and I think everyone's settling down
now and play is about to resume."
 
"Now, sir," said the policeman after  they  had  made  a  passage
through the curious crowd and laid Arthur's peacefully inert body
on a blanket, "perhaps you'd care to tell me who you  are,  where
you come from, and what that little scene was all about?"
 
Ford looked at the ground for a moment as  if  steadying  himself
for  something,  then  he straightened up and aimed a look at the
policeman which hit him with the full force of every inch of  the
six  hundred  light-years' distance between Earth and Ford's home
near Betelgeuse.
 
"All right," said Ford, very quietly, "I'll tell you."
 
"Yes,  well,  that  won't  be  necessary,"  said  the   policeman
hurriedly,  "just  don't  let whatever  it was happen again." The
policeman turned around and wandered off in search of anyone  who
wasn't from Betelgeuse. Fortunately, the ground was full of them.
 
Arthur's consciousness  approached  his  body  as  from  a  great
distance,  and  reluctantly.  It had had some bad times in there.
Slowly,  nervously,  it  entered  and  settled  down  in  to  its
accustomed position.
 
Arthur sat up.
 
"Where am I?" he said.
 
"Lord's Cricket Ground," said Ford.
 
"Fine," said Arthur, and his consciousness stepped out again  for
a quick breather. His body flopped back on the grass.
 
Ten minutes later, hunched over a cup of tea in  the  refreshment
tent, the colour started to come back to his haggard face.
 
"How're you feeling?" said Ford.
 
"I'm home," said Arthur hoarsely. He closed his eyes and greedily
inhaled  the  steam  from  his tea as if it was - well, as far as
Arthur was concerned, as if it was tea, which it was.
 
"I'm home," he repeated, "home. It's  England,  it's  today,  the
nightmare is over." He opened his eyes again and smiled serenely.
"I'm where I belong," he said in an emotional whisper.
 
"There are two things I fell which I should tell you," said Ford,
tossing a copy of the Guardian over the table at him.
 
"I'm home," said Arthur.
 
"Yes," said Ford. "One is," he said pointing at the date  at  the
top of the paper, "that the Earth will be demolished in two days'
time."
 
"I'm home," said Arthur. "Tea," he said, "cricket," he added with
pleasure,  "mown grass, wooden benches, white linen jackets, beer
cans ..."
 
Slowly he began to focus on the newspaper. He cocked his head  on
one side with a slight frown.
 
"I've seen that one before," he said. His eyes wandered slowly up
to the date, which Ford was idly tapping at. His face froze for a
second or two and then began to do that  terribly  slow  crashing
trick which Arctic ice-floes do so spectacularly in the spring.
 
"And the other thing," said Ford, "is that you appear to  have  a
bone in your beard." He tossed back his tea.
 
Outside the refreshment tent, the sun  was  shining  on  a  happy
crowd.  It  shone  on  white  hats and red faces. It shone on ice
lollies and melted them. It shone on the tears of small  children
whose  ice  lollies  had just melted and fallen off the stick. It
shone on the trees, it flashed  off  whirling  cricket  bats,  it
gleamed  off  the  utterly  extraordinary object which was parked
behind the  sight-screens  and  which  nobody  appeared  to  have
noticed.  It  beamed  on Ford and Arthur as they emerged blinking
from the refreshment tent and surveyed the scene around them.
 
Arthur was shaking.
 
"Perhaps," he said, "I should ..."
 
"No," said Ford sharply.
 
"What?" said Arthur.
 
"Don't try and phone yourself up at home."
 
"How did you know ...?"
 
Ford shrugged.
 
"But why not?" said Arthur.
 
"People who talk to themselves on the phone," said  Ford,  "never
learn anything to their advantage."
 
"But ..."
 
"Look," said Ford. He picked up an imaginary phone and dialled an
imaginary dial.
 
"Hello?" he said into the imaginary mouthpiece. "Is  that  Arthur
Dent?  Ah,  hello,  yes. This is Arthur Dent speaking. Don't hang
up."
 
He looked at the imaginary mouthpiece in disappointment.
 
"He hung up," he said, shrugged,  and  put  the  imaginary  phone
neatly back on its imaginary hook.
 
"This is not my first temporal anomaly," he added.
 
A glummer look replaced the already glum look  on  Arthur  Dent's
face.
 
"So we're not home and dry," he said.
 
"We could not even be  said,"  replied  Ford,  "to  be  home  and
vigorously towelling ourselves off."
 
The game continued. The bowler approached the wicket at a lope, a
trot,  and  then  a run. He suddenly exploded in a flurry of arms
and legs, out of  which  flew  a  ball.  The  batsman  swung  and
thwacked  it  behind  him  over  the  sight-screens.  Ford's eyes
followed the trajectory of the ball and  jogged  momentarily.  He
stiffened.  He looked along the flight path of the ball again and
his eyes twitched again.
 
"This isn't my towel," said Arthur,  who  was  rummaging  in  his
rabbit-skin bag.
 
"Shhh," said Ford. He screwed his eyes up in concentration.
 
"I had a Golgafrinchan jogging towel," continued Arthur, "it  was
blue with yellow stars on it. This isn't it."
 
"Shhh," said Ford again. He covered one eye and looked  with  the
other.
 
"This one's pink," said Arthur, "it isn't yours is it?"
 
"I would like you to shut up about your towel," said Ford.
 
"It isn't my towel," insisted Arthur, "that is  the  point  I  am
trying to ..."
 
"And the time at which I would like you to  shut  up  about  it,"
continued Ford in a low growl, "is now."
 
"All right," said Arthur, starting to  stuff  it  back  into  the
primitively  stitched  rabbit-skin  bag.  "I  realize  that it is
probably not important in the cosmic scale of things,  it's  just
odd,  that's  all.  A  pink towel suddenly, instead of a blue one
with yellow stars."
 
Ford was beginning to behave  rather  strangely,  or  rather  not
actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in
a way which was strangely different from the other  strange  ways
in  which  he more regularly behaved. What he was doing was this.
Regardless of the bemused stares it was provoking from his fellow
members  of the crowd gathered round the pitch, he was waving his
hands in sharp movements across his  face,  ducking  down  behind
some  people,  leaping  up behind others, then standing still and
blinking a lot. After a moment or two of this he started to stalk
forward   slowly  and  stealthily  wearing  a  puzzled  frown  of
concentration, like a leopard that's not sure whether  it's  just
seen  a  half-empty tin of cat food half a mile away across a hot
and dusty plain.
 
"This isn't my bag either," said Arthur suddenly.
 
Ford's spell of concentration was broken. He  turned  angrily  on
Arthur.
 
"I  wasn't  talking  about  my  towel,"   said   Arthur.   "We've
established  that  that  isn't  mine. It's just that the bag into
which I was putting the towel which is not mine is also not mine,
though it is extraordinarily similar. Now personally I think that
that is extremely odd, especially as  the  bag  was  one  I  made
myself  on  prehistoric  Earth. These are also not my stones," he
added, pulling a few flat grey stones out  of  the  bag.  "I  was
making  a  collection of interesting stones and these are clearly
very dull ones."
 
A roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd  and  obliterated
whatever  it  was  that  Ford  said  in  reply  to  this piece of
information. The cricket ball which  had  excited  this  reaction
fell  out  of the sky and dropped neatly into Arthur's mysterious
rabbit-skin bag.
 
"Now I would say that that was also a very curious  event,"  said
Arthur,  rapidly  closing  the bag and pretending to look for the
ball on the ground.
 
"I don't think  it's  here,"  he  said  to  the  small  boys  who
immediately  clustered  round  him  to  join  in  the search, "it
probably rolled off somewhere. Over there I expect."  He  pointed
vaguely  in the direction in which he wished they would push off.
One of the boys looked at him quizzically.
 
"You all right?" said the boy.
 
"No," said Arthur.
 
"Then why you got a bone in your beard?" said the boy.
 
"I'm training it to like being wherever it's put." Arthur  prided
himself  on  saying this. It was, he thought, exactly the sort of
thing which would entertain and stimulate young minds.
 
"Oh," said the small boy,  putting  his  head  to  one  side  and
thinking about it. "What's your name?"
 
"Dent," said Arthur, "Arthur Dent."
 
"You're a jerk, Dent," said the boy, "a  complete  asshole."  The
boy  looked past him at something else, to show that he wasn't in
any  particular  hurry  to  run  away,  and  then  wandered   off
scratching  his  nose.  Suddenly Arthur remembered that the Earth
was going to be demolished again in two days' time, and just this
once didn't feel too bad about it.
 
Play resumed with a new ball, the sun continued to shine and Ford
continued to jump up and down shaking his head and blinking.
 
"Something's on your mind, isn't it?" said Arthur.
 
"I think," said Ford in a tone  of  voice  which  Arthur  by  now
recognized    as    one    which   presaged   something   utterly
unintelligible, "that there's an SEP over there."
 
He pointed. Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not
the  one  in  which  he  was  looking.  Arthur  looked in the one
direction, which was towards the sight-screens, and in the  other
which  was  at  the  field  of  play.  He nodded, he shrugged. He
shrugged again.
 
"A what?" he said.
 
"An SEP."
 
"An S ...?"
 
"... EP."
 
"And what's that?"
 
"Somebody Else's Problem."
 
"Ah, good," said Arthur and relaxed. He had no idea what all that
was about, but at least it seemed to be over. It wasn't.
 
"Over there," said Ford, again pointing at the sight-screens  and
looking at the pitch.
 
"Where?" said Arthur.
 
"There!" said Ford.
 
"I see," said Arthur, who didn't.
 
"You do?" said Ford.
 
"What?" said Arthur.
 
"Can you see," said Ford patiently, "the SEP?"
 
"I thought you said that was somebody else's problem."
 
"That's right."
 
Arthur nodded slowly,  carefully  and  with  an  air  of  immense
stupidity.
 
"And I want to know," said Ford, "if you can see it."
 
"You do?"
 
"Yes."
 
"What," said Arthur, "does it look like?"
 
"Well, how should I know, you fool?" shouted Ford.  "If  you  can
see it, you tell me."
 
Arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind  the
temples which was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with
Ford. His brain lurked like a frightened  puppy  in  its  kennel.
Ford took him by the arm.
 
"An SEP," he said, "is something that we can't see, or don't see,
or  our  brain  doesn't  let  us  see, because we think that it's
somebody else's problem. That's what SEP means.  Somebody  Else's
Problem.  The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot. If
you look at  it  directly  you  won't  see  it  unless  you  know
precisely  what  it is. Your only hope is to catch it by surprise
out of the corner of your eye."
 
"Ah," said Arthur, "then that's why ..."
 
"Yes," said Ford, who knew what Arthur was going to say.
 
"... you've been jumping up and ..."
 
"Yes."
 
"... down, and blinking ..."
 
"Yes."
 
"... and ..."
 
"I think you've got the message."
 
"I can see it," said Arthur, "it's a spaceship."
 
For a moment Arthur was stunned by the reaction  this  revelation
provoked. A roar erupted from the crowd, and from every direction
people were running, shouting, yelling, tumbling over each  other
in  a  tumult  of confusion. He stumbled back in astonishment and
glanced fearfully around. Then he glanced around  again  in  even
greater astonishment.
 
"Exciting, isn't it?" said an apparition. The apparition  wobbled
in  front  of  Arthur's  eyes,  though the truth of the matter is
probably that  Arthur's  eyes  were  wobbling  in  front  of  the
apparition. His mouth wobbled as well.
 
"W ... w ... w ... w ..." his mouth said.
 
"I think your team have just won," said the apparition.
 
"W ... w ... w ... w ..." repeated Arthur,  and  punctuated  each
wobble  with  a  prod at Ford Prefect's back. Ford was staring at
the tumult in trepidation.
 
"You are English, aren't you?" said the apparition.
 
"W ... w ... w ... w ... yes" said Arthur.
 
"Well, your team, as I say, have just won. The  match.  It  means
they  retain the Ashes. You must be very pleased. I must say, I'm
rather fond of cricket, though I  wouldn't  like  anyone  outside
this planet to hear me saying that. Oh dear no."
 
The apparition gave what looked  as  if  it  might  have  been  a
mischievous  grin,  but  it  was hard to tell because the sun was
directly behind him, creating a blinding halo round his head  and
illuminating  his  silver  hair  and  beard  in  a  way which was
awesome, dramatic and hard to reconcile with mischievous grins.
 
"Still," he said, "it'll all be over in a couple of  days,  won't
it?  Though  as  I said to you when we last met, I was very sorry
about that. Still, whatever will have been, will have been."
 
Arthur tried to speak, but  gave  up  the  unequal  struggle.  He
prodded Ford again.
 
"I thought something terrible had happened," said Ford, "but it's
just  the  end  of  the  game.  We  ought  to get out. Oh, hello,
Slartibartfast, what are you doing here?"
 
"Oh, pottering, pottering," said the old man gravely.
 
"That your ship? Can you give us a lift anywhere?"
 
"Patience, patience," the old man admonished.
 
"OK," said Ford. "It's  just  that  this  planet's  going  to  be
demolished pretty soon."
 
"I know that," said Slartibartfast.
 
"And, well, I just wanted to make that point," said Ford.
 
"The point is taken."
 
And if you feel that you really want to  hang  around  a  cricket
pitch at this point ..."
 
"I do."
 
"Then it's your ship."
 
"It is."
 
"I suppose." Ford turned away sharply at this point.
 
"Hello, Slartibartfast," said Arthur at last.
 
"Hello, Earthman," said Slartibartfast.
 
"After all," said Ford, "we can only die once."
 
The old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch,  with
eyes  that  seemed  alive  with  expressions that had no apparent
bearing on what was happening out there. What was  happening  was
that  the crowd was gathering itself into a wide circle round the
centre of the pitch. What Slartibartfast  saw  in  it,  he  alone
knew.
 
Ford was humming something. It was  just  one  note  repeated  at
intervals.  He was hoping that somebody would ask him what he was
humming, but nobody did. If anybody had asked him he  would  have
said  he  was humming the first line of a Noel Coward song called
"Mad About the Boy" over and over again. It would then have  been
pointed out to him that he was only singing one note, to which he
would have replied that for  reasons  which  he  hoped  would  be
apparent, he was omitting the "about the boy" bit. He was annoyed
that nobody asked.
 
"It's just," he burst out at last, "that if we don't go soon,  we
might  get  caught  in  the  middle  of it all again. And there's
nothing that  depresses  me  more  than  seeing  a  planet  being
destroyed.  Except  possibly  still  being on it when it happens.
Or," he added in an undertone, "hanging around cricket matches."
 
"Patience," said Slartibartfast again. "Great things are afoot."
 
"That's what you said last time we met," said Arthur.
 
"They were," said Slartibartfast.
 
"Yes, that's true," admitted Arthur.
 
All, however, that seemed to be afoot  was  a  ceremony  of  some
kind.  It was being specially staged for the benefit of tv rather
than the spectators, and all they  could  gather  about  it  from
where they were standing was what they heard from a nearby radio.
Ford was aggressively uninterested.
 
He fretted as he heard it explained that the Ashes were about  to
be  presented to the Captain of the English team out there on the
pitch, fumed when told that this was because  they  had  now  won
them  for  the  nth time, positively barked with annoyance at the
information that the Ashes were the remains of a  cricket  stump,
and  when, further to this, he was asked to contend with the fact
that the cricket stump in question had been burnt  in  Melbourne,
Australia, in 1882, to signify the "death of English cricket", he
rounded on Slartibartfast, took a deep breath, but didn't have  a
chance  to  say anything because the old man wasn't there. He was
marching out on to the pitch with terrible purpose in  his  gait,
his  hair, beard and robes swept behind him, looking very much as
Moses would have looked if Sinai had been a well-cut lawn instead
of, as it is more usually represented, a fiery smoking mountain.
 
"He said to meet him at his ship," said Arthur.
 
"What in the name of zarking fardwarks is the  old  fool  doing?"
exploded Ford.
 
"Meeting us at his ship in two minutes," said Arthur with a shrug
which  indicated  total  abdication  of thought. They started off
towards it. Strange sounds reached their ears. They tried not  to
listen,  but  could  not  help  noticing  that Slartibartfast was
querulously demanding that he be given the silver urn  containing
the  Ashes,  as  they  were,  he said, "vitally important for the
past, present and future safety of the Galaxy", and that this was
causing wild hilarity. They resolved to ignore it.
 
What happened next they could not ignore. With  a  noise  like  a
hundred  thousand  people  saying "wop", a steely white spaceship
suddenly seemed to create  itself  out  of  nothing  in  the  air
directly  above  the  cricket  pitch and hung there with infinite
menace and a slight hum.
 
Then for a while it did nothing, as if it expected  everybody  to
go  about  their  normal  business  and  not mind it just hanging
there.
 
Then it did something quite extraordinary. Or rather,  it  opened
up  and  let something quite extraordinary come out of it, eleven
quite extraordinary things.
 
They were robots, white robots.
 
What was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared  to
have come dressed for the occasion. Not only were they white, but
they carried what appeared to be cricket bats, and not only that,
but  they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls, and not
only that but they wore white ribbing pads round the lower  parts
of  their  legs.  These  last  were  extraordinary  because  they
appeared to contain jets which allowed these curiously  civilized
robots  to  fly  down  from their hovering spaceship and start to
kill people, which is what they did
 
"Hello," said Arthur, "something seems to be happening."
 
"Get to the ship," shouted Ford. "I don't want to know,  I  don't
want to see, I don't want to hear," he yelled as he ran, "this is
not my planet, I didn't choose to be here, I don't  want  to  get
involved,  just  get  me out of here, and get me to a party, with
people I can relate to!"
 
Smoke and flame billowed from the pitch.
 
"Well, the supernatural brigade certainly  seems  to  be  out  in
force here today ..." burbled a radio happily to itself.
 
"What I need," shouted Ford, by way of  clarifying  his  previous
remarks,  "is  a  strong drink and a peer-group." He continued to
run, pausing only for a moment to grab Arthur's arm and drag  him
along  with him. Arthur had adopted his normal crisis role, which
was to stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over
him.
 
"They're playing cricket," muttered Arthur, stumbling along after
Ford.  "I  swear they are playing cricket. I do not know why they
are doing this, but that is what they are doing. They're not just
killing  people,  they're  sending  them  up," he shouted, "Ford,
they're sending us up!"
 
It would have been hard to  disbelieve  this  without  knowing  a
great  deal  more Galactic history than Arthur had so far managed
to pick up in his travels. The ghostly but  violent  shapes  that
could  be seen moving within the thick pall of smoke seemed to be
performing a series of bizarre parodies of batting  strokes,  the
difference  being  that  every  ball  they struck with their bats
exploded wherever it landed. The very  first  one  of  these  had
dispelled  Arthur's  initial reaction, that the whole thing might
just be a publicity stunt by Australian margarine manufacturers.
 
And then, as suddenly as it had all started,  it  was  over.  The
eleven  white  robots  ascended  through  the seething cloud in a
tight formation, and with a few last flashes of flame entered the
bowels  of  their hovering white ship, which, with the noise of a
hundred thousand people saying "foop", promptly vanished into the
thin air out of which it had wopped.
 
For a moment there was a terrible stunned silence, and  then  out
of  the  drifting smoke emerged the pale figure of Slartibartfast
looking even more like Moses because in spite  of  the  continued
absence  of  the  mountain  he was at least now striding across a
fiery and smoking well-mown lawn.
 
He stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying  figures  of
Arthur  Dent  and  Ford  Prefect  forcing  their  way through the
frightened crowd which was for the moment busy stampeding in  the
opposite  direction.  The  crowd  was  clearly thinking to itself
about what an unusual day this was turning out  to  be,  and  not
really knowing which way, if any, to turn.
 
Slartibartfast was gesturing urgently  at  Ford  and  Arthur  and
shouting at them, as the three of them gradually converged on his
ship, still parked behind the sight-screens and still  apparently
unnoticed  by  the  crowd  stampeding  past it who presumably had
enough of their own problems to cope with at that time.
 
"They've garble warble farble!"  shouted  Slartibartfast  in  his
thin tremulous voice.
 
"What did he say?" panted Ford as he elbowed his way onwards.
 
Arthur shook his head.
 
"`They've ...' something or other," he said.
 
"They've table warble farble!" shouted Slartibartfast again.
 
Ford and Arthur shook their heads at each other.
 
"It sounds urgent," said Arthur. He stopped and shouted.
 
"What?"
 
"They've  garble  warble  fashes!"  cried  Slartibartfast,  still
waving at them.
 
"He says," said Arthur, "that they've taken the  Ashes.  That  is
what I think he says." They ran on.
 
"The ...?" said Ford.
 
"Ashes," said Arthur tersely. "The burnt  remains  of  a  cricket
stump.  It's  a  trophy.  That  ..."  he  was  panting,  "is  ...
apparently ... what they ... have come and taken." He  shook  his
head very slightly as if he was trying to get his brain to settle
down lower in his skull.
 
"Strange thing to want to tell us," snapped Ford.
 
"Strange thing to take."
 
"Strange ship."
 
They had arrived at it. The second strangest thing about the ship
was  watching  the  Somebody  Else's  Problem field at work. They
could now clearly see the ship for what  it  was  simply  because
they  knew  it  was  there.  It was quite apparent, however, that
nobody else could. This wasn't because it was actually  invisible
or  anything  hyper-impossible like that. The technology involved
in making anything invisible is so infinitely complex  that  nine
hundred  and  ninety-nine  thousand  million,  nine  hundred  and
ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand,  nine
hundred and ninety-nine times out of a billion it is much simpler
and more effective just to take the thing away and do without it.
The  ultra-famous  sciento-magician  Effrafax of Wug once bet his
life that, given a year, he could render the  great  megamountain
Magramal entirely invisible.
 
Having spent most of the year jiggling around with  immense  Lux-
O-Valves and Refracto-Nullifiers and Spectrum-Bypass-O-Matics, he
realized, with nine hours to go, that he wasn't going to make it.
 
So, he and  his  friends,  and  his  friends'  friends,  and  his
friends'  friends'  friends,  and  his friends' friends' friends'
friends, and some rather less good friends of theirs who happened
to  own  a  major  stellar  trucking  company, put in what now is
widely recognized as being the hardest night's work  in  history,
and,  sure  enough,  on the following day, Magramal was no longer
visible. Effrafax lost his bet - and therefore his life -  simply
because some pedantic adjudicating official noticed (a) that when
walking around the area that Magramal ought to be he didn't  trip
over  or break his nose on anything, and (b) a suspicious-looking
extra moon.
 
The Somebody Else's  Problem  field  is  much  simpler  and  more
effective, and what's more can be run for over a hundred years on
a single torch battery. This is because  it  relies  on  people's
natural  disposition  not  to  see  anything  they don't want to,
weren't expecting, or can't explain. If Effrafax had painted  the
mountain  pink  and  erected  a  cheap and simple Somebody Else's
Problem field on it, then  people  would  have  walked  past  the
mountain,  round  it, even over it, and simply never have noticed
that the thing was there.
 
And this is precisely what was  happening  with  Slartibartfast's
ship.  It  wasn't  pink, but if it had been, that would have been
the least of its visual problems and people were simply  ignoring
it like anything.
 
The most extraordinary thing about it was  that  it  looked  only
partly  like  a  spaceship with guidance fins, rocket engines and
escape hatches and so on, and a great deal like a  small  upended
Italian bistro.
 
Ford and Arthur  gazed  up  at  it  with  wonderment  and  deeply
offended sensibilities.
 
"Yes, I know," said Slartibartfast, hurrying up to them  at  that
point,  breathless and agitated, "but there is a reason. Come, we
must go. The ancient nightmare is come again. Doom  confronts  us
all. We must leave at once."
 
"I fancy somewhere sunny," said Ford.
 
Ford and Arthur followed Slartibartfast into the ship and were so
perplexed  by  what  they  saw  inside  it that they were totally
unaware of what happened next outside.
 
A spaceship, yet another one, but  this  one  sleek  and  silver,
descended  from  the  sky on to the pitch, quietly, without fuss,
its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology.
 
It landed gently. It extended a short  ramp.  A  tall  grey-green
figure  marched  briskly  out  and  approached  the small knot of
people who were gathered in the centre of the  pitch  tending  to
the  casualties  of  the recent bizarre massacre. It moved people
aside with quiet, understated authority, and came at  last  to  a
man  lying  in  a desperate pool of blood, clearly now beyond the
reach of any Earthly medicine, breathing, coughing his last.  The
figure knelt down quietly beside him.
 
"Arthur Philip Deodat?" asked the figure.
 
The man, with horrified confusion in eyes, nodded feebly.
 
"You're a no-good dumbo  nothing,"  whispered  the  creature.  "I
thought you should know that before you went."

(Reproduced from the Siderial Daily Mentioner's Book  of  popular
Galactic History.)
 
Since this  Galaxy  began,  vast  civilizations  have  risen  and
fallen,  risen  and  fallen,  risen and fallen so often that it's
quite tempting to think that life in the Galaxy must be
 
(a) something akin to seasick - space-sick,  time  sick,  history
sick or some such thing, and
 
(b) stupid.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 6
 
It seemed to Arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside
and let them through.
 
It seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the
cosmos were streaming through each other.
 
It seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of  the  Universe,
and that the wind was him.
 
It seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the  Universe
and that the Universe was a thought of his.
 
It seemed to the people at Lord's  Cricket  Ground  that  another
North  London  restaurant had just come and gone as they so often
do, and that this was Somebody Else's Problem.
 
"What happened?" whispered Arthur in considerable awe.
 
"We took off," said Slartibartfast.
 
Arthur lay in startled stillness on the  acceleration  couch.  He
wasn't   certain  whether  he  had  just  got  space-sickness  or
religion.
 
"Nice mover," said Ford in an unsuccessful  attempt  to  disguise
the   degree   to   which   he   had   been   impressed  by  what
Slartibartfast's ship had just done, "shame about the decor."
 
For a moment or two the old man didn't reply. He was  staring  at
the  instruments  with  the  air  of one who is trying to convert
fahrenheit to centigrade in his head whilst his house is  burning
down.  Then  his  brow  cleared and he stared for a moment at the
wide  panoramic  screen  in  front  of  him,  which  displayed  a
bewildering  complexity  of  stars  streaming like silver threads
around them.
 
His lips moved as if he was trying to spell  something.  Suddenly
his  eyes  darted  in alarm back to his instruments, but then his
expression merely subsided into a steady frown. He looked back up
at  the  screen.  He felt his own pulse. His frown deepened for a
moment, then he relaxed.
 
"It's a mistake to try  and  understand  mathematics,"  he  said,
"they only worry me. What did you say?"
 
"Decor," said Ford. "Pity about it."
 
"Deep in the  fundamental  heart  of  mind  and  Universe,"  said
Slartibartfast, "there is a reason."
 
Ford glanced sharply around. He clearly thought this  was  taking
an optimistic view of things.
 
The interior of the flight deck was dark green,  dark  red,  dark
brown,  cramped and moodily lit. Inexplicably, the resemblance to
a small Italian bistro had failed to end at the  hatchway.  Small
pools  of light picked out pot plants, glazed tiles and all sorts
of little unidentifiable brass things.
 
Rafia-wrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows.
 
The instruments which  had  occupied  Slartibartfast's  attention
seemed  to  be mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in
concrete.
 
Ford reached out and touched it.
 
Fake concrete. Plastic. Fake bottles set in fake concrete.
 
The fundamental heart of mind and Universe  can  take  a  running
jump,  he thought to himself, this is rubbish. On the other hand,
it could not be denied that the way the ship had moved  made  the
Heart of Gold seem like an electric pram.
 
He swung himself off the  couch.  He  brushed  himself  down.  He
looked at Arthur who was singing quietly to himself. He looked at
the screen and recognized nothing. He looked at Slartibartfast.
 
"How far did we just travel?" he said.
 
"About ..." said Slartibartfast, "about two  thirds  of  the  way
across  the Galactic disc, I would say, roughly. Yes, roughly two
thirds, I think."
 
"It's a strange thing," said Arthur quietly,  "that  the  further
and  faster  one  travels  across  the  Universe,  the more one's
position in it seems to be largely immaterial, and one is  filled
with a profound, or rather emptied of a ..."
 
"Yes, very strange," said Ford. "Where are we going?"
 
"We are going," said  Slartibartfast,  "to  confront  an  ancient
nightmare of the Universe."
 
"And where are you going to drop us off?"
 
"I will need your help."
 
"Tough. Look, there's somewhere you can take us where we can have
fun, I'm trying to think of it, we can get drunk and maybe listen
to some extremely evil music. Hold on, I'll look it up."  He  dug
out  his copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and tipped
through those parts of the index primarily concerned with sex and
drugs and rock and roll.
 
"A curse has arisen from the mists of time," said Slartibartfast.
 
"Yes,  I  expect  so,"  said  Ford.  "Hey,"  he  said,   lighting
accidentally  on  one  particular  reference  entry,  "Eccentrica
Gallumbits, did you ever meet her? The triple-breasted  whore  of
Eroticon Six. Some people say her erogenous zones start some four
miles from her actual body. Me, I disagree, I say five."
 
"A curse," said Slartibartfast, "which will engulf the Galaxy  in
fire  and  destruction,  and  possibly  bring  the  Universe to a
premature doom. I mean it," he added.
 
"Sounds like a bad time," said Ford, "with  look  I'll  be  drunk
enough  not to notice. Here," he said, stabbing his finger at the
screen of the Guide, "would be a really wicked place to go, and I
think  we  should. What do you say, Arthur? Stop mumbling mantras
and pay attention. There's important stuff you're missing here."
 
Arthur pushed himself up from his couch and shook his head.
 
"Where are we going?" he said.
 
"To confront an ancient night-"
 
"Can it," said Ford. "Arthur, we are going out into the Galaxy to
have some fun. Is that an idea you can cope with?"
 
"What's Slartibartfast looking so anxious about?" said Arthur.
 
"Nothing," said Ford.
 
"Doom,"  said  Slartibartfast.  "Come,"  he  added,  with  sudden
authority, "there is much I must show and tell you."
 
He walked towards  a  green  wrought-iron  spiral  staircase  set
incomprehensibly  in the middle of the flight deck and started to
ascend. Arthur, with a frown, followed.
 
Ford slung the Guide sullenly back into his satchel.
 
"My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland  and  a
natural  deficiency in moral fibre," he muttered to himself, "and
that I am therefore excused from saving Universes."
 
Nevertheless, he stomped up the stairs behind them.
 
What they found upstairs was just stupid, or so  it  seemed,  and
Ford  shook  his  head,  buried his face in his hands and slumped
against a pot plant, crushing it against the wall.
 
"The   central   computational   area,"    said    Slartibartfast
unperturbed,  "this is where every calculation affecting the ship
in any way is performed. Yes I know what it looks like, but it is
in  fact a complex four-dimensional topographical map of a series
of highly complex mathematical functions."
 
"It looks like a joke," said Arthur.
 
"I know what it looks like," said Slartibartfast, and  went  into
it.  As  he  did  so,  Arthur had a sudden vague flash of what it
might mean, but he refused to believe it. The Universe could  not
possibly  work  like  that, he thought, cannot possibly. That, he
thought to himself, would be as absurd as ... he terminated  that
line of thinking. Most of the really absurd things he could think
of had already happened.
 
And this was one of them.
 
It was a large glass cage, or box - in fact a room.
 
In it was a table, a long one. Around it were  gathered  about  a
dozen  chairs,  of the bentwood style. On it was a tablecloth - a
grubby,  red  and  white  check  tablecloth,  scarred  with   the
occasional   cigarette  burn,  each,  presumably,  at  a  precise
calculated mathematical position.
 
And on the tablecloth sat some half-eaten Italian  meals,  hedged
about with half-eaten breadsticks and half-drunk glasses of wine,
and toyed with listlessly by robots.
 
It was  all  completely  artificial.  The  robot  customers  were
attended  by  a  robot  waiter,  a  robot wine waiter and a robot
maetre  d'.  The  furniture  was   artificial,   the   tablecloth
artificial, and each particular piece of food was clearly capable
of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics of, say, a pollo
sorpreso, without actually being one.
 
And all participated in a  little  dance  together  -  a  complex
routine  involving the manipulation of menus, bill pads, wallets,
cheque books, credit cards, watches, pencils and  paper  napkins,
which  seemed  to be hovering constantly on the edge of violence,
but never actually getting anywhere.
 
Slartibartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time  of
day  quite  idly  with  the maetre d', whilst one of the customer
robots, an autorory, slid slowly under the table, mentioning what
he intended to do to some guy over some girl.
 
Slartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and
passed a shrewd eye over the menu. The tempo of the routine round
the table seemed  somehow  imperceptibly  to  quicken.  Arguments
broke  out,  people  attempted  to  prove things on napkins. They
waved fiercely at each  other,  and  attempted  to  examine  each
other's pieces of chicken. The waiter's hand began to move on the
bill pad more quickly than a human hand could  manage,  and  then
more quickly than a human eye could follow. The pace accelerated.
Soon, an extraordinary and insistent politeness  overwhelmed  the
group, and seconds later it seemed that a moment of consensus was
suddenly achieved. A new vibration thrilled through the ship.
 
Slartibartfast emerged from the glass room.
 
"Bistromathics," he said. "The most powerful computational  force
known   to   parascience.  Come  to  the  Room  of  Informational
Illusions."
 
He swept past and carried them bewildered in his wake.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 7
 
The Bistromatic Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing  vast
interstellar  distances  without all that dangerous mucking about
with Improbability Factors.
 
Bistromathics  itself  is  simply  a  revolutionary  new  way  of
understanding the behaviour of numbers. Just as Einstein observed
that time was not an absolute  but  depended  on  the  observer's
movement  in  space,  and  that  space  was  not an absolute, but
depended on the  observer's  movement  in  time,  so  it  is  now
realized  that  numbers  are  not  absolute,  but  depend  on the
observer's movement in restaurants.
 
The first non-absolute number is the number of  people  for  whom
the  table  is  reserved. This will vary during the course of the
first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then  bear  no
apparent  relation  to the number of people who actually turn up,
or to the number of people who subsequently join them  after  the
show/match/party/gig,  or  to the number of people who leave when
they see who else has turned up.
 
The second non-absolute number is  the  given  time  of  arrival,
which   is  now  known  to  be  one  of  those  most  bizarre  of
mathematical concepts,  a  recipriversexcluson,  a  number  whose
existence  can  only  be  defined  as  being  anything other than
itself. In other words, the given time  of  arrival  is  the  one
moment  of  time at which it is impossible that any member of the
party will arrive. Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part  in
many  branches of maths, including statistics and accountancy and
also form the basic  equations  used  to  engineer  the  Somebody
Else's Problem field.
 
The third and most mysterious piece of  non-absoluteness  of  all
lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill,
the cost of each item, the number of people  at  the  table,  and
what they are each prepared to pay for. (The number of people who
have actually brought any money is only a sub-phenomenon in  this
field.)
 
The baffling discrepancies which used  to  occur  at  this  point
remained  uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took
them seriously. They were at the time put down to such things  as
politeness,    rudeness,    meanness,    flashness,    tiredness,
emotionality,  or  the  lateness  of  the  hour,  and  completely
forgotten  about on the following morning. They were never tested
under  laboratory  conditions,  of  course,  because  they  never
occurred  in  laboratories  -  not  in  reputable laboratories at
least.
 
And so it was only with the advent of pocket computers  that  the
startling truth became finally apparent, and it was this:
 
Numbers written  on  restaurant  bills  within  the  confines  of
restaurants  do  not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers
written on any other pieces of paper in any other  parts  of  the
Universe.
 
This  single  fact  took  the  scientific  world  by  storm.   It
completely  revolutionized  it.  So many mathematical conferences
got held in such good restaurants that many of the  finest  minds
of a generation died of obesity and heart failure and the science
of maths was put back by years.
 
Slowly, however,  the  implications  of  the  idea  began  to  be
understood.  To  begin with it had been too stark, too crazy, too
much what the man in the street would have said, "Oh yes, I could
have  told  you that," about. Then some phrases like "Interactive
Subjectivity Frameworks" were invented, and everybody was able to
relax and get on with it.
 
The small groups of monks who had taken  up  hanging  around  the
major  research  institutes  singing strange chants to the effect
that the Universe was only a figment of its own imagination  were
eventually given a street theatre grant and went away.

Chapter 8
 
"In space travel, you see," said Slartibartfast,  as  he  fiddled
with some instruments in the Room of Informational Illusions, "in
space travel ..."
 
He stopped and looked about him.
 
The Room of Informational Illusions was a  welcome  relief  after
the visual monstrosities of the central computational area. There
was nothing in it. No information, no illusions, just themselves,
white  walls  and a few small instruments which looked as if they
were meant to plug into something which  Slartibartfast  couldn't
find.
 
"Yes?" urged Arthur. He had picked up Slartibartfast's  sense  of
urgency but didn't know what to do with it.
 
"Yes what?" said the old man.
 
"You were saying?"
 
Slartibartfast looked at him sharply.
 
"The numbers," he said, "are awful." He resumed his search.
 
Arthur nodded wisely to himself. After a while he  realized  that
this  wasn't  getting  him anywhere and decided that he would say
"what?" after all.
 
"In space travel," repeated Slartibartfast, "all the numbers  are
awful."
 
Arthur nodded again and looked round to Ford for help,  but  Ford
was practising being sullen and getting quite good at it.
 
"I was only," said Slartibartfast with a sigh,  "trying  to  save
you the trouble of asking me why all the ship's computations were
being done on a waiter's bill pad."
 
Arthur frowned.
 
"Why," he said, "were all the ship's computations being done on a
wait-"
 
He stopped.
 
Slartibartfast said, "Because in space travel all the numbers are
awful."
 
He could tell that he wasn't getting his point across.
 
"Listen," he said. "On a waiter's bill  pad  numbers  dance.  You
must have encountered the phenomenon."
 
"Well ..."
 
"On a waiter's  bill  pad,"  said  Slartibartfast,  "reality  and
unreality  collide  on such a fundamental level that each becomes
the other and anything is possible, within certain parameters."
 
"What parameters?"
 
"It's impossible to say," said  Slartibartfast.  "That's  one  of
them.  Strange  but  true.  At  least,  I think it's strange," he
added, "and I'm assured that it's true."
 
At that moment he located the slot in the wall for which  he  had
been  searching,  and  clicked the instrument he was holding into
it.
 
"Do not be alarmed," he said, and then suddenly darted an alarmed
look at himself, and lunged back, "it's ..."
 
They didn't hear what he said, because at that  moment  the  ship
winked  out  of  existence  around them and a starbattle-ship the
size of a small Midlands  industrial  city  plunged  out  of  the
sundered night towards them, star lasers ablaze.
 
They gaped, pop-eyed, and were unable to scream.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 9
 
Another world, another day, another dawn.
 
The early morning's thinnest sliver of light appeared silently.
 
Several billion trillion  tons  of  superhot  exploding  hydrogen
nuclei  rose  slowly above the horizon and managed to look small,
cold and slightly damp.
 
There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there  is  the
possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath.
 
The moment passed as it regularly  did  on  Squornshellous  Zeta,
without incident.
 
The mist clung to the surface of the  marshes.  The  swamp  trees
were  grey with it, the tall reeds indistinct. It hung motionless
like held breath.
 
Nothing moved.
 
There was silence.
 
The sun struggled feebly with the mist, tried to impart a  little
warmth  here,  shed  a  little light there, but clearly today was
going to be just another long haul across the sky.
 
Nothing moved.
 
Again, silence.
 
Nothing moved.
 
Silence.
 
Very often on Squornshellous Zeta, whole days would  go  on  like
this, and this was indeed going to be one of them.
 
Fourteen hours later the sun sank hopelessly beneath the opposite
horizon with a sense of totally wasted effort.
 
And a few hours later it reappeared, squared  its  shoulders  and
started on up the sky again.
 
This time, however, something was happening. A mattress had  just
met a robot.
 
"Hello, robot," said the mattress.
 
"Bleah," said the robot and continued what it  was  doing,  which
was walking round very slowly in a very tiny circle.
 
"Happy?" said the mattress.
 
The robot stopped and looked at the mattress.  It  looked  at  it
quizzically.  It  was  clearly  a very stupid mattress. It looked
back at him with wide eyes.
 
After what it had calculated to ten significant decimal places as
being the precise length of pause most likely to convey a general
contempt for all things mattressy, the robot  continued  to  walk
round in tight circles.
 
"We could have a conversation," said  the  mattress,  "would  you
like that?"
 
It was a large mattress, and probably one of quite high  quality.
Very  few things actually get manufactured these days, because in
an infinitely large Universe such as, for instance,  the  one  in
which  we live, most things one could possibly imagine, and a lot
of things one would rather not,  grow  somewhere.  A  forest  was
discovered  recently  in  which  most  of  the trees grew ratchet
screwdrivers as fruit.  The life  cycle  of  ratchet  screwdriver
fruit  it  quite  interesting.  Once picked it needs a dark dusty
drawer in which it can lie undisturbed for years. Then one  night
it  suddenly hatches, discards its outer skin which crumbles into
dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable little metal object
with  flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of hole
for a screw. This, when found, will get thrown away. No one knows
what  it  is  supposed to gain from this. Nature, in her infinite
wisdom, is presumably working on it.
 
No one really knows what mattresses are meant to gain from  their
lives  either.  They are large, friendly, pocket-sprung creatures
which live quiet private lives in the marshes  of  Squornshellous
Zeta.  Many  of  them get caught, slaughtered, dried out, shipped
out and slept on. None of them seem to mind and all of  them  are
called Zem.
 
"No," said Marvin.
 
"My name," said the mattress,  "is  Zem.  We  could  discuss  the
weather a little."
 
Marvin paused again in his weary circular plod.
 
"The dew," he observed, "has clearly fallen with  a  particularly
sickening thud this morning."
 
He resumed his  walk,  as  if  inspired  by  this  conversational
outburst  to  fresh  heights of gloom and despondency. He plodded
tenaciously. If he had had teeth he would have  gritted  them  at
this point. He hadn't. He didn't. The mere plod said it all.
 
The mattress flolloped around. This is a  thing  that  only  live
mattresses in swamps are able to do, which is why the word is not
in more common usage. It flolloped in a sympathetic  sort of way,
moving  a  fairish  body  of  water  as  it did so. It blew a few
bubbles up through the  water  engagingly.  Its  blue  and  white
stripes  glistened briefly in a sudden feeble ray of sun that had
unexpectedly made it through the mist, causing  the  creature  to
bask momentarily.
 
Marvin plodded.
 
"You have something on your mind, I  think,"  said  the  mattress
floopily.
 
"More  than  you  can  possibly  imagine,"  dreaded  Marvin.  "My
capacity  for mental activity of all kinds is as boundless as the
infinite reaches  of  space  itself.  Except  of  course  for  my
capacity for happiness."
 
Stomp, stomp, he went.
 
"My capacity for happiness," he added,  "you  could  fit  into  a
matchbox without taking out the matches first."
 
The mattress globbered. This is the noise made by a live,  swamp-
dwelling  mattress  that  is  deeply moved by a story of personal
tragedy. The word  can  also,  according  to  The  Ultra-Complete
Maximegalon  Dictionary  of  Every  Language Ever, mean the noise
made by the Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop on discovering that he
has  forgotten  his  wife's birthday for the second year running.
Since there was only ever one Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop, and
he  never  married,  the  word is only ever used in a negative or
speculative sense,  and  there  is  an  ever-increasing  body  of
opinion   which   holds   that   The  Ultra-Complete  Maximegalon
Dictionary is not worth the fleet of lorries it takes to cart its
microstored  edition  around in. Strangely enough, the dictionary
omits the word "floopily", which simply means "in the  manner  of
something which is floopy".
 
The mattress globbered again.
 
"I sense a deep dejection in your diodes," it  vollued  (for  the
meaning  of  the  word  "vollue",  buy  a  copy of Squornshellous
Swamptalk at any remaindered bookshop, or alternatively  buy  The
Ultra-Complete  Maximegalon Dictionary, as the University will be
very glad to get it off their  hands  and  regain  some  valuable
parking   lots),   "and   it  saddens  me.  You  should  be  more
mattresslike. We live quiet retired lives in the swamp, where  we
are  content  to  flollop  and vollue and regard the wetness in a
fairly floopy manner. Some of us are killed, but all  of  us  are
called Zem, so we never know which and globbering is thus kept to
a minimum. Why are you walking in circles?"
 
"Because my leg is stuck," said Marvin simply.
 
"It seems to me," said the mattress  eyeing  it  compassionately,
"that it is a pretty poor sort of leg."
 
"You are right," said Marvin, "it is."
 
"Voon," said the mattress.
 
"I expect so," said Marvin, "and I also expect that you find  the
idea of a robot with an artificial leg pretty amusing. You should
tell your friends Zem and Zem when you see  them  later;  they'll
laugh,  if  I know them, which I don't of course - except insofar
as I know all organic life forms, which is  much  better  than  I
would wish to. Ha, but my life is but a box of wormgears."
 
He stomped around again in his tiny circle, around his thin steel
peg-leg which revolved in the mud but seemed otherwise stuck.
 
"But why do you just keep walking  round  and  round?"  said  the
mattress.
 
"Just to make the point," said Marvin, and continued,  round  and
round.
 
"Consider it  made,  my  dear  friend,"  flurbled  the  mattress,
"consider it made."
 
"Just another million years," said Marvin,  "just  another  quick
million. Then I might try it backwards. Just for the variety, you
understand."
 
The mattress could feel deep in his innermost spring pockets that
the robot dearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging
in this futile and  fruitless  manner,  and  with  another  quiet
flurble he did so.
 
"Oh, just over the one-point-five-million mark, just over,"  said
Marvin airily. "Ask me if I ever get bored, go on, ask me."
 
The mattress did.
 
Marvin  ignored  the  question,  he  merely  trudged  with  added
emphasis.
 
"I  gave  a  speech  once,"  he  said  suddenly,  and  apparently
unconnectedly. "You may not instantly see why I bring the subject
up, but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast, and I
am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than
you. Let me give you an example. Think of a number, any number."
 
"Er, five," said the mattress.
 
"Wrong," said Marvin. "You see?"
 
The mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it  was
in  the  presence  of a not unremarkable mind. It willomied along
its entire length, sending excited  little  ripples  through  its
shallow algae-covered pool.
 
It gupped.
 
"Tell me," it urged, "of the speech you once made, I long to hear
it."
 
"It was received very badly," said  Marvin,  "for  a  variety  of
reasons.  I  delivered  it," he added, pausing to make an awkward
humping sort of gesture with his not-exactly-good  arm,  but  his
arm which was better than the other one which was dishearteningly
welded to his left side, "over there, about a mile distance."
 
He was pointing as well as he  could  manage,  and  he  obviously
wanted to make it totally clear that this was as well as he could
manage, through the mist, over the reeds, to a part of the  marsh
which looked exactly the same as every other part of the marsh.
 
"There," he repeated. "I was  somewhat  of  a  celebrity  at  the
time."
 
Excitement gripped the mattress. It had never heard  of  speeches
being  delivered  on  Squornshellous  Zeta,  and certainly not by
celebrities. Water spattered off it as a thrill  glurried  across
its back.
 
It did something which  mattresses  very  rarely  bother  to  do.
Summoning  every  bit of its strength, it reared its oblong body,
heaved it up into the air and held it quivering there for  a  few
seconds  whilst  it peered through the mist over the reeds at the
part of the marsh which Marvin had indicated, observing,  without
disappointment,  that it was exactly the same as every other part
of the marsh. The effort was too much, and it flodged  back  into
its pool, deluging Marvin with smelly mud, moss and weeds.
 
"I was a celebrity," droned the robot sadly, "for a  short  while
on  account  of my miraculous and bitterly resented escape from a
fate almost as good as death in the heart of a blazing  sun.  You
can  guess  from  my  condition," he added, "how narrow my escape
was. I was rescued by a scrap-metal merchant, imagine that.  Here
I am, brain the size of ... never mind."
 
He trudged savagely for a few seconds.
 
"He it was who fixed me up with this leg. Hateful, isn't  it?  He
sold  me to a Mind Zoo. I was the star exhibit. I had to sit on a
box and tell my story whilst people told me to cheer up and think
positive. `Give us a grin, little robot,' they would shout at me,
`give us a little chuckle.' I would explain to them that  to  get
my  face  to  grin wold take a good couple of hours in a workshop
with a wrench, and that went down very well."
 
"The speech," urged the mattress. "I long to hear of  the  speech
you gave in the marshes."
 
"There was a bridge built across the marshes.  A  cyberstructured
hyperbridge,  hundreds  of  miles in length, to carry ion-buggies
and freighters over the swamp."
 
"A bridge?" quirruled the mattress. "Here in the swamp?"
 
"A bridge," confirmed Marvin, "here in the swamp. It was going to
revitalize  the  economy of the Squornshellous System. They spent
the entire economy of the Squornshellous System building it. They
asked me to open it. Poor fools."
 
It began to rain a little, a fine spray slid through the mist.
 
"I stood on the platform. For hundreds of miles in front  of  me,
and hundreds of miles behind me, the bridge stretched."
 
"Did it glitter?" enthused the mattress.
 
"It glittered."
 
"Did it span the miles majestically?"
 
"It spanned the miles majestically."
 
"Did it stretch like a silver thread far out into  the  invisible
mist?"
 
"Yes," said Marvin. "Do you want to hear this story?"
 
"I want to hear your speech," said the mattress.
 
"This is what I said. I said, `I would like to say that it  is  a
very  great  pleasure,  honour  and privilege for me to open this
bridge, but I can't because my lying  circuits  are  all  out  of
commission.  I  hate  and  despise  you  all.  I now declare this
hapless cyberstructure open to the unthinkable abuse of  all  who
wantonly  cross  her.'  And  I  plugged  myself  into the opening
circuits."
 
Marvin paused, remembering the moment.
 
The mattress flurred  and  glurried.  It  flolloped,  gupped  and
willomied, doing this last in a particularly floopy way.
 
"Voon," it wurfed at last. "And it was a magnificent occasion?"
 
"Reasonably magnificent.  The  entire  thousand-mile-long  bridge
spontaneously  folded  up  its  glittering spans and sank weeping
into the mire, taking everybody with it."
 
There was  a  sad  and  terrible  pause  at  this  point  in  the
conversation  during  which  a  hundred  thousand  people  seemed
unexpectedly to say "wop" and a team of  white  robots  descended
from  the  sky like dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight
military formation. For a sudden violent  moment  they  were  all
there,  in  the swamp, wrenching Marvin's false leg off, and then
they were gone again in their ship, which said "foop".
 
"You see the sort of thing I have to contend with?"  said  Marvin
to the gobbering mattress.
 
Suddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for  another
violent  incident, and this time when they left, the mattress was
alone in the swamp.  He  flolloped  around  in  astonishment  and
alarm.  He  almost lurgled in fear. He reared himself to see over
the reeds, but there was nothing to  see,  just  more  reeds.  He
listened,  but  there  was  no  sound  on the wind beyond the now
familiar sound of half-crazed etymologists calling  distantly  to
each other across the sullen mire.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 10
 
The body of Arthur Dent span.
 
The Universe shattered into a million glittering fragments around
it,  and  each  particular  shard span silently through the void,
reflecting on its silver surface some single searing holocaust of
fire and destruction.
 
And then the blackness behind the  Universe  exploded,  and  each
particular piece of blackness was the furious smoke of hell.
 
And the nothingness behind  the  blackness  behind  the  Universe
erupted,  and  behind the nothingness behind the blackness behind
the shattered Universe was at last the dark figure of an  immense
man speaking immense words.
 
"These, then,"  said  the  figure,  speaking  from  an  immensely
comfortable   chair,   "were   the  Krikkit  Wars,  the  greatest
devastation  ever  visited  upon  our  Galaxy.  What   you   have
experienced ..."
 
Slartibartfast floated past, waving.
 
"It's just a documentary," he called out. "This  is  not  a  good
bit. Terribly sorry, trying to find the rewind control ..."
 
"... is what billions of billions of innocent ..."
 
"Do not," called out  Slartibartfast  floating  past  again,  and
fiddling furiously with the thing that he had stuck into the wall
of the Room of Informational Illusions  and  which  was  in  fact
still stuck there, "agree to buy anything at this point."
 
"... people, creatures, your fellow beings ..."
 
Music swelled - again, it was immense music, immense chords.  And
behind the man, slowly, three tall pillars began to emerge out of
the immensely swirling mist.
 
"... experienced, lived through - or, more often, failed to  live
through.  Think  of that, my friends. And let us not forget - and
in just a moment I shall be able to suggest a way which will help
us  always to remember - that before the Krikkit Wars, the Galaxy
was that rare and wonderful thing a happy Galaxy!"
 
The music was going bananas with immensity at this point.
 
"A Happy Galaxy, my friends, as represented by the symbol of  the
Wikkit Gate!"
 
The three pillars stood out clearly  now,  three  pillars  topped
with two cross pieces in a way which looked stupefyingly familiar
to Arthur's addled brain.
 
"The three pillars," thundered the man. "The Steel  Pillar  which
represented the Strength and Power of the Galaxy!"
 
Searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and  down  the
pillar on the left which was, clearly, made of steel or something
very like it. The music thumped and bellowed.
 
"The Perspex Pillar," announced the man, "representing the forces
of Science and Reason in the Galaxy!"
 
Other searchlights played exotically up and down  the  righthand,
transparent  pillar  creating  dazzling  patterns within it and a
sudden inexplicable craving  for  ice-cream  in  the  stomach  of
Arthur Dent.
 
"And,"  the  thunderous  voice  continued,  "the  Wooden  Pillar,
representing  ..."  and  here his voice became just very slightly
hoarse with wonderful  sentiments,  "the  forces  of  Nature  and
Spirituality."
 
The lights picked out the central pillar. The music moved bravely
up into the realms of complete unspeakability.
 
"Between them supporting," the voice rolled on,  approaching  its
climax,  "the  Golden  Bail  of Prosperity and the Silver Bail of
Peace!"
 
The whole structure was now flooded with dazzling lights, and the
music  had  now,  fortunately,  gone far beyond the limits of the
discernible. At the top of the three pillars the two  brilliantly
gleaming  bails sat and dazzled. There seemed to be girls sitting
on top of them, or maybe they were meant to be angels. Angels are
usually represented as wearing more than that, though.
 
Suddenly there was a dramatic hush in what was  presumably  meant
to be the Cosmos, and a darkening of the lights.
 
"There is not a world," thrilled the man's expert voice,  "not  a
civilized  world  in  the Galaxy where this symbol is not revered
even today. Even  in  primitive  worlds  it  persists  in  racial
memories.  This  it was that the forces of Krikkit destroyed, and
this it is that now locks  their  world  away  till  the  end  of
eternity!"
 
And with a flourish, the man produced in his hands a model of the
Wikkit  gate.  Scale  was  terribly  hard  to judge in this whole
extraordinary spectacle, but the model looked as if it must  have
been about three feet high.
 
"Not the original key, of course. That, as  everyone  knows,  was
destroyed,  blasted  into  the ever-whirling eddies of the space-
time continuum and lost for ever. This is a  remarkable  replica,
hand-tooled   by  skilled  craftsmen,  lovingly  assembled  using
ancient craft secrets into a memento you will be proud to own, in
memory  of  those  who  fell,  and in tribute to the Galaxy - our
Galaxy - which they died to defend ..."
 
Slartibartfast floated past again at this moment.
 
"Found it," he said. "We can lose all this  rubbish.  Just  don't
nod, that's all."
 
"Now, let us bow our heads in payment," intoned  the  voice,  and
then said it again, much faster and backwards.
 
Lights came and went, the pillars  disappeared,  the  man  gabled
himself backwards into nothing, the Universe snappily reassembled
itself around them.
 
"You get the gist?" said Slartibartfast.
 
"I'm astonished," said Arthur, "and bewildered."
 
"I was asleep," said Ford, who floated into view at  this  point.
"Did I miss anything?"
 
They found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on  the
edge  of  an  agonizingly  high  cliff. The wind whipped out from
their faces and across a bay on which the remains of one  of  the
greatest  and most powerful space battle-fleets ever assembled in
the Galaxy was briskly burning itself back  into  existence.  The
sky  was  a sullen pink, darkening via a rather curious colour to
blue and upwards to black. Smoke billowed down out of  it  at  an
incredible lick.
 
Events were now passing back by them almost  too  quickly  to  be
distinguished,  and when, a short while later, a huge starbattle-
ship rushed away from them as if they'd  said  "boo",  they  only
just recognized it as the point at which they had come in.
 
But now things were too rapid, a video-tactile blur which brushed
and  jiggled them through centuries of galactic history, turning,
twisting, flickering. The sound was a mere thin thrill.
 
Periodically through the thickening jumble of events they  sensed
appalling  catastrophes,  deep  horrors,  cataclysmic shocks, and
these were always associated with certain recurring  images,  the
only  images  which  ever  stood out clearly from the avalance of
tumbling history: a wicket gate, a  small  hard  red  ball,  hard
white  robots,  and  also something less distinct, something dark
and cloudy.
 
But there was also another sensation which rose  clearly  out  of
the thrilling passage of time.
 
Just as a slow series of clicks when speeded  up  will  lose  the
definition  of  each  individual  click and gradually take on the
quality of a sustained and rising tone, so a series of individual
impressions here took on the quality of a sustained emotion - and
yet not an emotion. If it  was  an  emotion,  it  was  a  totally
emotionless  one.  It was hatred, implacable hatred. It was cold,
not like ice is cold, but like a wall is cold. It was impersonal,
not as a randomly flung fist in a crowd is impersonal, but like a
computer-issued parking summons is impersonal. And it was  deadly
- again, not like a bullet or a knife is deadly, but like a brick
wall across a motorway is deadly.
 
And just as a rising tone will change in character  and  take  on
harmonics  as it rises, so again, this emotionless emotion seemed
to rise to an unbearable if unheard scream and suddenly seemed to
be a scream of guilt and failure.
 
And suddenly it stopped.
 
They were left standing on a quiet hilltop on a tranquil evening.
 
The sun was setting.
 
All around them softly undulating green  countryside  rolled  off
gently  into  the distance. Birds sang about what they thought of
it all, and the general opinion seemed to be good. A  little  way
away  could  be heard the sound of children playing, and a little
further away than the apparent source of that sound could be seen
in the dimming evening light the outlines of a small town.
 
The town appeared to consist mostly of fairly low buildings  made
of white stone. The skyline was of gentle pleasing curves.
 
The sun had nearly set.
 
As if out of nowhere, music began.  Slartibartfast  tugged  at  a
switch and it stopped.
 
A voice said, "This ..." Slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it
stopped.
 
"I will tell you about it," he said quietly.
 
The place was peaceful.  Arthur  felt  happy.  Even  Ford  seemed
cheerful.  They  walked a short way in the direction of the town,
and the Informational Illusion of  the  grass  was  pleasant  and
springy  under  their feet, and the Informational Illusion of the
flowers smelt sweet  and  fragrant.  Only  Slartibartfast  seemed
apprehensive and out of sorts.
 
He stopped and looked up.
 
It suddenly occurred to Arthur that, coming as this  did  at  the
end,  so to speak, or rather the beginning of all the horror they
had just blurredly experienced, something nasty must be about  to
happen.  He  was  distressed  to think that something nasty could
happen to somewhere as idyllic as this. He too glanced up.  There
was nothing in the sky.
 
"They're not about  to  attack  here,  are  they?"  he  said.  He
realized that this was merely a recording he was walking through,
but he still felt alarmed.
 
"Nothing is about to attack here," said Slartibartfast in a voice
which  unexpectedly  trembled with emotion. "This is where it all
started. This is the place itself. This is Krikkit."
 
He stared up into the sky.
 
The sky, from one horizon to another, from  east  to  west,  from
north to south, was utterly and completely black.

Chapter 11
 
Stomp stomp.
 
Whirrr.
 
"Pleased to be of service."
 
"Shut up."
 
"Thank you."
 
Stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp.
 
Whirrr.
 
"Thank you for making a simple door very happy."
 
"Hope your diodes rot."
 
"Thank you. Have a nice day."
 
Stomp stomp stomp stomp.
 
Whirrr.
 
"It is my pleasure to open for you ..."
 
"Zark off."
 
"... and my satisfaction to close again with the knowledge  of  a
job well done."
 
"I said zark off."
 
"Thank you for listening to this message."
 
Stomp stomp stomp stomp.
 
"Wop."
 
Zaphod stopped stomping. He had been stomping around the Heart of
Gold  for  days, and so far no door had said "wop" to him. He was
fairly certain that no door had said "wop" to him now. It was not
the  sort  of  thing  doors said. Too concise. Furthermore, there
were not enough doors. It sounded as if a hundred thousand people
had  said "wop", which puzzled him because he was the only person
on the ship.
 
It was dark. Most of the ship's non-essential systems were closed
down. It was drifting in a remote area of the Galaxy, deep in the
inky blackness of space. So  which  particular  hundred  thousand
people  would  turn up at this point and say a totally unexpected
"wop"?
 
He looked about him, up the corridor and down  the  corridor.  It
was  all  in  deep  shadow.  There were just the very dim pinkish
outlines of the  doors  which  glowed  in  the  dark  and  pulsed
whenever they spoke, though he had tried every way he could think
of of stopping them.
 
The lights were off so that his heads could avoid looking at each
other,  because  neither  of  them  was  currently a particularly
engaging sight, and nor had they been since he had made the error
of looking into his soul.
 
It had indeed been an error. It had been  late  one  night  -  of
course.
 
It had been a difficult day - of course.
 
There had been soulful music playing on the ship's sound system -
of course.
 
And he had, of course, been slightly drunk.
 
In other words, all the usual conditions which bring on a bout of
soul-searching  had  applied,  but  it had, nevertheless, clearly
been an error.
 
Standing now, silent and alone in the dark corridor he remembered
the  moment  and  shivered.  His  one head looked one way and his
other the other and each decided that the other was  the  way  to
go.
 
He listened but could hear nothing.
 
All there had been was the "wop".
 
It seemed an awfully long way to bring an awfully large number of
people just to say one word.
 
He started nervously to edge his way  in  the  direction  of  the
bridge.  There  at  least  he  would  feel in control. He stopped
again. The way he was feeling he didn't think he was  an  awfully
good person to be in control.
 
The  first  shock  of  that  moment,  thinking  back,  had   been
discovering that he actually had a soul.
 
In fact he'd always more or less assumed that he had  one  as  he
had  a  full  complement  of  everything  else, and indeed two of
somethings, but suddenly actually to encounter the thing  lurking
there deep within him had giving him a severe jolt.
 
And then to discover (this was the second shock) that  it  wasn't
the  totally wonderful object which he felt a man in his position
had a natural right to expect had jolted him again.
 
Then he had thought about what his position actually was and  the
renewed  shock had nearly made him spill his drink. He drained it
quickly before anything serious  happened  to  it.  He  then  had
another  quick one to follow the first one down and check that it
was all right.
 
"Freedom," he said aloud.
 
Trillian came on to the bridge at that  point  and  said  several
enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom.
 
"I can't cope with it," he said darkly, and sent  a  third  drink
down  to  see why the second hadn't yet reported on the condition
of the first. He looked uncertainly at both of her and  preferred
the one on the right.
 
He poured a drink down his other throat with  the  plan  that  it
would head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it,
and together they would get the second to pull  itself  together.
Then  all  three  would  go off in search of the first, give it a
good talking to and maybe a bit of a sing as well.
 
He felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink  had  understood
all  that, so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully
and a sixth for moral support.
 
"You're drinking too much," said Trillian.
 
His heads collided trying to sort out the four of  her  he  could
now  see  into  a  whole  position.  He gave up and looked at the
navigation screen and was astonished to see  a  quite  phenomenal
number of stars.
 
"Excitement and adventure and really wild things," he muttered.
 
"Look," she said in a sympathetic tone of  voice,  and  sat  down
near  him, "it's quite understandable that you're going to feel a
little aimless for a bit."
 
He boggled at her. He had never seen anyone sit on their own  lap
before.
 
"Wow," he said. He had another drink.
 
"You've finished the mission you've been on for years."
 
"I haven't been on it. I've tried to avoid being on it."
 
"You've still finished it."
 
He grunted. There seemed to be a terrific party going on  in  his
stomach.
 
"I think it finished me," he said. "Here I am, Zaphod Beeblebrox,
I  can  go anywhere, do anything. I have the greatest ship in the
know sky, a girl with whom things seem to be working  out  pretty
well ..."
 
"Are they?"
 
"As far as I can tell I'm not an expert in personal relationships
..."
 
Trillian raised her eyebrows.
 
"I am," he added, "one hell of a guy, I can do  anything  I  want
only I just don't have the faintest idea what."
 
He paused.
 
"One thing," he further added, "has suddenly ceased  to  lead  to
another"  -  in  contradiction  of which he had another drink and
slid gracelessly off his chair.
 
Whilst he slept it off, Trillian did a  little  research  in  the
ship's copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It had some
advice to offer on drunkenness.
 
"Go to it," it said, "and good luck."
 
It was cross-referenced to the entry concerning the size  of  the
Universe and ways of coping with that.
 
Then she found the entry on Han Wavel, an exotic holiday  planet,
and one of the wonders of the Galaxy.
 
Han Wavel is a world which consists largely  of  fabulous  ultra-
luxury  hotels  and casinos, all of which have been formed by the
natural erosion of wind and rain.
 
The chances of this happening are more or less  one  to  infinity
against.  Little  is known of how this came about because none of
the geophysicists, probability statisticians,  meteoranalysts  or
bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay
there.
 
Terrific, thought Trillian to herself, and within a few hours the
great white running-shoe ship was slowly powering down out of the
sky beneath a hot brilliant sun towards a brightly coloured sandy
spaceport.  The  ship  was  clearly  causing  a  sensation on the
ground, and Trillian  was  enjoying  herself.  She  heard  Zaphod
moving around and whistling somewhere in the ship.
 
"How are you?" she said over the general intercom.
 
"Fine," he said brightly, "terribly well."
 
"Where are you?"
 
"In the bathroom."
 
"What are you doing?"
 
"Staying here."
 
After an hour or two it became plain that he  meant  it  and  the
ship returned to the sky without having once opened its hatchway.
 
"Heigh ho," said Eddie the Computer.
 
Trillian nodded patiently, tapped her fingers a couple  of  times
and pushed the intercom switch.
 
"I think that enforced fun is probably not what you need at  this
point."
 
"Probably not," replied Zaphod from wherever he was.
 
"I think a bit of physical challenge would help draw you  out  of
yourself."
 
"Whatever you think, I think," said Zaphod.
 
"Recreational  Impossibilities"  was  a  heading   which   caught
Trillian's  eye  when,  a short while later, she sat down to flip
through the Guide again, and as  the  Heart  of  Gold  rushed  at
improbable speeds in an indeterminate direction, she sipped a cup
of something undrinkable from the Nutrimatic Drink Dispenser  and
read about how to fly.
 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has  this  to  say  on  the
subject of flying.
 
There is an art, it says, or rather a knack to flying.
 
The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself  at  the  ground
and miss.
 
Pick a nice day, it suggests, and try it.
 
The first part is easy.
 
All it requires is simply the ability to throw  yourself  forward
with  all  your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it's
going to hurt.
 
That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground.
 
Most people fail to miss the  ground,  and  if  they  are  really
trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it
fairly hard.
 
Clearly, it's the second point, the missing, which  presents  the
difficulties.
 
One problem is that you have to  miss  the  ground  accidentally.
It's  no  good  deliberately intending to miss the ground because
you won't. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by
something  else  when  you're  halfway  there, so that you are no
longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about  how
much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it.
 
It is notoriously difficult to prise  your  attention  away  from
these  three  things  during  the  split  second you have at your
disposal.  Hence  most  people's  failure,  and  their   eventual
disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport.
 
If,  however,  you  are  lucky  enough  to  have  your  attention
momentarily  distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous
pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and/or
personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by
suddenly spotting an extremely rare species  of  beetle  crawling
along  a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the
ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches  above  it
in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner.
 
This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration.
 
Bob and float, float and bob.
 
Ignore all considerations of  your  own  weight  and  simply  let
yourself waft higher.
 
Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this  point  because
they are unlikely to say anything helpful.
 
They are most likely to say something along the lines  of,  "Good
God, you can't possibly be flying!"
 
It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly
be right.
 
Waft higher and higher.
 
Try a few swoops, gentle ones at  first,  then  drift  above  the
treetops breathing regularly.
 
Do not wave at anybody.
 
When you have done this a few times you will find the  moment  of
distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve.
 
You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your
flight,  your  speed, your manoeuvrability, and the trick usually
lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do,  but
just allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway.
 
You will also learn how to land properly, which is something  you
will  almost  certainly cock up, and cock up badly, on your first
attempt.
 
There are private flying  clubs  you  can  join  which  help  you
achieve the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people
with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes
and  exhibit  and/or  explain  them  at  the crucial moments. Few
genuine hitch-hikers will be able to afford to join these  clubs,
but some may be able to get temporary employment at them.
 
Trillian read this longingly, but reluctantly decided that Zaphod
wasn't  really  in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly,
or for walking  through  mountains  or  for  trying  to  get  the
Brantisvogan  Civil  Service  to  acknowledge a change-of-address
card, which were  the  other  things  listed  under  the  heading
"Recreational Impossibilities".
 
Instead, she flew the ship to Allosimanius  Syneca,  a  world  of
ice,  snow, mind-hurtling beauty and stunning cold. The trek from
the snow plains of  Liska  to  the  summit  of  the  Ice  Crystal
Pyramids  of  Sastantua is long and gruelling, even with jet skis
and a team of Syneca Snowhounds, but the view  from  the  top,  a
view which takes in the Stin Glacier Fields, the shimmering Prism
Mountains and the far ethereal dancing icelights,  is  one  which
first  freezes  the  mind and then slowly releases it to hitherto
unexperienced horizons of beauty, and  Trillian,  for  one,  felt
that  she  could do with a bit of having her mind slowly released
to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty.
 
They went into a low orbit.
 
There lay the silverwhite beauty of Allosimanius  Syneca  beneath
them.
 
Zaphod stayed in bed with one head stuck under a pillow  and  the
other doing crosswords till late into the night.
 
Trillian nodded patiently again, counted to a  sufficiently  high
number, and told herself that the important thing now was just to
get Zaphod talking.
 
She prepared, by dint  of  deactivating  all  the  robot  kitchen
synthomatics,  the  most  fabulously  delicious  meal  she  could
contrive -  delicately  oiled  meals,  scented  fruits,  fragrant
cheeses, fine Aldebaran wines.
 
She carried it through to him and asked if he felt  like  talking
things through.
 
"Zark off," said Zaphod.
 
Trillian nodded patiently to herself, counted to an  even  higher
number,  tossed  the  tray lightly aside, walked to the transport
room and just teleported herself the hell out of his life.
 
She  didn't  even  programme  any  coordinates,  she  hadn't  the
faintest  idea  where she was going, she just went - a random row
of dots flowing through the Universe.
 
"Anything," she said to herself as  she  left,  "is  better  than
this."
 
"Good job too," muttered  Zaphod  to  himself,  turned  over  and
failed to go to sleep.
 
The next day he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship,
pretending  not to look for her, though he knew she wasn't there.
He ignored the computer's querulous demands to know just what the
hell  was  going on around here by fitting a small electronic gag
across a pair of its terminals.
 
After a while he began to turn down the lights. There was nothing
to see. Nothing was about to happen.
 
Lying in bed one night - and night was now  virtually  continuous
on  the ship - he decided to pull himself together, to get things
into some kind of perspective. He sat up sharply and  started  to
pull  clothes  on.  He  decided that there must be someone in the
Universe feeling  more  wretched,  miserable  and  forsaken  than
himself, and he determined to set out and find him.
 
Halfway to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be Marvin,
and he returned to bed.
 
It was a few hours later than this, as he stomped  disconsolately
about  the darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors, that he
heard the "wop" said, and it made him very nervous.
 
He leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man
trying  to  unbend  a  corkscrew  by  telekinesis.  He  laid  his
fingertips against the wall and felt an  unusual  vibration.  And
now  he  could  quite  clearly hear slight noises, and could hear
where they were coming from - they were coming from the bridge.
 
"Computer?" he hissed.
 
"Mmmm?" said the computer terminal nearest him, equally quietly.
 
"Is there someone on this ship?"
 
"Mmmmm," said the computer.
 
"Who is it?"
 
Mmmmm mmm mmmmm," said the computer.
 
"What?"
 
"Mmmmm mmmm mm mmmmmmmm."
 
Zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands.
 
"Oh, Zarquon," he muttered to himself.  Then  he  stared  up  the
corridor  towards  the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance
from which more and purposeful noises were coming, and  in  which
the gagged terminals were situated.
 
"Computer," he hissed again.
 
"Mmmmm?"
 
"When I ungag you ..."
 
"Mmmmm."
 
"Remind me to punch myself in the mouth."
 
"Mmmmm mmm?"
 
"Either one. Now just tell me this. One for yes, two for  no.  Is
it dangerous?"
 
"Mmmmm."
 
"It is?"
 
"Mmmm."
 
"You didn't just go `mmmm' twice?"
 
"Mmmm mmmm."
 
"Hmmmm."
 
He inched his way up the  corridor  as  if  he  would  rather  be
yarding his way down it, which was true.
 
He was within two yards  of  the  door  to  the  bridge  when  he
suddenly  realized  to his horror that it was going to be nice to
him, and he stopped dead. He hadn't been able  to  turn  off  the
doors' courtesy voice circuits.
 
This doorway to the bridge was  concealed  from  view  within  it
because of the excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been
designed to  curve  round,  and  he  had  been  hoping  to  enter
unobserved.
 
He leant despondently back against the wall again and  said  some
words which his other head was quite shocked to hear.
 
He peered at the dim pink outline of  the  door,  and  discovered
that in the darkness of the corridor he could just about make out
the Sensor Field which extended out into the  corridor  and  told
the  door  when there was someone there for whom it must open and
to whom it must make a cheery and pleasant remark.
 
He pressed himself hard back against the wall and  edged  himself
towards  the  door,  flattening  his chest as much as he possibly
could to avoid brushing against the very, very dim  perimeter  of
the  field.  He  held  his  breath,  and congratulated himself on
having lain in bed sulking for the  last  few  days  rather  than
trying  to work out his feelings on chest expanders in the ship's
gym.
 
He then realized he was going to have to speak at this point.
 
He took a series of  very  shallow  breaths,  and  then  said  as
quickly  and  as  quietly as he could, "Door, if you can hear me,
say so very, very quietly."
 
Very, very quietly, the door murmured, "I can hear you."
 
"Good. Now, in a moment, I'm going to ask you to open.  When  you
open I do not want you to say that you enjoyed it, OK?"
 
"OK."
 
"And I don't want you to say to me that I have made a simple door
very  happy,  or that it is your pleasure to open for me and your
satisfaction to close again with the  knowledge  of  a  job  well
done, OK?"
 
"OK."
 
"And I do not want you to ask me to have a nice day, understand?"
 
"I understand."
 
"OK," said Zaphod, tensing himself, "open now."
 
The door slid open quietly. Zaphod slipped quietly  through.  The
door closed quietly behind him.
 
"Is that the way you like it, Mr Beeblebrox?" said the  door  out
loud.
 
"I want you to imagine," said Zaphod to the group of white robots
who  swung  round  to stare at him at that point, "that I have an
extremely powerful Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in my hand."
 
There was an  immensely  cold  and  savage  silence.  The  robots
regarded  him  with  hideously  dead eyes. They stood very still.
There was something intensely  macabre  about  their  appearance,
especially  to Zaphod who had never seen one before or even known
anything about them. The Krikkit Wars  belonged  to  the  ancient
past  of  the  Galaxy,  and  Zaphod  had  spent most of his early
history lessons plotting how he was going to have  sex  with  the
girl  in  the  cybercubicle  next  to him, and since his teaching
computer had been an integral part of this plot it had eventually
had  all its history circuits wiped and replaced with an entirely
different set of ideas  which  had  then  resulted  in  it  being
scrapped  and sent to a home for Degenerate Cybermats, whither it
was followed by the girl who had inadvertently fallen  deeply  in
love  with  the  unfortunate  machine,  with  the result (a) that
Zaphod never got near her and (b) that he missed out on a  period
of  ancient  history that would have been of inestimable value to
him at this moment.
 
He stared at them in shock.
 
It was impossible to explain why,  but  their  smooth  and  sleek
white bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean, clinical
evil. From their hideously dead eyes to their  powerful  lifeless
feet,  they  were  clearly  the calculated product of a mind that
wanted simply to kill. Zaphod gulped in cold fear.
 
They had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall,  and  had
forced  a  passage through some of the vital innards of the ship.
Through the tangled wreckage Zaphod could see, with a further and
worse  sense of shock, that they were tunnelling towards the very
heart of the ship, the heart of the Improbability Drive that  had
been  so  mysteriously created out of thin air, the Heart of Gold
itself.
 
The robot closest to him was regarding him in such a  way  as  to
suggest  that  it  was  measuring  every smallest particle of his
body, mind and capability. And when it spoke, what it said seemed
to  bear this impression out. Before going on to what it actually
said, it is worth recording at this point  that  Zaphod  was  the
first  living  organic being to hear one of these creatures speak
for something over  ten  billion  years.  If  he  had  paid  more
attention  to his ancient history lessons and less to his organic
being, he might have been more impressed by this honour.
 
The robot's voice was like its body, cold, sleek and lifeless. It
had  almost  a  cultured  rasp to it. It sounded as ancient as it
was.
 
It said, "You do have a Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in your hand."
 
Zaphod didn't know what it  meant  for  a  moment,  but  then  he
glanced down at his own hand and was relieved to see that what he
had found clipped to a  wall  bracket  was  indeed  what  he  had
thought it was.
 
"Yeah," he said in a kind  of  relieved  sneer,  which  is  quite
tricky,  "well,  I  wouldn't  want  to  overtax your imagination,
robot." For a while nobody said  anything,  and  Zaphod  realized
that the robots were obviously not here to make conversation, and
that it was up to him.
 
"I can't help noticing that you have parked your ship,"  he  said
with  a  nod  of  one  of his heads in the appropriate direction,
"through mine."
 
There was no denying this. Without regard for any kind of  proper
dimensional  behaviour  they  had  simply materialized their ship
precisely where they wanted it to be, which  meant  that  it  was
simply  locked  through the Heart of Gold as if they were nothing
more than two combs.
 
Again, they made no response to this, and Zaphod wondered if  the
conversation  would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of
it in the form of questions.
 
"... haven't you?" he added.
 
"Yes," replied the robot."
 
"Er, OK," said Zaphod. "So what are you cats doing here?"
 
Silence.
 
"Robots," said Zaphod, "what are you robots doing here?"
 
"We have come," rasped the robot, "for the Gold of the Bail."
 
Zaphod nodded. He waggled his gun to invite further  elaboration.
The robot seemed to understand this.
 
"The Gold Bail is part of the Key we seek," continued the  robot,
"to release our Masters from Krikkit."
 
Zaphod nodded again. He waggled his gun again.
 
"The Key," continued the robot simply, "was disintegrated in time
and space. The Golden Bail is embedded in the device which drives
your ship. It will be reconstituted in the Key. Our Masters shall
be released. The Universal Readjustment will continue."
 
Zaphod nodded again.
 
"What are you talking about?" he said.
 
A slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robot's  totally
expressionless  face.  He  seemed  to be finding the conversation
depressing.
 
"Obliteration," it said. "We seek  the  Key,"  it  repeated,  "we
already  have the Wooden Pillar, the Steel Pillar and the Perspex
Pillar. In a moment we will have the Gold Bail ..."
 
"No you won't."
 
"We will," stated the robot.
 
"No you won't. It makes my ship work."
 
"In a moment," repeated the robot patiently, "we  will  have  the
Gold Bail ..."
 
"You will not," said Zaphod.
 
"And then we must go," said the robot, in all seriousness, "to  a
party."
 
"Oh," said Zaphod, startled. "Can I come?"
 
"No," said the robot. "We are going to shoot you."
 
"Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, waggling his gun.
 
"Yes," said the robot, and they shot him.
 
Zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him  again  before
he fell down.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 12
 
"Shhh," said Slartibartfast. "Listen and watch."
 
Night had now fallen on ancient Krikkit. The  sky  was  dark  and
empty. The only light was coming from the nearby town, from which
pleasant convivial sounds were drifting quietly  on  the  breeze.
They  stood  beneath  a  tree  from which heady fragrances wafted
around them. Arthur squatted and felt the Informational  Illusion
of  the  soil  and  the grass. He ran it through his fingers. The
soil seemed heavy and rich, the grass  strong.  It  was  hard  to
avoid  the impression that this was a thoroughly delightful place
in all respects.
 
The sky was, however, extremely blank and  seemed  to  Arthur  to
cast  a  certain  chill  over the otherwise idyllic, if currently
invisible, landscape. Still, he supposed, it's a question of what
you're used to.
 
He felt  a tap on his shoulder and looked up. Slartibartfast  was
quietly  directing his attention to something down the other side
of the hill. He looked and  could  just  see  some  faint  lights
dancing and waving, and moving slowly in their direction.
 
As they came nearer, sounds became audible too, and soon the  dim
lights  and  noises  resolved  themselves  into  a small group of
people who were walking home across the hill towards the town.
 
They walked quite near the watchers beneath  the  tree,  swinging
lanterns  which  made soft and crazy lights dance among the trees
and grass, chattering contentedly, and actually  singing  a  song
about  how terribly nice everything was, how happy they were, how
much they enjoyed working on the farm, and how pleasant it was to
be  going  home  to  see their wives and children, with a lilting
chorus to the effect that the flowers were smelling  particularly
nice at this time of year and that it was a pity the dog had died
seeing as it liked them so much. Arthur could almost imagine Paul
McCartney  sitting  with  his  feet  up  by  the fire on evening,
humming it to Linda and wondering what to buy with the  proceeds,
and thinking probably Essex.
 
"The Masters of Krikkit," breathed Slartibartfast  in  sepulchral
tones.
 
Coming, as it did, so hard upon the heels  of  his  own  thoughts
about  Essex this remark caused Arthur a moment's confusion. Then
the logic of the situation imposed itself on his scattered  mind,
and  he  discovered  that he still didn't understand what the old
man meant.
 
"What?" he said.
 
"The Masters of Krikkit," said Slartibartfast again, and  if  his
breathing  had  been sepulchral before, this time he sounded like
someone in Hades with bronchitis.
 
Arthur peered at the group and tried to make sense of what little
information he had at his disposal at this point.
 
The people in the group were clearly alien, if only because  they
seemed  a  little tall, thin, angular and almost as pale as to be
white, but otherwise they appeared remarkably pleasant; a  little
whimsical  perhaps, one wouldn't necessarily want to spend a long
coach journey with them, but the point was that if they  deviated
in any way from being good straightforward people it was in being
perhaps too nice rather than not nice enough.  So  why  all  this
rasping  lungwork  from  Slartibartfast  which  would  seem  more
appropriate to a radio commercial for one of  those  nasty  films
about chainsaw operators taking their work home with them?
 
Then, this Krikkit angle was a tough one, too.  He  hadn't  quite
fathomed the connection between what he knew as cricket, and what
...
 
Slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point  as
if sensing what was going through his mind.
 
"The game you know as cricket," he  said,  and  his  voice  still
seemed  to  be  wandering lost in subterranean passages, "is just
one of those curious freaks  of  racial  memory  which  can  keep
images  alive in the mind aeons after their true significance has
been lost in the mists of time. Of all the races on  the  Galaxy,
only  the  English  could  possibly revive the memory of the most
horrific wars ever to sunder the Universe and transform  it  into
what I'm afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull
and pointless game.
 
"Rather fond of it myself," he added, "but in most people's  eyes
you  have  been  inadvertently  guilty  of the most grotesque bad
taste. Particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the
wicket, that's very nasty."
 
"Um," said Arthur with a reflective frown to  indicate  that  his
cognitive  synapses  were coping with this as best as they could,
"um."
 
"And  these,"  said  Slartibartfast,  slipping  back  into  crypt
guttural  and  indicating  the  group  of Krikkit men who had now
walked past them, "are the ones who started it all, and  it  will
start tonight. Come, we will follow, and see why."
 
They slipped out from  underneath  the  tree,  and  followed  the
cheery party along the dark hill path. Their natural instinct was
to tread quietly and  stealthily  in  pursuit  of  their  quarry,
though,   as   they   were  simply  walking  through  a  recorded
Informational Illusion, they could as easily  have  been  wearing
euphoniums  and  woad  for all the notice their quarry would have
taken of them.
 
Arthur noticed that a couple of members of  the  party  were  now
singing  a  different  song. It came lilting back to them through
the soft night air, and was a sweet romantic ballad  which  would
have netted McCartney Kent and Sussex and enabled him to put in a
fair offer for Hampshire.
 
"You must surely know," said Slartibartfast to Ford, "what it  is
that is about to happen?"
 
"Me?" said Ford. "No."
 
"Did you not learn Ancient  Galactic  History  when  you  were  a
child?"
 
"I was in the cybercubicle behind Zaphod,"  said  Ford,  "it  was
very  distracting.  Which  isn't  to say that I didn't learn some
pretty stunning things."
 
At this point Arthur noticed a curious feature to the  song  that
the party were singing. The middle eight bridge, which would have
had  McCartney  firmly  consolidated  in  Winchester  and  gazing
intently  over  the  Test  Valley to the rich pickings of the New
Forest beyond,  had  some  curious  lyrics.  The  songwriter  was
referring to meeting with a girl not "under the moon" or "beneath
the stars" but "above the grass", which struck  Arthur  a  little
prosaic.  Then  he  looked up again at the bewildering black sky,
and had the distinct feeling that there was  an  important  point
here,  if  only he could grasp what it was. It gave him a feeling
of being alone in the Universe, and he said so.
 
"No," said Slartibartfast, with a slight quickening of his  step,
"the  people  of Krikkit have never thought to themselves `We are
alone in the Universe.' They are surrounded by a huge Dust Cloud,
you  see,  their  single  sun with its single world, and they are
right out on the utmost eastern edge of the  Galaxy.  Because  of
the  Dust  Cloud there has never been anything to see in the sky.
At night it is totally blank, During the day there  is  the  sun,
but  you  can't  look  directly  at  that so they don't. They are
hardly aware of the sky. It's as if they had a blind  spot  which
extended 180 degrees from horizon to horizon.
 
"You see, the reason why they have never thought `We are alone in
the  Universe'  is  that  until tonight they don't know about the
Universe. Until tonight."
 
He moved on, leaving the words ringing in the air behind him.
 
"Imagine," he said, "never even thinking `We  are  alone'  simply
because  it  has  never occurred to you to think that there's any
other way to be."
 
He moved on again.
 
"I'm afraid this is going to be a little unnerving," he added.
 
As he spoke, they became aware of a very thin roaring scream high
up  in  the  sightless  sky  above  them. They glanced upwards in
alarm, but for a moment or two could see nothing.
 
Then Arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them
had heard the noise, but that none of them seemed to know what to
so  with  it.   They   were   glancing   around   themselves   in
consternation,  left,  right,  forwards,  backwards,  even at the
ground. It never occurred to them to look upwards.
 
The profoundness of the shock and  horror  they  emanated  a  few
moments  later  when  the  burning  wreckage  of a spaceship came
hurtling and screaming out of the sky and crashed  about  half  a
mile  from where they were standing was something that you had to
be there to experience.
 
Some speak of the Heart of Gold in  hushed  tones,  some  of  the
Starship Bistromath.
 
Many speak of the legendary  and  gigantic  Starship  Titanic,  a
majestic  and  luxurious  cruise-liner  launched  from  the great
shipbuilding asteroid complexes of Artifactovol some hundreds  of
years ago now, and with good reason.
 
It was  sensationally  beautiful,  staggeringly  huge,  and  more
pleasantly  equipped than any ship in what now remains of history
(see note below on the Campaign for Real Time)  but  it  had  the
misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of Improbability
Physics,  long  before  this  difficult  and  cussed  branch   of
knowledge was fully, or at all, understood.
 
The designers and engineers decided, in their innocence, to build
a  prototype  Improbability  Field  into  it,  which  was  meant,
supposedly, to ensure that  it  was  Infinitely  Improbable  that
anything would ever go wrong with any part of the ship.
 
They did not realize that because  of  the  quasi-reciprocal  and
circular  nature of all Improbability calculations, anything that
was Infinitely Improbable was  actually  very  likely  to  happen
almost immediately.
 
The Starship Titanic was a monstrously pretty  sight  as  it  lay
beached  like  a silver Arcturan Megavoidwhale amongst the laser-
lit tracery of its construction gantries, a  brilliant  cloud  of
pins   and   needles  of  light  against  the  deep  interstellar
blackness; but when launched, it did not even manage to  complete
its  very  first  radio  message  -  an SOS - before undergoing a
sudden and gratuitous total existence failure.
 
However, the same event which saw the disastrous failure  of  one
science  in its infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another.
It was conclusively proven that more  people  watched  the  tri-d
coverage  of  the  launch  than actually existed at the time, and
this has now been recognized as the greatest achievement ever  in
the science of audience research.
 
Another spectacular media event of that time  was  the  supernova
which  the  star Ysllodins underwent a few hours later. Ysllodins
is the star around which most of  the  Galaxy's  major  insurance
underwriters live, or rather lived.
 
But whilst these spaceships, and other great ones which  come  to
mind,  such  as  the Galactic Fleet Battleships - the GSS Daring,
the GSS Audacy and the GSS Suicidal Insanity - are all spoken  of
with  awe,  pride,  enthusiasm,  affection,  admiration,  regret,
jealousy, resentment, in fact most of the better known  emotions,
the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was
Krikkit One, the first spaceship ever  built  by  the  people  of
Krikkit. This is not because it was a wonderful ship. It wasn't.
 
It was a crazy piece of near junk. It looked as if  it  had  been
knocked up in somebody's backyard, and this was in fact precisely
where it had been knocked up. The  astonishing  thing  about  the
ship  was  not  that  it was one well (it wasn't) but that it was
done at all. The period of time which  had  elapsed  between  the
moment  that  the people of Krikkit had discovered that there was
such a thing as space and the launching of their first  spaceship
was almost exactly a year.
 
Ford Prefect was extremely grateful, as he strapped  himself  in,
that  this  was  just another Informational Illusion, and that he
was therefore completely safe. In real life it wasn't a  ship  he
would have set foot in for all the rice wine in China. "Extremely
rickety" was one phrase which sprang to mind, and "Please  may  I
get out?" was another.
 
"This is going to fly?" said Arthur, giving gaunt looks,  at  the
lashed-together  pipework  and wiring which festooned the cramped
interior of the ship.
 
Slartibartfast  assured  him  that  it  would,  that  they   were
perfectly  safe  and  that  it  was  all  going  to  be extremely
instructive and not a little harrowing.
 
Ford and Arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed.
 
"Why not," said Ford, "go mad?"
 
In front of  them  and,  of  course,  totally  unaware  of  their
presence  for  the  very  good  reason that they weren't actually
there, were the three pilots. They had also constructed the ship.
They  had  been  on  the  hill  path that night singing wholesome
heartwarming songs. Their brains had been very slightly turned by
the  nearby  crash  of  the alien spaceship. They had spent weeks
stripping every tiniest last secret out of the wreckage  of  that
burnt-up  spaceship,  all  the  while  singing lilting spaceship-
stripping ditties. They had then built their own  ship  and  this
was  it.  This  was their ship, and they were currently singing a
little  song  about  that  too,  expressing  the  twin  joys   of
achievement  and ownership. The chorus was a little poignant, and
told of their sorrow that their work  had  kept  them  such  long
hours  in  the  garage,  away from the company of their wives and
children, who had missed them terribly but had kept them cheerful
by  bringing  them  continual stories of how nicely the puppy was
growing up.
 
Pow, they took off.
 
They roared into the sky like a ship that knew precisely what  it
was doing.
 
"No way," said Ford a while later after they had  recovered  from
the  shock  of  acceleration,  and  were  climbing  up out of the
planet's atmosphere, "no way," he repeated, "does  anyone  design
and  build a ship like this in a year, no matter how motivated. I
don't believe it. Prove it to me and I still won't  believe  it."
He  shook  his  head thoughtfully and gazed out of a tiny port at
the nothingness outside it.
 
The trip passed uneventfully  for  a  while,  and  Slartibartfast
fastwound them through it.
 
Very quickly, therefore, they arrived at the inner  perimeter  of
the  hollow,  spherical Dust Cloud which surrounded their sun and
home planet, occupying, as it were, the next orbit out.
 
It was more as if there was a gradual change in the  texture  and
consistency of space. The darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple
past them. It was a very cold darkness, a very  blank  and  heavy
darkness, it was the darkness of the night sky of Krikkit.
 
The coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a  slow  grip
on  Arthur's  heart, and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of
the Krikkit pilots which hung in the  air  like  a  thick  static
charge.  They  were  now  on  the very boundary of the historical
knowledge of their race. This was the  very  limit  beyond  which
none  of  them  had ever speculated, or even known that there was
any speculation to be done.
 
The darkness of the cloud buffeted at the ship.  Inside  was  the
silence  of  history.  Their  historic mission was to find out if
there was anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky, from
which the wrecked spaceship could have come, another world maybe,
strange and incomprehensible  though  this  thought  was  to  the
enclosed minds of those who had lived beneath the sky of Krikkit.
 
History was gathering itself to deliver another blow.
 
Still  the  darkness  thrummed  at  them,  the  blank   enclosing
darkness.  It  seemed  closer  and  closer,  thicker and thicker,
heavier and heavier. And suddenly it was gone.
 
They flew out of the cloud.
 
They saw the staggering jewels of the  night  in  their  infinite
dust and their minds sang with fear.
 
For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep  of
the  Galaxy,  itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the
Universe. And then they turned round.
 
"It'll have to go," the men of Krikkit said as they  headed  back
for home.
 
On the way back they sang a  number  of  tuneful  and  reflective
songs  on  the  subjects  of  peace,  justice, morality, culture,
sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms.

Chapter 13
 
 
 
"So  you  see,"  said   Slartibartfast,   slowly   stirring   his
artificially  constructed  coffee,  and thereby also stirring the
whirlpool interfaces between real and unreal numbers, between the
interactive perceptions of mind and Universe, and thus generating
the restructured matrices  of  implicitly  enfolded  subjectivity
which  allowed  his  ship to reshape the very concept of time and
space, "how it is."
 
"Yes," said Arthur.
 
"Yes," said Ford.
 
"What do I do," said Arthur, "with this piece of chicken?"
 
Slartibartfast glanced at him gravely.
 
"Toy with it," he said, "toy with it."
 
He demonstrated with his own piece.
 
Arthur did so, and felt  the  slight  tingle  of  a  mathematical
function  thrilling  through  the  chicken  leg as it moved four-
dimensionally through what Slartibartfast  had  assured  him  was
five-dimensional space.
 
"Overnight,"  said  Slartibartfast,  "the  whole  population   of
Krikkit   was   transformed   from  being  charming,  delightful,
intelligent ..."
 
"... if whimsical ..." interpolated Arthur.
 
"...  ordinary  people,"  said  Slartibartfast,  "into  charming,
delightful, intelligent ..."
 
"... whimsical ..."
 
"... manic xenophobes. The idea of a  Universe  didn't  fit  into
their  world picture, so to speak. They simply couldn't cope with
it. And so, charmingly, delightfully, intelligently,  whimsically
if you like, they decided to destroy it. What's the matter now?"
 
"I don't like the wine very much," said Arthur sniffing it.
 
"Well, send it back. It's all part of the mathematics of it."
 
Arthur did so. He didn't like  the  topography  of  the  waiter's
smile, but he'd never liked graphs anyway.
 
"Where are we going?" said Ford.
 
"Back   to   the   Room   of   Informational   Illusions,"   said
Slartibartfast,   rising   and   patting   his   mouth  with  the
mathematical representation of a paper napkin,  "for  the  second
half."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 14
 
"The people of Krikkit,"  said  His  High  Judgmental  Supremacy,
Judiciary  Pag,  LIVR  (the  Learned, Impartial and Very Relaxed)
Chairman of the Board of Judges at the Krikkit War Crimes  Trial,
"are,  well,  you  know, they're just a bunch of real sweet guys,
you know, who just happen to want to kill everybody. Hell, I feel
the same way some mornings. Shit.
 
"OK," he continued, swinging his feet up on to the bench in front
of  him  and pausing a moment to pick a thread off his Ceremonial
Beach Loafers, "so you  wouldn't  necessarily  want  to  share  a
Galaxy with these guys."
 
This was true.
 
The Krikkit attack on the Galaxy had been stunning. Thousands and
thousands  of  huge  Krikkit  warships  had leapt suddenly out of
hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of
major  worlds, first seizing vital material supplies for building
the next wave, and  then  calmly  zapping  those  worlds  out  of
existence.
 
The Galaxy, which had been enjoying a period of unusual peace and
prosperity  at  the  time,  reeled like a man getting mugged in a
meadow.
 
"I mean," continued Judiciary Pag, gazing round the  ultra-modern
(this  was  ten billion years ago, when "ultra-modern" meant lots
of stainless steel and  brushed  concrete)  and  huge  courtroom,
"these guys are just obsessed."
 
This too was true, and is the only  explanation  anyone  has  yet
managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the
people of Krikkit had pursued their new and  absolute  purpose  -
the destruction of everything that wasn't Krikkit.
 
It is also the only  explanation  for  their  bewildering  sudden
grasp  of  all  the  hypertechnology  involved  in building their
thousands of spaceships,  and  their  millions  of  lethal  white
robots.
 
These had really struck terror into the hearts  of  everyone  who
had  encountered  them  -  in most cases, however, the terror was
extremely short-lived, as was the person experiencing the terror.
They  were  savage,  single-minded  flying  battle machines. They
wielded formidable multifunctional battleclubs which,  brandished
one  way, would knock down buildings and, brandished another way,
fired blistering Omni-Destructo Zap Rays and, brandished a  third
way,  launched  a hideous arsenal of grenades, ranging from minor
incendiary devices  to  Maxi-Slorta  Hypernuclear  Devices  which
could take out a major sun. Simply striking the grenades with the
battleclubs simultaneously primed them, and  launched  them  with
phenomenal  accuracy  over  distances  ranging from mere yards to
hundreds of thousands of miles.
 
"OK," said Judiciary Pag again, "so we won." He paused and chewed
a  little  gum. "We won," he repeated, "but that's no big deal. I
mean a medium-sized galaxy against one little world, and how long
did it take us? Clerk of the Court?"
 
"M'lud?" said the severe little man in black, rising.
 
"How long, kiddo?"
 
"It is a trifle difficult, m'lud, to be precise in  this  matter.
Time and distance ..."
 
"Relax, guy, be vague."
 
"I hardly like to be vague, m'lud, over such a ..."
 
"Bite the bullet and be it."
 
The Clerk of the Court blinked at him. It  was  clear  that  like
most  of the Galactic legal profession he found Judiciary Pag (or
Zipo Bibrok 5 / 108, as his private name was known, inexplicably,
to  be) a rather distressing figure. He was clearly a bounder and
a cad. He seemed to think that the fact that he was the possessor
of  the  finest  legal mind ever discovered gave him the right to
behave exactly as he liked, and unfortunately he appeared  to  be
right.
 
"Er, well, m'lud, very approximately, two  thousand  years,"  the
Clerk murmured unhappily.
 
"And how many guys zilched out?"
 
"Two grillion, m'lud." The Clerk sat down. A  hydrospectic  photo
of  him  at  this  point would have revealed that he was steaming
slightly.
 
Judiciary Pag gazed once more around the courtroom, wherein  were
assembled  hundreds  of  the very highest officials of the entire
Galactic administration, all  in  their  ceremonial  uniforms  or
bodies,  depending  on  metabolism  and  custom. Behind a wall of
Zap-Proof Crystal stood a representative group of the  people  of
Krikkit,  looking  with  calm,  polite loathing at all the aliens
gathered to pass judgment on them. This was  the  most  momentous
occasion in legal history, and Judiciary Pag knew it.
 
He took out his chewing gum and stuck it under his chair.
 
"That's a whole lotta stiffs," he said quietly.
 
The grim silence in the courtroom  seemed  in  accord  with  this
view.
 
"So, like I said, these are a bunch of really sweet guys, but you
wouldn't  want  to  share a Galaxy with them, not if they're just
gonna keep at it, not if they're  not  gonna  learn  to  relax  a
little.  I  mean it's just gonna be continual nervous time, isn't
it, right? Pow, pow, pow,  when  are  they  next  coming  at  us?
Peaceful  coexistence is just right out, right? Get me some water
somebody, thank you."
 
He sat back and sipped reflectively.
 
"OK," he said, "hear me, hear me. It's,  like,  these  guys,  you
know,  are  entitled  to  their  own  view  of  the Universe. And
according to their view,  which  the  Universe  forced  on  them,
right,  they  did  right. Sounds crazy, but I think you'll agree.
They believe in ..."
 
He consulted a piece of paper which he found in the  back  pocket
of his Judicial jeans.
 
"They believe  in  `peace,  justice,  morality,  culture,  sport,
family life, and the obliteration of all other life forms'."
 
He shrugged.
 
"I've heard a lot worse," he said.
 
He scratched his crotch reflectively.
 
"Freeeow," he said. He took another sip of water, then held it up
to the light and frowned at it. He twisted it round.
 
"Hey, is there something in this water?" he said.
 
"Er, no, m'lud," said the Court Usher who had brought it to  him,
rather nervously.
 
"Then take it away," snapped Judiciary Pag, "and put something in
it. I got an idea."
 
He pushed away the glass and leaned forward.
 
"Hear me, hear me," he said.
 
The solution was brilliant, and went like this:
 
The planet of Krikkit was to be enclosed  for  perpetuity  in  an
envelope  of  Slo-Time,  inside  which life would continue almost
infinitely  slowly.  All  light  would  be  deflected  round  the
envelope  so  that  it  would  remain invisible and impenetrable.
Escape from the envelope would be utterly  impossible  unless  it
were locked from the outside.
 
When the rest of the Universe came to its  final  end,  when  the
whole  of  creation  reached  its  dying  fall  (this was all, of
course, in the days before it was  known  that  the  end  of  the
Universe  would  be  a spectacular catering venture) and life and
matter ceased to exist, then the planet of Krikkit  and  its  sun
would  emerge  from its Slo-Time envelope and continue a solitary
existence, such as it craved, in the twilight  of  the  Universal
void.
 
The Lock would be on an asteroid which  would  slowly  orbit  the
envelope.
 
The key would be the symbol of the Galaxy - the Wikkit Gate.
 
By the time the applause in the court had  died  down,  Judiciary
Pag was already in the Sens-O-Shower with a rather nice member of
the jury that he'd slipped a note to half an hour earlier.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 15
 
Two months later, Zipo Bibrok 5 / 108 had cut the bottoms off his
Galactic  State  jeans, and was spending part of the enormous fee
his judgments commanded lying on a jewelled beach having  Essence
of  Qualactin rubbed into his back by the same rather nice member
of  the  jury.  She  was  a  Soolfinian  girl  from  beyond   the
Cloudworlds  of  Yaga.  She had skin like lemon silk and was very
interested in legal bodies.
 
"Did you hear the news?" she said.
 
"Weeeeelaaaaah!" said Zipo Bibrok 5 / 108, and you would have had
to have been there to know exactly why he said this. None of this
was on the tape of Informational Illusions, and is all  based  on
hearsay.
 
"No,"  he  added,  when  the  thing  that  had   made   him   say
"Weeeeelaaaaah"  had  stopped  happening. He moved his body round
slightly to catch the first rays of the  third  and  greatest  of
primeval  Vod's  three  suns  which  was  now  creeping  over the
ludicrously beautiful horizon, and the  sky  now  glittered  with
some of the greatest tanning power ever known.
 
A fragrant breeze wandered up from the quiet sea,  trailed  along
the  beach,  and drifted back to sea again, wondering where to go
next. On a mad impulse it went up to the beach again. It  drifted
back to sea.
 
"I hope it isn't good news," muttered Zipo Bibrok 5 / 108,  "'cos
I don't think I could bear it."
 
"Your Krikkit judgment was carried  out  today,"  said  the  girl
sumptuously.  There  was  no  need  to say such a straightforward
thing sumptuously, but she went ahead and did it  anyway  because
it  was  that  sort  of day. "I heard it on the radio," she said,
"when I went back to the ship for the oil."
 
"Uhuh," muttered Zipo and rested his head back  on  the  jewelled
sand.
 
"Something happened," she said.
 
"Mmmm?"
 
"Just after the Slo-Time envelope  was  locked,"  she  said,  and
paused  a  moment  from  rubbing  in the Essence of Qualactin, "a
Krikkit warship which had been missing presumed destroyed  turned
out  to be just missing after all. It appeared and tried to seize
the Key."
 
Zipo sat up sharply.
 
"Hey, what?" he said.
 
"it's all right," she said in a voice which would have calmed the
Big  Bang down. "Apparently there was a short battle. The Key and
the warship were disintegrated and blasted  into  the  space-time
continuum. Apparently they are lost for ever."
 
She smiled, and ran a little more Essence of Qualactin on to  her
fingertips. He relaxed and lay back down.
 
"Do what you did a moment or two ago," he murmured.
 
"That?" she said.
 
"No, no," he said, "that."
 
She tried again.
 
"That?" she asked.
 
"Weeeeelaaaaah!"
 
Again, you had to be there.
 
The fragrant breeze drifted up from the sea again.
 
A magician wandered along the beach, but no one needed him.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 16
 
"Nothing  is  lost  for  ever,"  said  Slartibartfast,  his  face
flickering  redly  in  the  light  of  the candle which the robot
waiter was trying to take away,  "except  for  the  Cathedral  of
Chalesm."
 
"The what?" said Arthur with a start.
 
"The Cathedral of  Chalesm,"  repeated  Slartibartfast.  "It  was
during  the course of my researches at the Campaign for Real Time
that I ..."
 
"The what?" said Arthur again.
 
The old man paused and gathered his thoughts, for what  he  hoped
would  be one last onslaught on his story. The robot waiter moved
through the space-time matrices  in  a  way  which  spectacularly
combined  the  surly  with  the obsequious, made a snatch for the
candle and got it. They had had the bill, had argued convincingly
about  who  had  had  the cannelloni and how many bottles of wine
they had had, and, as Arthur had been dimly  aware,  had  thereby
successfully manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into
a parking orbit round  a  strange  planet.  The  waiter  was  now
anxious to complete his part of the charade and clear the bistro.
 
"All will become clear," said Slartibartfast.
 
"When?"
 
"In a minute. Listen. The time streams  are  now  very  polluted.
There's a lot of muck floating about in them, flotsam and jetsam,
and more and more of  it  is  now  being  regurgitated  into  the
physical world. Eddies in the space-time continuum, you see."
 
"So I hear," said Arthur.
 
"Look, where are we going?" said Ford,  pushing  his  chair  back
from the table with impatience. "Because I'm eager to get there."
 
"We are going," said Slartibartfast in a  slow,  measured  voice,
"to  try  to prevent the war robots of Krikkit from regaining the
whole of the Key they need to unlock the planet of  Krikkit  from
the  Slo-Time  envelope  and  release  the rest of their army and
their mad Masters."
 
"It's just," said Ford, "that you mentioned a party."
 
"I did," said Slartibartfast, and hung his head.
 
He realized that it had been a mistake, because the  idea  seemed
to  exercise  a  strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of
Ford Prefect. The more that Slartibartfast  unravelled  the  dark
and tragic story of Krikkit and its people, the more Ford Prefect
wanted to drink a lot and dance with girls.
 
The old man felt that he should  not  have  mentioned  the  party
until  he  absolutely had to. But there it was, the fact was out,
and Ford Prefect had attached himself to it the way  an  Arcturan
Megaleach  attaches  itself  to its victim before biting his head
off and making off with his spaceship.
 
"When," said Ford eagerly, "do we get there?"
 
"When I've finished telling you why we have to go there."
 
"I know why I'm going," said Ford, and leaned back, sticking  his
hands  behind  his  head.  He  gave  one of his smiles which made
people twitch.
 
Slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement.
 
He  had  been  planning  to  learn  to  play   the   octraventral
heebiephone  -  a pleasantly futile task, he knew, because he had
the wrong number of mouths.
 
He had also been planning to write an eccentric and  relentlessly
inaccurate monograph on the subject of equatorial fjords in order
to set the record wrong about  one  or  two  matters  he  saw  as
important.
 
Instead, he had somehow got talked into doing some part-time work
for  the  Campaign  for  Real Time and had started to take it all
seriously for the first time in his life.  As  a  result  he  now
found  himself  spending  his fast-declining years combating evil
and trying to save the Galaxy.
 
He found it exhausting work and sighed heavily.
 
"Listen," he said, "at Camtim ..."
 
"What?" said Arthur.
 
"The Campaign for Real Time, which I will tell you about later. I
noticed that five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent
times plopped back into existence seemed  to  correspond  to  the
five  pieces of the missing Key. Only two I could trace exactly -
the Wooden Pillar, which appeared on your planet, and the  Silver
Bail.  It  seems to be at some sort of party. We must go there to
retrieve it before the Krikkit robots find it, or who knows  what
may hap?"
 
"No," said Ford firmly. "We must go to  the  party  in  order  to
drink a lot and dance with girls."
 
"But haven't you understood everything I ...?"
 
"Yes," said Ford, with a sudden and unexpected fierceness,  "I've
understood  it  all  perfectly well. That's why I want to have as
many drinks and dance with as many girls as possible while  there
are still any left. If everything you've shown us is true ..."
 
"True? Of course it's true."
 
"... then we don't stand a whelk's chance in a supernova."
 
"A what?" said Arthur sharply again. He had  been  following  the
conversation  doggedly up to this point, and was keen not to lose
the thread now.
 
"A whelk's chance in a supernova," repeated Ford  without  losing
momentum. "The ..."
 
"What's a whelk got to do with a supernova?" said Arthur.
 
"It doesn't," said Ford levelly, "stand a chance in one."
 
He paused to see if the matter was now cleared  up.  The  freshly
puzzled  looks  clambering  across Arthur's face told him that it
wasn't.
 
"A supernova," said Ford as quickly and as clearly as  he  could,
"is  a  star which explodes at almost half the speed of light and
burns with the brightness of a billion suns and then collapses as
a  super-heavy  neutron  star.  It's  a star which burns up other
stars, got it? Nothing stands a chance in a supernova."
 
"I see," said Arthur.
 
"The ..."
 
"So why a whelk particularly?"
 
"Why not a whelk? Doesn't matter."
 
Arthur accepted this, and Ford continued, picking  up  his  early
fierce momentum as best he could.
 
"The  point  is,"  he  said,  "that  people  like  you  and   me,
Slartibartfast, and Arthur - particularly and especially Arthur -
are just dilletantes, eccentrics, layabouts, fartarounds  if  you
like."
 
Slartibartfast  frowned,  partly  in  puzzlement  and  partly  in
umbrage. He started to speak.
 
"- ..." is as far as he got.
 
"We're not obsessed by anything, you see," insisted Ford.
 
"..."
 
"And that's the deciding factor. We can't win against  obsession.
They care, we don't. They win."
 
"I care about lots of things,"  said  Slartibartfast,  his  voice
trembling   partly   with   annoyance,   but   partly  also  with
uncertainty.
 
"Such as?"
 
"Well," said  the  old  man,  "life,  the  Universe.  Everything,
really. Fjords."
 
"Would you die for them?"
 
"Fjords?" blinked Slartibartfast in surprise. "No."
 
"Well then."
 
"Wouldn't see the point, to be honest."
 
"And I still  can't  see  the  connection,"  said  Arthur,  "with
whelks."
 
Ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control, and
refused to be sidetracked by anything at this point.
 
"The point is," he hissed, "that we are not obsessive people, and
we don't stand a chance against ..."
 
"Except for your sudden obsession with whelks,"  pursued  Arthur,
"which I still haven't understood."
 
"Will you please leave whelks out of it?"
 
"I will if you will," said Arthur. "You brought the subject up."
 
"It was an error," said Ford, "forget them. The point is this."
 
He leant forward and rested his  forehead  on  the  tips  of  his
fingers.
 
"What was I talking about?" he said wearily.
 
"Let's just go down to  the  party,"  said  Slartibartfast,  "for
whatever reason." He stood up, shaking his head.
 
"I think that's what I was trying to say," said Ford.
 
For some unexplained reason, the teleport cubicles  were  in  the
bathroom.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 17
 
Time travel is increasingly regarded  as  a  menace.  History  is
being polluted.
 
The Encyclopedia Galactica has much to  say  on  the  theory  and
practice  of  time  travel,  most of which is incomprehensible to
anyone who hasn't spent at least four lifetimes studying advanced
hypermathematics,  and  since it was impossible to do this before
time travel was invented, there is a certain amount of  confusion
as  to  how  the  idea  was  arrived  at  in the first place. One
rationalization of this problem states that time travel  was,  by
its  very  nature,  discovered  simultaneously  at all periods of
history, but this is clearly bunk.
 
The trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as
well.
 
Here is an example. It may not seem to be  an  important  one  to
some  people,  but  to  others  it  is  crucial.  It is certainly
significant in that it was the  single  event  which  caused  the
Campaign  for Real Time to be set up in the first place (or is it
last? It depends which way round you see  history  as  happening,
and this too is now an increasingly vexed question).
 
There is, or was, a poet. His name was Lallafa, and he wrote what
are  widely  regarded  throughout  the Galaxy as being the finest
poems in existence, the Songs of the Long Land.
 
They are/were unspeakably wonderful. That is to say, you couldn't
speak  very  much  of them at once without being so overcome with
emotion, truth and a sense of wholeness  and  oneness  of  things
that  you wouldn't pretty soon need a brisk walk round the block,
possibly pausing at a bar on the way back for a  quick  glass  of
perspective and soda. They were that good.
 
Lallafa had lived in the forests of the Long Lands  of  Effa.  He
lived there, and he wrote his poems there. He wrote them on pages
made of dried habra leaves, without the benefit of  education  or
correcting fluid. He wrote about the light in the forest and what
he thought about that. He wrote about the darkness in the forest,
and  what  he thought about that. He wrote about the girl who had
left him and precisely what he thought about that.
 
Long after his death his poems were found and wondered over. News
of   them  spread  like  morning  sunlight.  For  centuries  they
illuminated and watered the lives  of  many  people  whose  lives
might otherwise have been darker and drier.
 
Then, shortly after the invention  of  time  travel,  some  major
correcting  fluid  manufacturers wondered whether his poems might
have been better still if he had had access to some  high-quality
correcting  fluid, and whether he might be persuaded to say a few
words on that effect.
 
They travelled the time waves, they found him, they explained the
situation  -  with  some  difficulty  -  to  him,  and did indeed
persuade him. In fact they persuaded him to such an  effect  that
he  became extremely rich at their hands, and the girl about whom
he was otherwise destined to write which such precision never got
around  to  leaving him, and in fact they moved out of the forest
to a rather nice pad in town and he frequently  commuted  to  the
future to do chat shows, on which he sparkled wittily.
 
He never got around to writing the poems, of course, which was  a
problem,   but   an  easily  solved  one.  The  manufacturers  of
correcting fluid simply packed him off for a week somewhere  with
a  copy of a later edition of his book and a stack of dried habra
leaves to copy them out on to, making the odd deliberate  mistake
and correction on the way.
 
Many people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless. Others
argue  that  they  are  exactly  the same as they always were, so
what's changed? The first people say that that isn't  the  point.
They aren't quite sure what the point is, but they are quite sure
that that isn't it. They set up the Campaign for Real Time to try
to  stop this sort of thing going on. Their case was considerably
strengthened  by  the  fact  that  a  week  after  they  had  set
themselves  up,  news broke that not only had the great Cathedral
of Chalesm been pulled down in order to build a new ion refinery,
but  that the construction of the refinery had taken so long, and
had had to extend so far back into the past in order to allow ion
production  to  start  on time, that the Cathedral of Chalesm had
now never been built in the first place. Picture postcards of the
cathedral suddenly became immensely valuable.
 
So a lot of history is now gone for ever. The Campaign  for  Real
Timers  claim  that  just  as  easy travel eroded the differences
between one country  and  another,  and  between  one  world  and
another,  so  time  travel is now eroding the differences between
one age and another. "The past," they say, "is now truly  like  a
foreign country. They do things exactly the same there."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 18
 
Arthur materialized, and did so with all the customary staggering
about  and  clasping at his throat, heart and various limbs which
he still indulged himself  in  whenever  he  made  any  of  these
hateful  and  painful materializations that he was determined not
to let himself get used to.
 
He looked around for the others.
 
They weren't there.
 
He looked around for the others again.
 
They still weren't there.
 
He closed his eyes.
 
He opened them
 
He looked around for the others.
 
They obstinately persisted in their absence.
 
He closed his eyes again, preparatory to making  this  completely
futile  exercise  once more, and because it was only then, whilst
his eyes were closed, that his brain began to register  what  his
eyes  had  been looking at whilst they were open, a puzzled frown
crept across his face.
 
So he opened his eyes again to check  his  facts  and  the  frown
stayed put.
 
If anything, it intensified, and got a good firm  grip.  If  this
was  a  party  it  was  a  very  bad  one,  so bad, in fact, that
everybody else had left. He abandoned this  line  of  thought  as
futile.  Obviously  this  wasn't  a  party.  It  was a cave, or a
labyrinth, or a tunnel of  something  -  there  was  insufficient
light  to tell. All was darkness, a damp shiny darkness. The only
sounds were the  echoes  of  his  own  breathing,  which  sounded
worried.  He coughed very slightly, and then had to listen to the
thin ghostly echo of his  cough  trailing  away  amongst  winding
corridors and sightless chambers, as of some great labyrinth, and
eventually returning to him via the same unseen corridors, as  if
to say ... "Yes?"
 
This happened to every slightest noise he made, and  it  unnerved
him.  He  tried to hum a cheery tune, but by the time it returned
to him it was a hollow dirge and he stopped.
 
His mind  was  suddenly  full  of  images  from  the  story  that
Slartibartfast had been telling him. He half-expected suddenly to
see lethal white robots step silently from the shadows  and  kill
him.  He  caught  his breath. They didn't. He let it go again. He
didn't know what he did expect.
 
Someone or something, however, seemed to be expecting him, for at
that  moment  there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie
green neon sign.
 
It said, silently:
 
You have been Diverted
 
The sign flicked off again, in a way which Arthur was not at  all
certain  he  liked.  It  flicked  off with a sort of contemptuous
flourish. Arthur then tried to assure himself that this was  just
a  ridiculous  trick of his imagination. A neon sign is either on
or off, depending on whether it has electricity  running  through
it  or  not.  There  was  no  way, he told himself, that it could
possibly effect the transition from one state to the other with a
contemptuous  flourish. He hugged himself tightly in his dressing
gown and shivered, nevertheless.
 
The neon sign in the depths now suddenly lit up, bafflingly, with
just three dots and a comma. Like this:
 
 
Only in green neon.
 
It was trying, Arthur realized after staring at this  perplexedly
for  a  second  or  two, to indicate that there was more to come,
that the sentence was not complete. Trying with almost superhuman
pedantry, he reflected. Or at least, inhuman pedantry.
 
The sentence then completed itself with these two words:
 
Arthur Dent.
 
He reeled. He steadied himself to have another clear look at  it.
It still said Arthur Dent, so he reeled again.
 
Once again, the sign flicked off, and left him  blinking  in  the
darkness  with  just the dim red image of his name jumping on his
retina.
 
Welcome, the sign now suddenly said.
 
After a moment, it added:
 
I Don't Think.
 
The stone-cold fear which had been hovering about Arthur all this
time,  waiting for its moment, recognized that its moment had now
come and pounced on him. He tried to fight  it  off.  He  dropped
into  a kind of alert crouch that he had once seen somebody do on
television, but it must have been someone with stronger knees. He
peered huntedly into the darkness.
 
"Er, hello?" he said.
 
He cleared his throat and said it again, more loudly and  without
the  "er".  At some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly
as if somebody started to beat on a bass drum.
 
He listened to it for a few seconds and realized that it was just
his heart beating.
 
He listened for a few seconds more and realized  that  it  wasn't
his heart beating, it was somebody down the corridor beating on a
bass drum.
 
Beads of sweat formed on his brow, tensed themselves,  and  leapt
off.  He  put a hand out on the floor to steady his alert crouch,
which wasn't holding up very well. The sign changed itself again.
It said:
 
Do Not be Alarmed.
 
After a pause, it added:
 
Be Very Very Frightened, Arthur Dent.
 
Once again it flicked off. Once again it left  him  in  darkness.
His  eyes seemed to be popping out of his head. He wasn't certain
if this was because they were trying to see more clearly,  or  if
they simply wanted to leave at this point.
 
"Hello?" he said again, this time trying to put a note of  rugged
and aggressive self-assertion into it. "Is anyone there?"
 
There was no reply, nothing.
 
This unnerved Arthur Dent even more than a reply would have done,
and  he  began  to  back away from the scary nothingness. And the
more he backed away, the more scared he became. After a while  he
realized that the reason for this was because of all the films he
had seen in which the hero backs further and  further  away  from
some imagined terror in front of him, only to bump into it coming
up from behind.
 
Just then it suddenly  occurred  to  him  to  turn  round  rather
quickly.
 
There was nothing there.
 
Just blackness.
 
This really unnerved him, and he started to back away from  that,
back the way he had come.
 
After doing this for a short while it suddenly  occurred  to  him
that  he  was  now  backing  towards  whatever it was he had been
backing away from in the first place.
 
This, he couldn't help thinking, must be a foolish thing  to  do.
He  decided  he  would be better off backing the way he had first
been backing, and turned around again.
 
It turned out at this point that his second impulse had been  the
correct  one,  because there was an indescribably hideous monster
standing quietly behind him. Arthur  yawed  wildly  as  his  skin
tried  to  jump  one  way  and his skeleton the other, whilst his
brain tried to work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl
out of.
 
"Bet you weren't expecting to see me again,"  said  the  monster,
which  Arthur  couldn't help thinking was a strange remark for it
to make, seeing as he had never met the creature before. He could
tell  that he hadn't met the creature before from the simple fact
that he was able to sleep at nights. It was ... it was ... it was
...
 
Arthur blinked at it. It stood very still. It did look  a  little
familiar.
 
A terrible cold calm came over him as he realized  that  what  he
was looking at was a six-foot-high hologram of a housefly.
 
He wondered why anybody would  be  showing  him  a  six-foot-high
hologram  of  a housefly at this time. He wondered whose voice he
had heard.
 
It was a terribly realistic hologram.
 
It vanished.
 
"Or perhaps you remember me better," said the voice suddenly, and
it  was a deep, hollow malevolent voice which sounded like molten
tar glurping out of a  drum  with  evil  on  its  mind,  "as  the
rabbit."
 
With a sudden ping,  there  was  a  rabbit  there  in  the  black
labyrinth  with  him,  a  huge,  monstrously,  hideously soft and
lovable rabbit - an image again, but one on  which  every  single
soft and lovable hair seemed like a real and single thing growing
in its soft and lovable coat. Arthur was startled to see his  own
reflection  in its soft and lovable unblinking and extremely huge
brown eyes.
 
"Born in darkness," rumbled the voice, "raised in  darkness.  One
morning  I  poked  my head for the first time into the bright new
world and got it split open by what felt suspiciously  like  some
primitive instrument made of flint.
 
"Made by you, Arthur Dent, and wielded by you. Rather hard  as  I
recall.
 
"You turned my skin into a bag for keeping interesting stones in.
I  happen  to  know that because in my next life I came back as a
fly again and you swatted me. Again. Only this time  you  swatted
me with the bag you'd made of my previous skin.
 
"Arthur Dent, you are not merely a cruel and heartless  man,  you
are also staggeringly tactless."
 
The voice paused whilst Arthur gawped.
 
"I see you have lost the bag,"  said  the  voice.  "Probably  got
bored with it, did you?"
 
Arthur shook his head helplessly. He wanted to  explain  that  he
had  been  in  fact  very fond of the bag and had looked after it
very well and had taken it with him wherever he  went,  but  that
somehow  every  time he travelled anywhere he seemed inexplicably
to end up with the wrong bag and that, curiously enough, even  as
they stood there he was just noticing for the first time that the
bag he had with him at the moment appeared  to  be  made  out  of
rather nasty fake leopard skin, and wasn't the one he'd had a few
moments ago before he arrived in this whatever place it was,  and
wasn't  one  he  would  have  chosen himself and heaven knew what
would be in it as it wasn't his, and he would  much  rather  have
his  original  bag  back,  except  that he was of course terribly
sorry for having  so  peremptorily  removed  it,  or  rather  its
component  parts,  i.e. the rabbit skin, from its previous owner,
viz. the rabbit whom he currently had the  honour  of  attempting
vainly to address.
 
All he actually managed to say was "Erp".
 
"Meet the newt you trod on," said the voice.
 
And there was, standing in the  corridor  with  Arthur,  a  giant
green  scaly  newt.  Arthur  turned, yelped, leapt backwards, and
found himself standing in the middle of  the  rabbit.  He  yelped
again, but could find nowhere to leap to.
 
"That was me, too," continued the voice in a low menacing rumble,
"as if you didn't know ..."
 
"Know?" said Arthur with a start. "Know?"
 
"The interesting thing about reincarnation,"  rasped  the  voice,
"is  that  most  people,  most  spirits, are not aware that it is
happening to them."
 
He paused for effect. As far as Arthur was  concerned  there  was
already quite enough effect going on.
 
"I was aware," hissed  the  voice,  "that  is,  I  became  aware.
Slowly. Gradually."
 
He, whoever he was, paused again and gathered breath.
 
"I could hardly help it, could I?" he bellowed,  "when  the  same
thing  kept happening, over and over and over again! Every life I
ever lived, I got killed by Arthur Dent. Any world, any body, any
time,  I'm  just  getting settled down, along comes Arthur Dent -
pow, he kills me.
 
"Hard not to notice. Bit of a memory jogger. Bit  of  a  pointer.
Bit of a bloody giveaway!
 
"`That's funny,' my spirit would say to itself as it  winged  its
way  back  to  the netherworld after another fruitless Dent-ended
venture into the land of the living, `that man who just ran  over
me as I was hopping across the road to my favourite pond looked a
little familiar ...' And gradually I got to  piece  it  together,
Dent, you multiple-me-murderer!"
 
The echoes of his voice roared up and down the corridors.  Arthur
stood silent and cold, his head shaking with disbelief.
 
"Here's the moment, Dent," shrieked the  voice,  now  reaching  a
feverish  pitch  of  hatred,  "here's  the  moment when at last I
knew!"
 
It was indescribably hideous, the thing that suddenly  opened  up
in  front  of Arthur, making him gasp and gargle with horror, but
here's an attempt at a description of how hideous it was. It  was
a huge palpitating wet cave with a vast, slimy, rough, whale-like
creature rolling around  it  and  sliding  over  monstrous  white
tombstones.  High  above the cave rose a vast promontory in which
could be seen the dark recesses of  two  further  fearful  caves,
which ...
 
Arthur Dent suddenly realized that he  was  looking  at  his  own
mouth,  when  his  attention was meant to be directed at the live
oyster that was being tipped helplessly into it.
 
He staggered back with a cry and averted his eyes.
 
When he looked again  the  appalling  apparition  had  gone.  The
corridor  was  dark  and,  briefly, silent. He was alone with his
thoughts. They  were  extremely  unpleasant  thoughts  and  would
rather have had a chaperone.
 
The next noise, when it came, was the low heavy roll of  a  large
section  of wall trundling aside, revealing, for the moment, just
dark blackness behind it. Arthur looked into it in much the  same
way that a mouse looks into a dark dog-kennel.
 
And the voice spoke to him again.
 
"Tell me it was a coincidence, Dent," it said.  "I  dare  you  to
tell me it was a coincidence!"
 
"It was a coincidence," said Arthur quickly.
 
"It was not!" came the answering bellow.
 
"It was," said Arthur, "it was ..."
 
"If it was a coincidence, then my name," roared  the  voice,  "is
not Agrajag!!!"
 
"And presumably," said Arthur, "you would  claim  that  that  was
your name."
 
"Yes!" hissed Agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather  deft
syllogism.
 
"Well, I'm afraid it was still a coincidence," said Arthur.
 
"Come in here and say that!" howled the voice, in sudden apoplexy
again.
 
Arthur walked in and said that it was a coincidence, or at least,
he  nearly said that it was a coincidence. His tongue rather lost
its footing towards the end of the last word because  the  lights
came up and revealed what it was he had walked into.
 
It was a Cathedral of Hate.
 
It was the product of a mind that was  not  merely  twisted,  but
actually sprained.
 
It was huge. It was horrific.
 
It had a Statue in it.
 
We will come to the Statue in a moment.
 
The vast, incomprehensibly vast chamber looked as if it had  been
carved  out  of the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this
was that that was precisely what it had been carved  out  of.  It
seemed  to  Arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood
and gaped at it.
 
It was black.
 
Where it wasn't black you were inclined  to  wish  that  it  was,
because  the  colours  with which some of the unspeakable details
were picked out ranged horribly  across  the  whole  spectrum  of
eye-defying  colours  from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in
Liver Purple, Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow,  Burnt  hombre  and
Gan Green on the way.
 
The unspeakable details  which  these  colours  picked  out  were
gargoyles which would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch.
 
The gargoyles  all  looked  inwards  from  the  walls,  from  the
pillars,  from  the  flying  buttresses,  from  the choir stalls,
towards the Statue, to which we will come in a moment.
 
And if the gargoyles would have put Francis Bacon off his  lunch,
then it was clear from the gargoyles' faces that the Statue would
have put them off theirs, had they been alive to  eat  it,  which
they  weren't,  and  had  anybody tried to serve them some, which
they wouldn't.
 
Around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone  tablets  in
memory of those who had fallen to Arthur Dent.
 
The names of some of those commemorated were underlined  and  had
asterisks against them. So, for instance, the name of a cow which
had been slaughtered and of which Arthur Dent had happened to eat
a  fillet  steak  would  have the plainest engraving, whereas the
name of a fish which Arthur had himself caught and  then  decided
he  didn't  like  and  left on the side of the plate had a double
underlining, three sets of asterisks and a bleeding dagger  added
as decoration, just to make the point.
 
And what was most disturbing  about  all  this,  apart  from  the
Statue,  to  which we are, by degrees, coming, was the very clear
implication that all these people and creatures were  indeed  the
same person, over and over again.
 
And it was equally clear that this person was, however  unfairly,
extremely upset and annoyed.
 
In fact it would be fair to say that he had reached  a  level  of
annoyance  the like of which had never been seen in the Universe.
It was an annoyance of epic proportions, a burning searing  flame
of  annoyance,  an  annoyance which now spanned the whole of time
and space in its infinite umbrage.
 
And this annoyance had been given its fullest expression  in  the
Statue  in the centre of all this monstrosity, which was a statue
of Arthur Dent, and an unflattering one. Fifty feet  tall  if  it
was  an  inch,  there  was not an inch of it which wasn't crammed
with insult to its subject matter, and fifty feet of that sort of
thing  would  be  enough  to  make any subject feel bad. From the
small pimple on the side of his nose to the poorish  cut  of  his
dressing  gown,  there  was no aspect of Arthur Dent which wasn't
lambasted and vilified by the sculptor.
 
Arthur appeared as  a  gorgon,  an  evil,  rapacious,  ravenning,
bloodied  ogre,  slaughtering his way through an innocent one-man
Universe.
 
With each of the thirty arms which  the  sculptor  in  a  fit  of
artistic  fervour had decided to give him, he was either braining
a rabbit, swatting a fly, pulling a wishbone, picking a flea  out
of  his  hair,  or  doing something which Arthur at first looking
couldn't quite identify.
 
His many feet were mostly stamping on ants.
 
Arthur put his hands over his eyes, hung his head  and  shook  it
slowly  from  side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness
of things.
 
And when he opened his eyes again, there in front  of  him  stood
the  figure  of  the man or creature, or whatever it was, that he
had supposedly been persecuting all this time.
 
"HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!" said Agrajag.
 
He, or it, or whatever, looked like a mad  fat  bat.  He  waddled
slowly around Arthur, and poked at him with bent claws.
 
"Look ...!" protested Arthur.
 
"HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!!!"  explained  Agrajag,   and   Arthur
reluctantly  accepted  this  on  the  grounds  that he was rather
frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition.
 
Agrajag was black, bloated, wrinkled and leathery.
 
His batwings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic
broken floundering things they were that if they had been strong,
muscular beaters of the air. The frightening thing  was  probably
the  tenacity of his continued existence against all the physical
odds.
 
He had the most astounding collection of teeth.
 
They looked as if they each  came  from  a  completely  different
animal,  and  they  were  ranged around his mouth at such bizarre
angles it seemed that if he ever actually tried to chew  anything
he'd  lacerate  half his own face along with it, and possibly put
an eye out as well.
 
Each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about  as
sane as a fish in a privet bush.
 
"I was at a cricket match," he rasped.
 
This seemed on the face of it such  a  preposterous  notion  that
Arthur practically choked.
 
"Not in this body," screeched the creature, "not  in  this  body!
This  is  my last body. My last life. This is my revenge body. My
kill-Arthur-Dent body. My last chance. I had to fight to get  it,
too."
 
"But ..."
 
"I was at," roared Agrajag, "a cricket match! I had a weak  heart
condition,  but  what,  I  said to my wife, can happen to me at a
cricket match? As I'm watching, what happens?
 
"Two people quite maliciously appear out  of  thin  air  just  in
front  of  me.  The  last thing I can't help but notice before my
poor heart gives out in shock is that one of them is Arthur  Dent
wearing a rabbit bone in his beard. Coincidence?"
 
"Yes," said Arthur.
 
"Coincidence?" screamed the  creature,  painfully  thrashing  its
broken  wings, and opening a short gash on its right cheek with a
particularly nasty tooth. On closer  examination,  such  as  he'd
been  hoping to avoid, Arthur noticed that much of Agrajag's face
was covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters.
 
He backed away nervously. He tugged at his beard. He was appalled
to  discover  that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it. He
pulled it out and threw it away.
 
"Look," he said, "it's just fate playing silly buggers with  you.
With me. With us. It's a complete coincidence."
 
"What have you got  against  me,  Dent?"  snarled  the  creature,
advancing on him in a painful waddle.
 
"Nothing," insisted Arthur, "honestly, nothing."
 
Agrajag fixed him with a beady stare.
 
"Seems a strange way to relate to  somebody  you've  got  nothing
against,  killing them all the time. Very curious piece of social
interaction, I would call that. I'd also call it a lie!"
 
"But look," said Arthur, "I'm very sorry. There's been a terrible
misunderstanding. I've got to go. Have you got a clock? I'm meant
to be helping save the Universe." He backed away still further.
 
Agrajag advanced still further.
 
"At one point," he hissed, "at one point, I decided to  give  up.
Yes,  I would not come back. I would stay in the netherworld. And
what happened?"
 
Arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that  he  had  no
idea  and  didn't want to have one either. He found he had backed
up against the cold dark stone that had been carved by  who  knew
what  Herculean  effort  into a monstrous travesty of his bedroom
slippers. He glanced up at his own  horrendously  parodied  image
towering  above  him.  He was still puzzled as to what one of his
hands was meant to be doing.
 
"I got  yanked  involuntarily  back  into  the  physical  world,"
pursued  Agrajag,  "as  a  bunch  of petunias. In, I might add, a
bowl. This particularly happy little lifetime  started  off  with
me,  in  my  bowl,  unsupported,  three  hundred  miles above the
surface of a particularly grim planet. Not  a  naturally  tenable
position  for  a  bowl of petunias, you might think. And you'd be
right. That life ended a very short while  later,  three  hundred
miles  lower.  In, I might add, the fresh wreckage of a whale. My
spirit brother."
 
He leered at Arthur with renewed hatred.
 
"On the way down,"  he  snarled,  "I  couldn't  help  noticing  a
flashy-looking white spaceship. And looking out of a port on this
flashy-looking  spaceship  was  a   smug-looking   Arthur   Dent.
Coincidence?!!"
 
"Yes!" yelped Arthur. He glanced up again, and realized that  the
arm that had puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into
existence a bowl of doomed petunias. This was not a concept which
leapt easily to the eye.
 
"I must go," insisted Arthur.
 
"You may go," said Agrajag, "after I have killed you."
 
"No, that won't be any use," explained Arthur, beginning to climb
up  the hard stone incline of his carved slipper, "because I have
to save the Universe, you see. I have  to  find  a  Silver  Bail,
that's the point. Tricky thing to do dead."
 
"Save the Universe!" spat Agrajag with contempt. "You should have
thought of that before you started your vendetta against me! What
about the time you were on Stavromula Beta and someone ..."
 
"I've never been there," said Arthur.
 
"... tried to assassinate you and you ducked. Who  do  you  think
the bullet hit? What did you say?"
 
"Never been there," repeated Arthur. "What are you talking about?
I have to go."
 
Agrajag stopped in his tracks.
 
"You must have been there. You  were  responsible  for  my  death
there, as everywhere else. An innocent bystander!" He quivered.
 
"I've never heard of the place," insisted Arthur. "I've certainly
never had anyone try to assassinate me. Other than you. Perhaps I
go there later, do you think?"
 
Agrajag blinked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror.
 
"You haven't been to Stavromula Beta ... yet?" he whispered.
 
"No," said Arthur,  "I  don't  know  anything  about  the  place.
Certainly never been to it, and don't have any plans to go."
 
"Oh, you go there all right," muttered Agrajag in a broken voice,
"you go there all right. Oh zark!" he tottered, and stared wildly
about him at his huge Cathedral of Hate. "I've brought  you  here
too soon!"
 
He started to scream and  bellow.  "I've  brought  you  here  too
zarking soon!"
 
Suddenly he rallied, and turned a baleful, hating eye on Arthur.
 
"I'm going to kill you  anyway!"  he  roared.  "Even  if  it's  a
logical impossibility I'm going to zarking well try! I'm going to
blow this whole mountain up!" He screamed, "Let's see you get out
of this one, Dent!"
 
He rushed in a painful waddling hobble to what appeared to  be  a
small black sacrificial altar. He was shouting so wildly now that
he was really carving his face up badly. Arthur leaped down  from
his  vantage  place on the carving of his own foot and ran to try
to restrain the three-quarters-crazed creature.
 
He leaped upon him, and brought the strange monstrosity  crashing
down on top of the altar.
 
Agrajag screamed again, thrashed wildly for a brief  moment,  and
turned a wild eye on Arthur.
 
"You know what you've done?" he gurgled painfully.  "You've  only
gone  and  killed  me  again.  i  mean, what do you want from me,
blood?"
 
He thrashed again  in  a  brief  apoplectic  fit,  quivered,  and
collapsed, smacking a large red button on the altar as he did so.
 
Arthur started with horror and fear, first at what he appeared to
have  done,  and  then at the loud sirens and bells that suddenly
shattered the air  to  announce  some  clamouring  emergency.  He
stared wildly around him.
 
The only exit appeared to be  the  way  he  came  in.  He  pelted
towards  it,  throwing away the nasty fake leopard-skin bag as he
did so.
 
He dashed randomly, haphazardly through the labyrinthine maze, he
seemed  to  be pursued more and more fiercely by claxons, sirens,
flashing lights.
 
Suddenly, he turned a corner and there was a light  in  front  of
him.
 
It wasn't flashing. It was daylight.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 19
 
Although it has been said that on Earth alone in  our  Galaxy  is
Krikkit  (or cricket) treated as fit subject for a game, and that
for this reason the Earth has been shunned, this does only  apply
to our Galaxy, and more specifically to our dimension. In some of
the higher dimensions they feel they  can  more  or  less  please
themselves, and have been playing a peculiar game called Brockian
Ultra-Cricket for whatever their transdimensional  equivalent  of
billions of years is.
 
 "Let's be blunt, it's a nasty  game"  (says  The  Hitch  Hiker's
Guide  to the Galaxy) "but then anyone who has been to any of the
higher dimensions will know that they're a pretty  nasty  heathen
lot  up  there  who should just be smashed and done in, and would
be, too, if anyone could work out a way  of  firing  missiles  at
right-angles to reality."
 
This is another example of the fact that The Hitch Hiker's  Guide
to  the  Galaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in
off the street and get ripped off, especially if they  happen  to
walk in off the street during the afternoon, when very few of the
regular staff are there.
 
There is a fundamental point here.
 
The history of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy  is  one  of
idealism,  struggle,  despair,  passion,  success,  failure,  and
enormously long lunch-breaks.
 
The earliest origins of the Guide are now, along with most of its
financial records, lost in the mists of time.
 
For other, and more curious theories about where they  are  lost,
see below.
 
Most of the surviving  stories,  however,  speak  of  a  founding
editor called Hurling Frootmig.
 
Hurling Frootmig, it is said, founded the Guide, established  its
fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, and went bust.
 
There followed many years of penury  and  heart-searching  during
which  he  consulted  friends,  sat  in darkened rooms in illegal
states of mind, thought about this and that,  fooled  about  with
weights,  and  then,  after  a  chance  encounter  with  the Holy
Lunching Friars of Voondon (who claimed that just as lunch was at
the  centre of a man's temporal day, and man's temporal day could
be seen as an analogy for his spiritual life, so Lunch should
 
(a) be seen as the centre of a man's spiritual life, and
 
(b) be held in jolly nice restaurants), he refounded  the  Guide,
laid  down its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and
where you could stuff them both, and led  the  Guide  on  to  its
first major commercial success.
 
He also started to develop and explore the role of the  editorial
lunch-break which was subsequently to play such a crucial part in
the Guide's history, since it meant that most of the actual  work
got  done by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the
empty offices on an afternoon and saw something worth doing.
 
Shortly  after  this,  the  Guide  was  taken  over  by  Megadodo
Publications  of Ursa Minor Beta, thus putting the whole thing on
a very sound financial footing, and allowing the  fourth  editor,
Lig Lury Jr, to embark on lunch-breaks of such breathtaking scope
that even  the  efforts  of  recent  editors,  who  have  started
undertaking  sponsored  lunch-breaks  for charity, seem like mere
sandwiches in comparison.
 
In fact, Lig never formally resigned his editorship -  he  merely
left  his  office  late one morning and has never since returned.
Though well over a century has now passed, many  members  of  the
guide  staff  still retain the romantic notion that he has simply
popped out for a ham croissant, and will yet return to put  in  a
solid afternoon's work.
 
Strictly speaking, all editors since Lig Lury Jr  have  therefore
been designated Acting Editors, and Lig's desk is still preserved
the way he left it, with the addition of a small sign which  says
"Lig Lury Jr, Editor, Missing, presumed Fed".
 
Some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that
Lig   actually   perished  in  the  Guide's  first  extraordinary
experiments in alternative book-keeping. Very little is known  of
this,  and  less  still  said. Anyone who even notices, let alone
calls attention  to,  the  curious  but  utter  coincidental  and
meaningless fact that every world on which the Guide has ever set
up an accounting department has shortly  afterwards  perished  in
warfare  or  some  natural  disaster,  is  liable  to get sued to
smithereens.
 
It is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that  the  two
or three days prior to the demolition of the planet Earth to make
way for a new hyperspace bypass saw a  dramatic  upsurge  in  the
number  of  UFO  sightings  there,  not  only above Lords Cricket
Ground in St. John's Wood, London, but also above Glastonbury  in
Somerset.
 
Glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings,
witchcraft,  ley-lines  an wart curing, and had now been selected
as the site for the new Hitch  Hiker's  Guide  financial  records
office,  and  indeed,  ten years' worth of financial records were
transferred to a magic hill just  outside  the  city  mere  hours
before the Vogons arrived.
 
None of these facts,  however  strange  or  inexplicable,  is  as
strange  or  inexplicable  as  the  rules of the game of Brockian
Ultra-Cricket, as played in the higher dimensions. A full set  of
rules  is  so  massively complicated that the only time they were
all  bound  together  in  a   single   volume,   they   underwent
gravitational collapse and became a Black Hole.
 
A brief summary, however, is as follows:
 
Rule One: Grow at least three extra legs. You  won't  need  them,
but it keeps the crowds amused.
 
Rule Two: Find one good Brockian Ultra-Cricket player. Clone  him
off  a  few  times.  This  saves  an  enormous  amount of tedious
selection and training.
 
Rule Three: Put your team and the opposing team in a large  field
and build a high wall round them.
 
The reason for this is that, though the game is a major spectator
sport,  the  frustration  experienced  by  the  audience  at  not
actually being able to see what's going on leads them to  imagine
that it's a lot more exciting than it really is. A crowd that has
just watched a rather humdrum game  experiences  far  less  life-
affirmation  than  a  crowd  that believes it has just missed the
most dramatic event in sporting history.
 
Rule Four: Throw lots of assorted  items  of  sporting  equipment
over  the  wall for the players. Anything will do - cricket bats,
basecube bats, tennis guns, skis, anything you  can  get  a  good
swing with.
 
Rule Five: The players should now lay about  themselves  for  all
they are worth with whatever they find to hand. Whenever a player
scores a "hit" on another player, he should immediately run  away
and apologize from a safe distance.
 
Apologies should be concise, sincere and, for maximum clarity and
points, delivered through a megaphone.
 
Rule Six: The winning team shall be the first team that wins.
 
Curiously enough, the more the obsession with the game  grows  in
the higher dimensions, the less it is actually played, since most
of the competing teams are now in a state  of  permanent  warfare
with  each  other over the interpretation of these rules. This is
all for the best, because in the long run a  good  solid  war  is
less  psychologically damaging than a protracted game of Brockian
Ultra-Cricket.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 20
 
As Arthur ran darting, dashing and panting down the side  of  the
mountain  he  suddenly  felt  the whole bulk of the mountain move
very, very slightly beneath him. There was a rumble, a roar,  and
a  slight  blurred  movement,  and a lick of heat in the distance
behind and above him. He ran in a frenzy of fear. The land  began
to  slide, and he suddenly felt the force of the word "landslide"
in a way which had never been apparent  to  him  before.  It  had
always  just  been  a  word  to  him, but now he was suddenly and
horribly aware that sliding is a strange and sickening thing  for
land to do. It was doing it with him on it. He felt ill with fear
and shaking. The ground slid, the mountain slurred,  he  slipped,
he fell, he stood, he slipped again and ran. The avalance began.
 
Stones, then rocks, then boulders which  pranced  past  him  like
clumsy  puppies,  only  much,  much bigger, much, much harder and
heavier, and almost infinitely more likely to kill  you  if  they
fell  on you. His eyes danced with them, his feet danced with the
dancing ground. He ran as if  running  was  a  terrible  sweating
sickness,  his  heart  pounded  to  the  rhythm  of  the pounding
geological frenzy around him.
 
The logic of the situation, i.e. that he  was  clearly  bound  to
survive  if  the  next  foreshadowed  incident in the saga of his
inadvertent persecution of Agrajag was  to  happen,  was  utterly
failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise any restraining
influence on him at this time. He ran with the fear of  death  in
him, under him, over him and grabbing hold of his hair.
 
And suddenly he tripped again  and  was  hurled  forward  by  his
considerable  momentum.  But just at the moment that he was about
to hit the ground astoundingly hard  he  saw  lying  directly  in
front of him a small navy-blue holdall that he knew for a fact he
had lost in the baggage-retrieval system at Athens  airport  some
ten  years  in  his  personal  time-scale  previously, and in his
astonishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed off  into
the air with his brain singing.
 
What he was doing was this: he was flying. He glanced around  him
in  surprise,  but  there could be no doubt that that was what he
was doing. No part of him was touching the ground, and no part of
him  was  even  approaching it. He was simply floating there with
boulders hurtling through the air around him.
 
He could now do something about  that.  Blinking  with  the  non-
effort  of it he wafted higher into the air, and now the boulders
were hurtling through the air beneath him.
 
He looked downwards with intense curiosity. Between him  and  the
shivering  ground  were  now some thirty feet of empty air, empty
that is if you discounted the boulders which didn't  stay  in  it
for  long,  but  bounded downwards in the iron grip of the law of
gravity; the same law which seemed, all  of  a  sudden,  to  have
given Arthur a sabbatical.
 
It  occurred  to  him  almost  instantly,  with  the  instinctive
correctness  that self-preservation  instils in the mind, that he
mustn't try to think about it, that if he did, the law of gravity
would suddenly glance sharply in his direction and demand to know
what the hell he thought he was doing up  there,  and  all  would
suddenly be lost.
 
So he thought about tulips. It was  difficult,  but  he  did.  He
thought  about  the  pleasing  firm  roundness  of  the bottom of
tulips, he thought about the interesting variety of colours  they
came  in,  and  wondered  what  proportion of the total number of
tulips that grew, or had grown,  on  the  Earth  would  be  found
within a radius of one mile from a windmill. After a while he got
dangerously bored with  this  train  of  thought,  felt  the  air
slipping  away  beneath  him, felt that he was drifting down into
the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was trying so hard not
to  think about, so he thought about Athens airport for a bit and
that kept him usefully annoyed for about five minutes  -  at  the
end of which he was startled to discover that he was now floating
about two hundred yards above the ground.
 
He wondered for a moment how he was going to get back down to it,
but instantly shied away from that area of speculation again, and
tried to look at the situation steadily.
 
He was flying, What was he going to do about it? He  looked  back
down  at  the ground. He didn't look at it hard, but did his best
just to give it an idle glance, as it  were,  in  passing.  There
were  a  couple of things he couldn't help noticing. One was that
the eruption of the mountain seemed now to have  spent  itself  -
there was a crater just a little way beneath the peak, presumably
where the rock  had  caved  in  on  top  of  the  huge  cavernous
cathedral,  the statue of himself, and the sadly abused figure of
Agrajag.
 
The other was his  hold-all,  the  one  he  had  lost  at  Athens
airport.  It  was  sitting  pertly  on  a  piece of clear ground,
surrounded by exhausted boulders but apparently hit  by  none  of
them.  Why  this should be he could not speculate, but since this
mystery   was   completely   overshadowed   by   the    monstrous
impossibility of the bag's being there in the first place, it was
not a speculation he really felt strong enough  for  anyway.  The
thing  is,  it  was  there.  And the nasty, fake leopard-skin bag
seemed to have disappeared, which was all to  the  good,  if  not
entirely to the explicable.
 
He was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick  the
thing  up.  Here he was, flying along two hundred yards above the
surface of an alien planet the name of  which  he  couldn't  even
remember.  He could not ignore the plaintive posture of this tiny
piece of what used to be his life, here, so many light-years from
the pulverized remains of his home.
 
Furthermore, he realized, the bag, if it was still in  the  state
in  which  he lost it, would contain a can which would have in it
the only Greek olive oil still surviving in the Universe.
 
Slowly, carefully, inch by  inch,  he  began  to  bob  downwards,
swinging  gently  from side to side like a nervous sheet of paper
feeling its way towards the ground.
 
It went well, he was feeling good. The air supported him, but let
him  through.  Two  minutes later he was hovering a mere two feet
above the bag, and was faced with  some  difficult  decision.  He
bobbed  there  lightly.  He  frowned, but again, as lightly as he
could.
 
If he picked the bag up, could he carry it?  Mightn't  the  extra
weight just pull him straight to the ground?
 
Mightn't the  mere  act  of  touching  something  on  the  ground
suddenly  discharge   whatever  mysterious  force it was that was
holding him in the air?
 
Mightn't he be better off just being sensible at this  point  and
stepping  out  of  the air, back on to the ground for a moment or
two?
 
If he did, would he ever be able to fly again?
 
The sensation, when he allowed himself to be aware of it, was  so
quietly ecstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it,
perhaps for ever. With this worry in mind  he  bobbed  upwards  a
little  again,  just  to  try  the feel of it, the surprising and
effortless movement of it. He bobbed,  he  floated.  He  tried  a
little swoop.
 
The swoop was terrific. With his arms spread out in front of him,
his  hair  and  dressing  gown streaming out behind him, he dived
down out of the sky, bellied along a body of air about  two  feet
from  the ground and swung back up again, catching himself at the
top of the swing and holding. Just holding. He stayed there.
 
It was wonderful.
 
And that, he realized, was the way of  picking  up  the  bag.  He
would  swoop  down  and catch hold of it just at the point of the
upswing. He would carry it on up with him. He might wobble a bit,
but he was certain that he could hold it.
 
He tried one or two more practice swoops, and they got better and
better. The air on his face, the bounce and woof of his body, all
combined to make him feel an intoxication of the spirit  that  he
hadn't  felt  since,  since  -  well as far as he could work out,
since he was born. He drifted away on the breeze and surveyed the
countryside,  which  was,  he  discovered, pretty nasty. It had a
wasted ravaged look. He decided not to look at it  any  more.  He
would  just  pick  up the bag and then ... he didn't know what he
was going to do after he had picked up the  bag.  He  decided  he
would just pick up the bag and see where things went from there.
 
He judged himself against the wind,  pushed  up  against  it  and
turned around. He floated on its body. He didn't realize, but his
body was willoming at this point.
 
He ducked down under the airstream, dipped - and dived.
 
The air threw itself past him, he thrilled through it. The ground
wobbled uncertainly, straightened its ideas out and rose smoothly
up to meet him, offering the bag, its cracked plastic handles  up
towards him.
 
Halfway down there was a sudden dangerous moment when he could no
longer  believe  he  was doing this, and therefore he very nearly
wasn't, but he  recovered  himself  in  time,  skimmed  over  the
ground,  slipped  an arm smoothly through the handles of the bag,
and began to climb back up, couldn't make it and all of a  sudden
collapsed, bruised, scratched and shaking in the stony ground.
 
He staggered instantly to his feet and swayed hopelessly  around,
swinging the bag round him in agony of grief and disappointment.
 
His feet, suddenly, were stuck heavily to the ground in  the  way
they  always  had  been. His body seemed like an unwieldy sack of
potatoes that reeled stumbling against the ground, his  mind  had
all the lightness of a bag of lead.
 
He  sagged  and  swayed  and  ached  with  giddiness.  He   tried
hopelessly  to  run,  but  his  legs  were  suddenly too weak. He
tripped and flopped forward. At that moment he remembered that in
the bag he was now carrying was not only a can of Greek olive oil
but a duty-free allowance of  retsina,  and  in  the  pleasurable
shock  of  that  realization he failed to notice for at least ten
seconds that he was now flying again.
 
He whooped and cried with relief and pleasure, and sheer physical
delight.  He  swooped, he wheeled, he skidded and whirled through
the air. Cheekily he sat on an updraught  and  went  through  the
contents  of  the  hold-all. He felt the way he imagined an angel
must feel during its celebrated dance on the head of a pin whilst
being  counted  by  philosophers. He laughed with pleasure at the
discovery that the bag did in fact contain the olive oil and  the
retsina as well as a pair of cracked sunglasses, some sand-filled
swimming trunks, some creased postcards of Santorini, a large and
unsightly  towel,  some interesting stones, and various scraps of
paper with the addresses of people he was relieved  to  think  he
would  never meet again, even if the reason why was a sad one. He
dropped the stones, put on the sunglasses, and let the pieces  of
paper whip away in the wind.
 
Ten minutes later, drifting idly through a cloud, he got a  large
and  extremely  disreputable  cocktail  party in the small of the
back.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 21
 
The longest and most destructive party ever held is now into  its
fourth  generation,  and still no one shows any signs of leaving.
Somebody did once look at his watch, but that  was  eleven  years
ago, and there has been no follow-up.
 
The mess is extraordinary, and has to be seen to be believed, but
if  you  don't have any particular need to believe it, then don't
go and look, because you won't enjoy it.
 
There have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds,
and  there  is  one  theory  that  this  is a battle being fought
between the fleets of several rival carpet-cleaning companies who
are  hovering  over  the  thing  like vultures, but you shouldn't
believe anything  you  hear  at  parties,  and  particularly  not
anything you hear at this one.
 
One of the problems, and it's one which is obviously going to get
worse,  is  that  all  the  people  at  the  party are either the
children or the grandchildren or the great-grandchildren  of  the
people  who wouldn't leave in the first place, and because of all
the business about selective breeding and regressive genes and so
on,  it  means  that  all  the people now at the party are either
absolutely fanatical partygoers, or gibbering  idiots,  or,  more
and more frequently, both.
 
Either way, it means that, genetically speaking, each  succeeding
generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one.
 
So other factors come into operation,  like  when  the  drink  is
going to run out.
 
Now, because of certain things which have happened  which  seemed
like  a  good  idea  at  the time (and one of the problems with a
party which never stops is that all the things  which  only  seem
like  a  good  idea at parties continue to seem like good ideas),
that point seems still to be a long way off.
 
One of the things which seemed like a good idea at the  time  was
that  the party should fly - not in the normal sense that parties
are meant to fly, but literally.
 
One night, long ago, a band of  drunken  astro-engineers  of  the
first  generation  clambered  round  the  building  digging this,
fixing that, banging very hard on the other and when the sun rose
the  following morning, it was startled to find itself shining on
a building full of happy drunken people which  was  now  floating
like a young and uncertain bird over the treetops.
 
Not only that, but the flying  party  had  also  managed  to  arm
itself  rather heavily. If they were going to get involved in any
petty arguments with wine merchants, they  wanted  to  make  sure
they had might on their side.
 
The transition from full-time cocktail party to part-time raiding
party  came with ease, and did much to add that extra bit of zest
and swing to the whole affair which  was  badly  needed  at  this
point  because  of the enormous number of times that the band had
already played all the numbers it knew over the years.
 
They looted, they raided, they held whole cities for  ransom  for
fresh  supplies  of  cheese crackers, avocado dip, spare ribs and
wine and spirits, which would now get piped aboard from  floating
tankers.
 
The problem of when the drink is going to run  out  is,  however,
going to have to be faced one day.
 
The planet over which they are floating is no longer  the  planet
it was when they first started floating over it.
 
It is in bad shape.
 
The party had attacked and raided an awful lot of it, and no  one
has  ever succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and
unpredictable way in which it lurches round the sky.
 
It is one hell of a party.
 
It is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of  the
back.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 22
 
 Arthur lay  floundering  in  pain  on  a  piece  of  ripped  and
dismembered  reinforced  concrete, flicked at by wisps of passing
cloud and confused by the sounds of flabby merrymaking  somewhere
indistinctly behind him.
 
There was  a  sound  he  couldn't  immediately  identify,  partly
because  he  didn't  know the tune "I Left my Leg in Jaglan Beta"
and partly because the band playing it were very tired, and  some
members  of  it were playing it in three-four time, some in four-
four, and some in a kind of pie-eyed r2,  each according  to  the
amount of sleep he'd managed to grab recently.
 
He lay, panting heavily in the wet air, and tried feeling bits of
himself  to  see  where  he  might  be  hurt. Wherever he touched
himself, he encountered a pain. After a short while he worked out
that this was because it was his hand that was hurting. He seemed
to have sprained his wrist. His back, too, was  hurting,  but  he
soon  satisfied  himself  that  he  was  not badly hurt, but just
bruised and a little shaken, as  who  wouldn't  be?  He  couldn't
understand  what  a  building  would  be doing flying through the
clouds.
 
On the other hand, he would have been a  little  hard-pressed  to
come  up  with any convincing explanation of his own presence, so
he decided that he and the building were just going  to  have  to
accept  each  other. He looked up from where he was lying. A wall
of pale but stained stone slabs rose up behind him, the  building
proper.  He  seemed  to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or
lip which extended outwards for about three or four feet all  the
way  around.  It  was  a  hunk  of  the ground in which the party
building had had its foundations, and which it  had  taken  along
with itself to keep itself bound together at the bottom end.
 
Nervously, he stood up and, suddenly, looking out over the  edge,
he  felt  nauseous  with vertigo. He pressed himself back against
the wall,  wet  with  mist  and  sweat.  His  head  was  swimming
freestyle, but someone in his stomach was doing the butterfly.
 
Even though he had got up here under his own power, he could  now
not even bear to contemplate the hideous drop in front of him. He
was not about to try his luck jumping. He was not about  to  move
an inch closer to the edge.
 
Clutching his hold-all he edged along the wall, hoping to find  a
doorway  in. The solid weight of the can of olive oil was a great
reassurance to him.
 
He was edging in the direction of the nearest corner, in the hope
that  the  wall  around the corner might offer more in the way of
entrances than this one, which offered none.
 
The unsteadiness of the building's flight made him feel sick with
fear,  and  after a short while he took the towel from out of his
hold-all and did something with it which once again justified its
supreme  position  in  the list of useful things to take with you
when you hitch-hike round the Galaxy. He put it over his head  so
he wouldn't have to see what he was doing.
 
His feet edged along the  ground.  His  outstretched  hand  edged
along the wall.
 
Finally he came to the corner, and as his hand rounded the corner
it  encountered  something  which  gave  him such a shock that he
nearly fell straight off. It was another hand.
 
The two hands gripped each other.
 
He desperately wanted to use his other hand  to  pull  the  towel
back  from  his  eyes,  but  it was holding the hold-all with the
olive oil, the retsina and the postcards from Santorini,  and  he
very much didn't want to put it down.
 
He experienced one of those "self" moments, one of those  moments
when you suddenly turn around and look at yourself and think "Who
am I? What am I up to? What have I achieved? Am I doing well?" He
whimpered very slightly.
 
He tried to free his hand, but he couldn't. The  other  hand  was
holding  his  tightly.  He  had  no  recourse but to edge onwards
towards the corner. He leaned around it and shook his head in  an
attempt to dislodge the towel. This seemed to provoke a sharp cry
of some unfashionable emotion from the owner of the other hand.
 
The towel was whipped from his head and he found his eyes peering
into  those of Ford Prefect. Beyond him stood Slartibartfast, and
beyond them he could clearly see a porchway and  a  large  closed
door.
 
They were both pressed back against  the  wall,  eyes  wild  with
terror as they stared out into the thick blind cloud around them,
and tried to resist the lurching and swaying of the building.
 
"Where the zarking photon have  you  been?"  hissed  Ford,  panic
stricken.
 
"Er, well," stuttered Arthur, not really knowing how  to  sum  it
all up that briefly. "Here and there. What are you doing here?"
 
Ford turned his wild eyes on Arthur again.
 
"They won't let us in without a bottle," he hissed.
 
The first thing Arthur noticed as they entered into the thick  of
the  party,  apart from the noise, the suffocating heat, the wild
profusion of colours that protuded dimly through  the  atmosphere
of  heavy  smoke,  the  carpets  thick with ground glass, ash and
avocado  droppings,  and  the  small  group  of  pterodactyl-like
creatures  in  lurex  who  descended  on  his cherished bottle of
retsina,  squawking,  "A  new  pleasure,  a  new  pleasure",  was
Trillian being chatted up by a Thunder God.
 
"Didn't I see you at Milliways?" he was saying.
 
"Were you the one with the hammer?"
 
"Yes. I much prefer it here. So much less reputable, so much more
fraught."
 
Squeals of some hideous pleasure rang around the room, the  outer
dimensions  of which were invisible through the heaving throng of
happy, noisy creatures, cheerfully  yelling  things  that  nobody
could hear at each other and occasionally having crises.
 
"Seems fun," said Trillian. "What did you say, Arthur?"
 
"I said, how the hell did you get here?"
 
"I was a row of dots flowing randomly through the Universe.  Have
you met Thor? He makes thunder."
 
"Hello," said Arthur. "I expect that must be very interesting."
 
"Hi," said Thor. "It is. Have you got a drink?"
 
"Er, no actually ..."
 
"Then why don't you go and get one?"
 
"See you later, Arthur," said Trillian.
 
Something jogged Arthur's mind, and he looked around huntedly.
 
"Zaphod isn't here, is he?" he said.
 
"See you," said Trillian firmly, "later."
 
Thor glared at him with hard coal-black eyes, his beard bristled,
what  little light was there was in the place mustered its forces
briefly to glint menacingly off the horns of his helmet.
 
He took Trillian's elbow in his  extremely  large  hand  and  the
muscles in his upper arm moved around each other like a couple of
Volkswagens parking.
 
He led her away.
 
"One of the interesting things about being  immortal,"  he  said,
"is ..."
 
"One  of  the  interesting  things  about  space,"  Arthur  heard
Slartibartfast  saying  to  a  large  and voluminous creature who
looked like someone losing a fight with  a  pink  duvet  and  was
gazing  raptly  at  the old man's deep eyes and silver beard, "is
how dull it is."
 
"Dull?" said the creature, and blinked her  rather  wrinkled  and
bloodshot eyes.
 
"Yes," said Slartibartfast, "staggeringly dull. Bewilderingly so.
You  see,  there's  so  much of it and so little in it. Would you
like me to quote some statistics?"
 
"Er, well ..."
 
"Please, I would like to.  They,  too,  are  quite  sensationally
dull."
 
"I'll come back and hear them in a moment," she said, patting him
on  the arm, lifted up her skirts like a hovercraft and moved off
into the heaving crown.
 
"I thought she'd never go," growled the old man. "Come,  Earthman
..."
 
"Arthur."
 
"We must find the Silver Bail, it is here somewhere."
 
"Can't we just relax a little?" Arthur said. "I've  had  a  tough
day.  Trillian's  here,  incidentally,  she  didn't  say  how, it
probably doesn't matter."
 
"Think of the danger to the Universe ..."
 
"The Universe," said Arthur, "is big enough  and  old  enough  to
look  after  itself  for  half  an hour. All right," he added, in
response to Slartibartfast's increasing agitation,  "I'll  wander
round and see if anybody's seen it."
 
"Good, good," said Slartibartfast, "good. " He plunged  into  the
crowd himself, and was told to relax by everybody he passed.
 
"Have you seen a bail anywhere?" said Arthur to a little man  who
seemed  to  be  standing  eagerly  waiting to listen to somebody.
"It's made of silver, vitally important for the future safety  of
the Universe, and about this long."
 
"No," said the enthusiastically wizened little man, "but do  have
a drink and tell me all about it."
 
Ford Prefect writhed past,  dancing  a  wild,  frenetic  and  not
entirely  unobscene  dance  with someone who looked as if she was
wearing Sydney Opera House on her head. He was yelling  a  futile
conversation at her above the din.
 
"I like that hat!" he bawled.
 
"What?"
 
"I said, I like the hat."
 
"I'm not wearing a hat."
 
"Well, I like the head, then."
 
"What?"
 
"I said, I like the head. Interesting bone-structure."
 
"What?"
 
Ford worked a shrug into the complex routine of  other  movements
he was performing.
 
"I said, you dance great," he shouted, "just don't nod so much."
 
"What?"
 
"It's just that every time you nod,"  said  Ford,  "...  ow!"  he
added as his partner nodded forward to say "What?" and once again
pecked him sharply on the forehead with  the  sharp  end  of  her
swept-forward skull.
 
"My planet was blown up one morning," said Arthur, who had  found
himself  quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story
or, at least, edited highlights of it, "that's  why  I'm  dressed
like  this,  in my dressing gown. My planet was blown up with all
my clothes in it, you see. I didn't realize I'd be  coming  to  a
party."
 
The little man nodded enthusiastically.
 
"Later, I was thrown off a spaceship. Still in my dressing  gown.
Rather  than  the  space  suit one would normally expect. Shortly
after that I discovered that my planet had originally  been built
for a bunch of mice. You can imagine how I felt about that. I was
then shot at for a while and blown up. In fact I have been  blown
up    ridiculously    often,   shot   at,   insulted,   regularly
disintegrated, deprived of tea, and recently  I  crashed  into  a
swamp and had to spend five years in a damp cave."
 
"Ah," effervesced the little man, "and did you have  a  wonderful
time?"
 
Arthur started to choke violently on his drink.
 
"What a wonderful exciting cough," said  the  little  man,  quite
startled by it, "do you mind if I join you?"
 
And with  that  he  launched  into  the  most  extraordinary  and
spectacular  fit  of  coughing  which  caught  Arthur  so much by
surprise that he started to choke violently,  discovered  he  was
already doing it and got thoroughly confused.
 
Together they performed a lung-busting duet  which  went  on  for
fully  two minutes before Arthur managed to cough and splutter to
a halt.
 
"So invigorating," said the little man, panting and wiping  tears
from  his  eyes.  "What an exciting life you must lead. Thank you
very much."
 
He shook Arthur warmly by the hand and walked off into the crowd.
Arthur shook his head in astonishment.
 
A youngish-looking man came up to him, an aggressive-looking type
with  a  hook  mouth,  a  lantern  nose,  and  small beady little
cheekbones. He was wearing black trousers,  a  black  silk  shirt
open  to  what was presumably his navel, though Arthur had learnt
never to make assumptions about the  anatomies  of  the  sort  of
people  he  tended to meet these days, and had all sorts of nasty
dangly gold things hanging round his neck. He  carried  something
in  a  black  bag,  and  clearly  wanted people to notice that he
didn't want them to notice it.
 
"Hey, er, did I hear you say your name just now?" he said.
 
This was one  of  the  many  things  that  Arthur  had  told  the
enthusiastic little man.
 
"Yes, it's Arthur Dent."
 
The man seemed to be dancing slightly to some rhythm  other  than
any of the several that the band were grimly pushing out.
 
"Yeah," he said, "only there was a man in a  mountain  wanted  to
see you."
 
"I met him."
 
"Yeah, only he seemed pretty anxious about it, you know."
 
"Yes, I met him."
 
"Yeah, well I think you should know that."
 
"I do. I met him."
 
The man paused to chew a little gum. Then he  clapped  Arthur  on
the back.
 
"OK," he said, "all right. I'm  just  telling  you,  right?  Good
night, good luck, win awards."
 
"What?" said Arthur, who was beginning to flounder  seriously  at
this point.
 
"Whatever. Do what you do.  Do  it  well."  He  made  a  sort  of
clucking noise with whatever he was chewing and then some vaguely
dynamic gesture.
 
"Why?" said Arthur.
 
"Do it badly," said the man, "who cares? Who gives a  shit?"  The
blood  suddenly seemed to pump angrily into the man's face and he
started to shout.
 
"Why not go mad?" he said. "Go away, get off my  back  will  you,
guy. Just zark off!!!"
 
"OK, I'm going," said Arthur hurriedly.
 
"It's been real." The man gave a sharp wave and  disappeared  off
into the throng.
 
"What was that about?" said Arthur to a girl  he  found  standing
beside him. "Why did he tell me to win awards?"
 
"Just showbiz talk," shrugged the girl. "He's just won  an  award
at  the  Annual Ursa Minor Alpha Recreational Illusions Institute
Awards Ceremony, and was  hoping  to  be  able  to  pass  it  off
lightly, only you didn't mention it, so he couldn't."
 
"Oh," said Arthur, "oh, well I'm sorry  I  didn't.  What  was  it
for?"
 
"The Most  Gratuitous  Use  Of  The  Word  `Fuck'  In  A  Serious
Screenplay. It's very prestigious."
 
"I see," said Arthur, "yes, and what do you get for that?"
 
"A Rory. It's just a small silver thing  set  on  a  large  black
base. What did you say?"
 
"I didn't say anything. I was just about to ask what  the  silver
..."
 
"Oh, I thought you said `wop'."
 
"Said what?"
 
"Wop."
 
People had been dropping in on the  party  now  for  some  years,
fashionable  gatecrashers from other worlds, and for some time it
had occurred to the partygoers as they had looked  out  at  their
own  world  beneath  them,  with  its wrecked cities, its ravaged
avocado farms and blighted vineyards,  its  vast  tracts  of  new
desert,  its  seas  full  of biscuit crumbs and worse, that their
world was in some tiny and almost imperceptible ways not quite as
much fun as it had been. Some of them had begun to wonder if they
could manage to stay sober for long enough  to  make  the  entire
party  spaceworthy  and  maybe take it off to some other people's
worlds where the  air  might  be  fresher  and  give  them  fewer
headaches.
 
The few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out a
feeble  existence on the half-dead ground of the planet's surface
would have been extremely pleased to hear this, but that day,  as
the party came screaming out of the clouds and the farmers looked
up in haggard fear of yet another cheese-and-wine raid, it became
clear  that the party was not going to be going anywhere else for
a while, that the party would soon be over. Very soon it would be
time  to gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to
find out what time of day it was, what time of year it  was,  and
whether  in  any  of this burnt and ravaged land there was a taxi
going anywhere.
 
The party was locked in a horrible embrace with a  strange  white
spaceship  which  seemed to be half sticking through it. Together
they were lurching, heaving and spinning their way round the  sky
in grotesque disregard of their own weight.
 
The clouds parted. The air roared and leapt out of their way.
 
The party and the Krikkit warship looked, in their  writhings,  a
little  like  two  ducks,  one of which is trying to make a third
duck inside the second duck, whilst the  second  duck  is  trying
very  hard to explain that it doesn't feel ready for a third duck
right now, is uncertain that it would  want  any  putative  third
duck  to  be  made  by  this  particular  first  duck anyway, and
certainly not whilst it, the second duck, was busy flying.
 
The sky sang and screamed with the rage of it  all  and  buffeted
the ground with shock waves.
 
And suddenly, with a foop, the Krikkit ship was gone.
 
The party blundered helplessly across the sky like a man  leaning
against  an  unexpectedly  open  door. It span and wobbled on its
hover jets. It tried to right itself and wronged itself  instead.
It staggered back across the sky again.
 
For a while these staggerings continued, but clearly  they  could
not  continue  for  long.  The  party  was now a mortally wounded
party. All the fun had gone out of it, as the occasional  broken-
backed pirouette could not disguise.
 
The longer, at this  point,  that  it  avoided  the  ground,  the
heavier was going to be the crash when finally it hit it.
 
Inside, things were  not  going  well  either.  They  were  going
monstrously  badly, in fact, and people were hating it and saying
so loudly. The Krikkit robots had been.
 
They had removed the Award for The Most  Gratuitous  Use  Of  The
Word  `Fuck' In A Serious Screenplay, and in its place had left a
scene of devastation that left Arthur feeling almost as sick as a
runner-up for a Rory.
 
"We would love to stay and help," shouted Ford, picking  his  way
over the mangled debris, "only we're not going to."
 
The party lurched again, provoking feverish cries and groans from
amongst the smoking wreckage.
 
"We have to go and save the Universe, you see," said  Ford.  "And
if  that sounds like a pretty lame excuse, then you may be right.
Either way, we're off."
 
He suddenly came across an unopened  bottle  lying,  miraculously
unbroken, on the ground.
 
"Do you mind if we take this?" he said.  "You  won't  be  needing
it."
 
He took a packet of potato crisps too.
 
"Trillian?" shouted Arthur in a shocked and  weakened  voice.  In
the smoking mess he could see nothing.
 
"Earthman, we must go," said Slartibartfast nervously.
 
"Trillian?" shouted Arthur again.
 
A moment or two later, Trillian staggered,  shaking,  into  view,
supported by her new friend the Thunder God.
 
"The girl stays with me," said Thor. "There's a great party going
on in Valhalla, we'll be flying off ..."
 
"Where were you when all this was going on?" said Arthur.
 
"Upstairs," said Thor, "I was weighing  her.  Flying's  a  tricky
business you see, you have to calculate wind ..."
 
"She comes with us," said Arthur.
 
"Hey," said Trillian, "don't I ..."
 
"No," said Arthur, "you come with us."
 
Thor looked at him with slowly smouldering eyes.  He  was  making
some  point  about  godliness and it had nothing to do with being
clean.
 
"She comes with me," he said quietly.
 
"Come on, Earthman," said Slartibartfast  nervously,  picking  at
Arthur's sleeve.
 
"Come on, Slartibartfast," said Ford, picking at  the  old  man's
sleeve. Slartibartfast had the teleport device.
 
The party lurched and swayed, sending  everyone  reeling,  except
for  Thor  and  except  for Arthur, who stared, shaking, into the
Thunder God's black eyes.
 
Slowly, incredibly, Arthur put up what appeared to  be  his  tiny
little fists.
 
"Want to make something of it?" he said.
 
"I beg your minuscule pardon?" roared Thor.
 
"I said," repeated Arthur, and he could not  keep  the  quavering
out  of  his  voice,  "do  you  want to make something of it?" He
waggled his fists ridiculously.
 
Thor looked at him with incredulity. Then a little wisp of  smoke
curled upwards from his nostril. There was a tiny little flame in
it too.
 
He gripped his belt.
 
He expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was  the
sort  of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of Sherpas
with you.
 
He unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt. He held it  up
in  his hands to reveal the massive iron head. He thus cleared up
any possible misunderstanding that  he  might  merely  have  been
carrying a telegraph pole around with him.
 
"Do I want," he said, with a hiss like a river flowing through  a
steel mill, "to make something of it?"
 
"Yes," said Arthur, his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong
and  belligerent.  He waggled his fists again, this time as if he
meant it.
 
"You want to step outside?" he snarled at Thor.
 
"All right!" bellowed Thor, like an enraged bull (or in fact like
an  enraged  Thunder God, which is a great deal more impressive),
and did so.
 
"Good," said Arthur, "that's got rid of him. Slarty, get  us  out
of here."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 23
 
"All right," shouted Ford at Arthur, "so I'm a coward, the  point
is   I'm  still  alive."  They  were  back  aboard  the  Starship
Bistromath, so was Slartibartfast, so was Trillian.  Harmony  and
concord were not.
 
"Well, so am I alive, aren't I?" retaliated Arthur, haggard  with
adventure  and anger. His eyebrows were leaping up and down as if
they wanted to punch each other.
 
"You damn nearly weren't," exploded Ford.
 
Arthur turned sharply to Slartibartfast, who was sitting  in  his
pilot  couch  on  the  flight  deck  gazing thoughtfully into the
bottom of a bottle which was telling  him  something  he  clearly
couldn't fathom. He appealed to him.
 
"Do you think he understands the first word I've been saying?" he
said, quivering with emotion.
 
"I don't know," replied Slartibartfast,  a  little  abstractedly.
"I'm  not sure," he added, glancing up very briefly, "that I do."
He stared at his instruments with renewed vigor  and  bafflement.
"You'll have to explain it to us again," he said.
 
"Well ..."
 
"But later. Terrible things are afoot."
 
He tapped the pseudo-glass of the bottle bottom.
 
"We fared rather pathetically at the party, I'm afraid," he said,
"and our only hope now is to try to prevent the robots from using
the Key in the Lock. How in heaven we do that I don't  know,"  he
muttered. "Just have to go there, I suppose. Can't say I like the
idea at all. Probably end up dead."
 
"Where is Trillian anyway?" said Arthur with a sudden affectation
of  unconcern.  What  he  had  been angry about was that Ford had
berated him for wasting time  over  all  the  business  with  the
Thunder  God when they could have been making a rather more rapid
escape. Arthur's own opinion, and he had offered it for  whatever
anybody  might  have  felt  it  was  worth,  was that he had been
extraordinarily brave and resourceful.
 
The prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth a
pair of fetid dingo's kidneys. What really hurt, though, was that
Trillian didn't seem to react much one way or the other  and  had
wandered off somewhere.
 
"And where are my potato crisps?" said Ford.
 
"They are both," said Slartibartfast, without looking up, "in the
Room  of  Informational  Illusions.  I think that your young lady
friend is trying to understand some problems of Galactic history.
I think the potato crisps are probably helping her."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 24
 
It is a mistake to think you can solve any  major  problems  just
with potatoes.
 
For instance, there was  once  an  insanely  aggressive  race  of
people  called  the  Silastic  Armorfiends of Striterax. That was
just the name of their race. The name of their army was something
quite  horrific. Luckily they lived even further back in Galactic
history than anything we have so far encountered - twenty billion
years  ago  - when the Galaxy was young and fresh, and every idea
worth fighting for was a new one.
 
And fighting was what the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax  were
good  at, and being good at it, they did a lot. They fought their
enemies (i.e. everybody else),  they  fought  each  other.  Their
planet  was  a  complete  wreck.  The  surface  was littered with
abandoned cities which were surrounded by abandoned war machines,
which  were  in  turn  surrounded  by  deep  bunkers in which the
Silastic Armorfiends lived and squabbled with each other.
 
The best way to pick a fight with a Silastic Armorfiend was  just
to  be born. They didn't like it, they got resentful. And when an
Armorfiend got resentful, someone got hurt. An exhausting way  of
life,  one might think, but they did seem to have an awful lot of
energy.
 
The best way of dealing with a Silastic Armorfiend was to put him
into  a  room of his own, because sooner or later he would simply
beat himself up.
 
Eventually they realized that this was something they were  going
to  have to sort out, and they passed a law decreeing that anyone
who had to carry a weapon as part of  his  normal  Silastic  work
(policemen,  security  guards, primary school teachers, etc.) had
to spend at least forty-five minutes every day punching a sack of
potatoes in order to work off his or her surplus aggressions.
 
For a while this worked well, until someone thought that it would
be  much more efficient and less time-consuming if they just shot
the potatoes instead.
 
This led to a  renewed  enthusiasm  for  shooting  all  sorts  of
things,  and  they  all got very excited at the prospect of their
first major war for weeks.
 
Another achievement of the Silastic Armorfiends of  Striterax  is
that  they  were  the  first  race  who  ever  managed to shock a
computer.
 
It was a gigantic spaceborne computer  called  Hactar,  which  to
this day is remembered as one of the most powerful ever built. It
was the first to be built like a natural  brain,  in  that  every
cellular  particle  of it carried the pattern of the whole within
it, which enabled it to think more  flexibly  and  imaginatively,
and also, it seemed, to be shocked.
 
The Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax  were  engaged  in  one  of
their  regular  wars  with the Strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and
were not enjoying it as much as  usual  because  it  involved  an
awful  lot of trekking through the Radiation Swamps of Cwulzenda,
and across the Fire Mountains  of  Frazfraga,  neither  of  which
terrains they felt at home in.
 
So when the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak joined  in  the
fray and forced them to fight another front in the Gamma Caves of
Carfrax and the Ice Storms of  Varlengooten,  they  decided  that
enough  was enough, and they ordered Hactar to design for them an
Ultimate Weapon.
 
"What do you mean," asked Hactar, "by Ultimate?"
 
To which the Silastic Armorfiends  of  Striterax  said,  "Read  a
bloody dictionary," and plunged back into the fray.
 
So Hactar designed an Ultimate Weapon.
 
It was a very, very small bomb which was simply a junction box in
hyperspace that would, when activated, connect the heart of every
major sun with the heart of every other major sun  simultaneously
and thus turn the entire Universe in to one gigantic hyperspatial
supernova.
 
When the Silastic Armorfiends tried  to  use  it  to  blow  up  a
Strangulous  Stilettan  munitions dump in one of the Gamma Caves,
they were extremely irritated that it didn't work, and said so.
 
Hactar had been shocked by the whole idea.
 
He tried to explain that he had been thinking about this Ultimate
Weapon business, and had worked out that there was no conceivable
consequence of not setting the bomb off that was worse  than  the
known  consequence  of setting it off, and he had therefore taken
the liberty of introducing a small flaw into the  design  of  the
bomb,  and  he  hoped  that  everyone  involved  would,  on sober
reflection, feel that ...
 
The Silastic Armorfiends disagreed and pulverized the computer.
 
Later they thought better of it, and destroyed the faulty bomb as
well.
 
Then, pausing only  to  smash  the  hell  out  of  the  Strenuous
Garfighters   of   Stug,   and   the  Strangulous  Stilettans  of
Jajazikstak, they went on to find an entirely new way of  blowing
themselves  up,  which  was a profound relief to everyone else in
the Galaxy, particularly the Garfighters, the Stilettans and  the
potatoes.
 
Trillian had watched all this, as well as the story  of  Krikkit.
She   emerged   from   the   Room   of   informational  Illusions
thoughtfully, just in time to discover that they had arrived  too
late.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 25
 
Even as the Starship Bistromath flickered into objective being on
the  top of a small cliff on the mile-wide asteroid which pursued
a lonely and eternal path  in  orbit  around  the  enclosed  star
system of Krikkit, its crew was aware that they were in time only
to be witnesses to an unstoppable historic event.
 
They didn't realize they were going to see two.
 
They stood cold, lonely  and  helpless  on  the  cliff  edge  and
watched  the  activity below. Lances of light wheeled in sinister
arcs against the void from a point only  about  a  hundred  yards
below and in front of them.
 
They stared into the blinding event.
 
An extension of the ship's field enabled them to stand there,  by
once  again  exploiting  the mind's predisposition to have tricks
played on it: the problems of falling up off the tiny mass of the
asteroid, or of not being able to breathe, simply became Somebody
Else's.
 
The white Krikkit warship was parked amongst the stark grey crags
of   the   asteroid,   alternately  flaring  under  arclights  or
disappearing in shadow. The blackness of the shaped shadows  cast
by  the  hard  rocks  danced together in wild choreography as the
arclights swept round them.
 
The eleven white robots were bearing, in procession,  the  Wikkit
Key out into the middle of a circle of swinging lights.
 
The Wikkit Key was rebuilt. Its components shone  and  glittered:
the  Steel  Pillar  (or  Marvin's leg) of Strength and Power, the
Gold Bail (or Heart of the Improbability  Drive)  of  Prosperity,
the  Perspex Pillar (or Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice) of Science
and  Reason,  the  Silver  Bail  (or  Rory  Award  for  The  Most
Gratuitous  Use  Of  The Word "Fuck" In A Serious Screenplay) and
the now reconstituted Wooden Pillar (or Ashes of  a  burnt  stump
signifying   the   death   of  English  cricket)  of  Nature  and
Spirituality.
 
"I suppose there is nothing we  can  do  at  this  point?"  asked
Arthur nervously.
 
"No," sighed Slartibartfast.
 
The expression of disappointment which crossed Arthur's face  was
a  complete  failure,  and,  since  he  was  standing obscured by
shadow, he allowed it to collapse into one of relief.
 
"Pity," he said.
 
"We have no weapons," said Slartibartfast, "stupidly."
 
"Damn," said Arthur very quietly.
 
Ford said nothing.
 
Trillian  said  nothing,  but  in  a  peculiarly  thoughtful  and
distinct  way.  She  was  staring  at  the blankness of the space
beyond the asteroid.
 
The asteroid circled the Dust Cloud which surrounded the Slo-Time
envelope  which  enclosed  the world on which lived the people of
Krikkit, the Masters of Krikkit and their killer robots.
 
The helpless group had no way  of  knowing  whether  or  not  the
Krikkit  robots  were  aware  of  their presence. They could only
assume that they must be, but that they felt,  quite  rightly  in
the  circumstances,  that  they  had nothing to fear. They had an
historic task to perform, and their audience  could  be  regarded
with contempt.
 
"Terrible impotent feeling,  isn't  it?"  said  Arthur,  but  the
others ignored him.
 
In the centre  of  the  area  of  light  which  the  robots  were
approaching,  a  square-shaped  crack appeared in the ground. The
crack defined itself more and more distinctly, and soon it became
clear  that  a  block  of  the ground, about six feet square, was
slowly rising.
 
At the same time they became aware of some other movement, but it
was  almost  sublimal,  and  for a moment or two it was not clear
what it was that was moving.
 
Then it became clear.
 
The asteroid was moving. It was moving slowly in towards the Dust
Cloud,  as if being hauled in inexorably by some celestial angler
in its depths.
 
They were to make in real life  the  journey  through  the  Cloud
which  they  had  already  made  in  the  Room  of  Informational
Illusions. They stood frozen in silence. Trillian frowned.
 
An age seemed to  pass.  Events  seemed  to  pass  with  spinning
slowness,  as  the  leading  edge of the asteroid passed into the
vague and soft outer perimeter of the Cloud.
 
And soon they were engulfed in a thin and dancing obscurity. They
passed  on through it, on and on, dimly aware of vague shapes and
whorls indistinguishable in the darkness except in the corner  of
the eye.
 
The Dust dimmed the shafts of  brilliant  light.  The  shafts  of
brilliant light twinkled on the myriad specks of Dust.
 
Trillian,  again,  regarded  the  passage  from  within  her  own
frowning thoughts.
 
And they were through it. Whether it had taken a minute  or  half
an  hour  they  weren't  sure,  but  they  were  through  it  and
confronted with a fresh blankness, as if space were  pinched  out
of existence in front of them.
 
And now things moved quickly.
 
A blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode  from  out  of
the  block  which had risen three feet out of the ground, and out
of that rose a smaller  Perspex  block,  dazzling  with  interior
dancing colours.
 
The block was slotted with deep groves,  three  upright  and  two
across, clearly designed to accept the Wikkit key.
 
The robots approached the Lock, slotted the Key into its home and
stepped back again. The block twisted round of is own accord, and
space began to alter.
 
As space unpinched itself, it seemed  agonizingly  to  twist  the
eyes  of  the  watchers  in  their sockets. They found themselves
staring, blinded, at an unravelled sun  which  stood  now  before
them  where it seemed only seconds before there had not been even
empty space. It was  a  second  or  two  before  they  were  even
sufficiently  aware  of what had happened to throw their hands up
over their horrified blinded eyes. In that second  or  two,  they
were  aware  of a tiny speck moving slowly across the eye of that
sun.
 
They staggered back, and heard ringing in their ears the thin and
unexpected chant of the robots crying out in unison.
 
"Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit!"
 
The sound chilled them. It was harsh, it was cold, it was  empty,
it was mechanically dismal.
 
It was also triumphant.
 
They were so stunned by these two sensory shocks that they almost
missed the second historic event.
 
Zaphod Beeblebrox, the only man in history to  survive  a  direct
blast  attack  from  the  Krikkit  robots, ran out of the Krikkit
warship brandishing a Zap gun.
 
"OK," he cried, "the situation is totally  under  control  as  of
this moment in time."
 
The single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung
his  battleclub,  and connected it with the back of Zaphod's left
head.
 
"Who  the  zark  did  that?"  said  the  left  head,  and  lolled
sickeningly forward.
 
His right head gazed keenly into the middle distance.
 
"Who did what?" it said.
 
The club connected with the back of his right head.
 
Zaphod measured his length as  a  rather  strange  shape  on  the
ground.
 
Within a matter of seconds the whole event was over. A few blasts
from  the robots were sufficient to destroy the Lock for ever. It
split and melted and splayed its contents  brokenly.  The  robots
marched  grimly and, it almost seemed, in a slightly disheartened
manner, back into their warship which, with a "foop", was gone.
 
Trillian and Ford ran hectically round and down the steep incline
to the dark, still body of Zaphod Beeblebrox.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 26
 
"I don't know," said Zaphod, for what  seemed  to  him  like  the
thirty-seventh time, "they could have killed me, but they didn't.
Maybe they just  thought  I  was  a  kind  of  wonderful  guy  or
something. I could understand that."
 
The others silently registered their opinions of this theory.
 
Zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight deck. His back  seemed
to  wrestle  the  floor as pain thudded through him and banged at
his heads.
 
"I think," he whispered, "that  there  is  something  wrong  with
those anodized dudes, something fundamentally weird."
 
"They are programmed to kill everybody,"  Slartibartfast  pointed
out.
 
"That," wheezed Zaphod between the whacking thuds, "could be it."
He didn't seem altogether convinced.
 
"Hey, baby," he said to Trillian, hoping this would make  up  for
his previous behaviour.
 
"You all right?" she said gently.
 
"Yeah," he said, "I'm fine."
 
"Good," she said, and walked away to think.  She  stared  at  the
huge  visiscreen  over the flight couches and, twisting a switch,
she flipped local images over it. One image was the blankness  of
the  Dust  Cloud.  One  was  the  sun of Krikkit. One was Krikkit
itself. She flipped between them fiercely.
 
"Well, that's goodbye Galaxy, then," said  Arthur,  slapping  his
knees and standing up.
 
"No," said Slartibartfast, gravely. "Our  course  is  clear."  He
furrowed  his  brow until you could grow some of the smaller root
vegetables in it. He stood up, he paced  around.  When  he  spoke
again,  what  he  said  frightened him so much he had to sit down
again.
 
"We must go down to Krikkit," he said. A deep sigh shook his  old
frame and his eyes seemed almost to rattle in their sockets.
 
"Once again,"  he  said,  "we  have  failed  pathetically.  Quite
pathetically."
 
"That," said Ford quietly, "is because we don't  care  enough.  I
told you."
 
He swung his feet up on the instrument panel and picked  fitfully
at something on one of his fingernails.
 
"But unless we determine  to  take  action,"  said  the  old  man
querulously, as if struggling against something deeply insouciant
in his nature, "then we shall all be destroyed, we shall all die.
Surely we care about that?"
 
"Not enough to want to get killed over it," said Ford. He put  on
a  sort  of  hollow smile and flipped it round the room at anyone
who wanted to see it.
 
Slartibartfast  clearly  found  this  point  of  view   extremely
seductive and he fought against it. He turned again to Zaphod who
was gritting his teeth and sweating with the pain.
 
"You surely must have some idea," he said, "of  why  they  spared
your life. It seems most strange and unusual."
 
"I kind of think they didn't even know," shrugged Zaphod. "I told
you. They hit me with the most feeble blast, just knocked me out,
right? They lugged me into their ship, dumped me  into  a  corner
and  ignored me. Like they were embarrassed about me being there.
If I said anything they knocked me out again. We had  some  great
conversations.  `Hey  ...  ugh!'  `Hi  there  ... ugh!' `I wonder
...ugh!' Kept me amused for hours, you know." He winced again.
 
He was toying with something in his fingers. He held  it  up.  It
was  the Gold Bail - the Heart of Gold, the heart of the Infinite
Improbability Drive. Only that and the Wooden Pillar had survived
the destruction of the Lock intact.
 
"I hear your ship can move a bit," he said.  "So  how  would  you
like to zip me back to mine before you ..."
 
"Will you not help us?" said Slartibartfast.
 
"I'd love to stay and help you save the Galaxy," insisted Zaphod,
rising himself up on to his shoulders, "but I have the mother and
father of a pair of  headaches,  and  I  feel  a  lot  of  little
headaches coming on. But next time it needs saving, I'm your guy.
Hey, Trillian baby?"
 
She looked round briefly.
 
"Yes?"
 
"You want to come? Heart of Gold? Excitement  and  adventure  and
really wild things?"
 
"I'm going down to Krikkit," she said.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 27
 
It was the same hill, and yet not the same.
 
This time it was not an Informational Illusion. This was  Krikkit
itself and they were standing on it. Near them, behind the trees,
stood the strange Italian restaurant  which  had  brought  these,
their real bodies, to this, the real, present world of Krikkit.
 
The strong grass under their feet was real, the  rich  soil  real
too.  The  heady  fragrances  from  the tree, too, were real. The
night was real night.
 
Krikkit.
 
Possibly the most dangerous place in the Galaxy  for  anyone  who
isn't  a Krikkiter to stand. The place that could not countenance
the existence of any other  place,  whose  charming,  delightful,
intelligent  inhabitants  would  howl  with  fear,  savagery  and
murderous hate when confronted with anyone not their own.
 
Arthur shuddered.
 
Slartibartfast shuddered.
 
Ford, surprisingly, shuddered.
 
It was not surprising that he shuddered, it was  surprising  that
he  was  there  at  all. But when they had returned Zaphod to his
ship Ford had felt unexpectedly shamed into not running away.
 
Wrong, he thought to himself, wrong wrong  wrong.  He  hugged  to
himself  one of the Zap guns with which they had armed themselves
out of Zaphod's armoury.
 
Trillian shuddered, and frowned as she looked into the sky.
 
This, too, was not the same. It was no longer blank and empty.
 
Whilst the countryside around them had changed little in the  two
thousand  years of the Krikkit wars, and the mere five years that
had elapsed locally since Krikkit  was  sealed  in  its  Slo-Time
envelope   ten  billion  years  ago,  the  sky  was  dramatically
different.
 
Dim lights and heavy shapes hung in it.
 
High in the sky, where no Krikkiter ever  looked,  were  the  War
Zones,  the Robot Zones - huge warships and tower blocks floating
in the Nil-O-Grav fields far above the idyllic pastoral lands  of
the surface of Krikkit.
 
Trillian stared at them and thought.
 
"Trillian," whispered Ford Prefect to her.
 
"Yes?" she said.
 
"What are you doing?"
 
"Thinking."
 
"Do you always breathe like that when you're thinking?"
 
"I wasn't aware that I was breathing."
 
"That's what worried me."
 
"I think I know ..." said Trillian.
 
"Shhhh!" said Slartibartfast in alarm,  and  his  thin  trembling
hand motioned them further back beneath the shadow of the tree.
 
Suddenly, as before in the tape, there were lights  coming  along
the  hill  path,  but  this  time the dancing beams were not from
lanterns but electric torches - not in itself a dramatic  change,
but  every  detail  made  their hearts thump with fear. This time
there were no lilting whimsical songs about flowers  and  farming
and dead dogs, but hushed voices in urgent debate.
 
A light moved in the sky with slow weight.  Arthur  was  clenched
with  a  claustrophobic  terror  and  the warm wind caught at his
throat.
 
Within seconds a second party became  visible,  approaching  from
the  other  side  of  the dark hill. They were moving swiftly and
purposefully, their torches swinging and probing around them.
 
The parties were clearly converging, and  not  merely  with  each
other. They were converging deliberately on the spot where Arthur
and the others were standing.
 
Arthur heard the slight rustle as Ford Prefect raised his Zap gun
to   his   shoulder,   and   the   slight   whimpering  cough  as
Slartibartfast raised his. He felt the cold unfamiliar weight  of
his own gun, and with shaking hands he raised it.
 
His fingers fumbled to release the safety catch  and  engage  the
extreme  danger  catch  as  Ford had shown him. He was shaking so
much that if he'd fired at anybody at  that  moment  he  probably
would have burnt his signature on them.
 
Only Trillian didn't raise her  gun.  She  raised  her  eyebrows,
lowered them again, and bit her lip in thought.
 
"Has it occurred to you," she began, but nobody wanted to discuss
anything much at the moment.
 
A light stabbed through the darkness from behind  them  and  they
span  around  to  find  a  third party of Krikkiters behind them,
searching them out with their torches.
 
Ford Prefect's gun crackled viciously, but fire spat back  at  it
and it crashed from his hands.
 
There was a moment of pure fear, a frozen  second  before  anyone
fired again.
 
And at the end of the second nobody fired.
 
They were surrounded  by  pale-faced  Krikkiters  and  bathed  in
bobbing torch light.
 
The captives stared at their captors, the captors stared at their
captives.
 
"Hello?" said one of the captors. "Excuse me,  but  are  you  ...
aliens?"
 
=================================================================
Chapter 28
 
Meanwhile,  more  millions  of  miles  away  than  the  mind  can
comfortably  encompass,  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  was  throwing a mood
again.
 
He had repaired his ship -  that  is,  he'd  watched  with  alert
interest  whilst  a service robot had repaired it for him. It was
now, once again, one of the most powerful and extraordinary ships
in  existence. He could go anywhere, do anything. He fiddled with
a book, and then tossed it away. It was the one he'd read before.
 
He walked over to the communications  bank  and  opened  an  all-
frequencies emergency channel.
 
"Anyone want a drink?" he said.
 
"This an emergency, feller?" crackled a voice from halfway across
the Galaxy.
 
"Got any mixers?" said Zaphod.
 
"Go take a ride on a comet."
 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod and flipped  the  channel  shut  again.  He
sighed  and  sat  down.  He  got  up again and wandered over to a
computer screen. He pushed a few buttons. Little blobs started to
rush around the screen eating each other.
 
"Pow!" said Zaphod. "Freeeoooo! Pop pop pop!"
 
"Hi there," said the computer brightly after a  minute  of  this,
"you have scored three points. Previous best score, seven million
five hundred and ninety-seven thousand, two hundred and ..."
 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod and flipped the screen blank again.
 
He sat down again. He played with a pencil. This too began slowly
to lose its fascination.
 
"OK, OK," he said, and fed his score and the  previous  one  into
the computer.
 
His ship made a blur of the Universe.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 29
 
"Tell us," said the thin, pale-faced Krikkiter  who  had  stepped
forward from the ranks of the others and stood uncertainly in the
circle of torchlight, handling his gun as if he was just  holding
it  for someone else who'd just popped off somewhere but would be
back in a minute, "do you know anything  about  something  called
the Balance of Nature?"
 
There was no reply from their captives, or at least nothing  more
articulate than a few confused mumbles and grunts. The torchlight
continued to play over them. High in  the  sky  above  them  dark
activity continued in the Robot zones.
 
"It's just," continued  the  Krikkiter  uneasily,  "something  we
heard  about,  probably  nothing  important. Well, I suppose we'd
better kill you then."
 
He looked down at his gun as if he was trying to find  which  bit
to press.
 
"That is," he said, looking up again,  "unless  there's  anything
you want to chat about?"
 
Slow, numb astonishment crept up the  bodies  of  Slartibartfast,
Ford  and  Arthur.  Very  soon it would reach their brains, which
were at the moment solely occupied with moving their jawbones  up
and  down. Trillian was shaking her head as if trying to finish a
jigsaw by shaking the box.
 
"We're worried, you see," said another man from the crowd, "about
this plan of universal destruction."
 
"Yes," added another, "and the balance of nature. It just  seemed
to  us that if the whole of the rest of the Universe is destroyed
it will somehow upset the balance of nature. We're quite keen  on
ecology, you see." His voice trailed away unhappily.
 
"And sport," said another, loudly. This got a cheer  of  approval
from the others.
 
"Yes," agreed the first, "and sport ..." He looked  back  at  his
fellows  uneasily  and scratched fitfully at his cheek. He seemed
to be wrestling with some deep inner confusion, as if  everything
he  wanted  to  say  and  everything  he  thought  were  entirely
different  things,  between  which  he  could  see  no   possible
connection.
 
"You see," he mumbled, "some of us  ..."  and  he  looked  around
again as if for confirmation. The others made encouraging noises.
"Some of us," he continued, "are  quite  keen  to  have  sporting
links  with  the  rest  of  the  Galaxy, and though I can see the
argument about keeping sport out of politics, I think that if  we
want to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy, which we
do, then it's probably a mistake to destroy it.  And  indeed  the
rest of the Universe ..." his voice trailed away again "... which
is what seems to be the idea now ..."
 
"Wh ..." said Slartibartfast. "Wh ..."
 
"Hhhh ... ?" said Arthur.
 
"Dr ..." said Ford Prefect.
 
"OK," said Trillian. "Let's talk about it."  She  walked  forward
and  took the poor confused Krikkiter by the arm. He looked about
twenty-five, which meant, because of the  peculiar  manglings  of
time that had been going on in this area, that he would have been
just twenty when the Krikkit  Wars  were  finished,  ten  billion
years ago.
 
Trillian led him for a short walk through the  torchlight  before
she  said  anything  more. He stumbled uncertainly after her. The
encircling torch beams were drooping now slightly as if they were
abdicating  to this strange, quiet girl who alone in the Universe
of dark confusion seemed to know what she was doing.
 
She turned and faced him, and lightly held both his arms. He  was
a picture of bewildered misery.
 
"Tell me," she said.
 
He said nothing for a moment, whilst his gaze darted from one  of
her eyes to the other.
 
"We ..." he said, "we have to be alone ... I think."  He  screwed
up  his  face  and then dropped his head forward, shaking it like
someone trying to shake a coin out of a money box. He  looked  up
again.  "We  have  this bomb now, you see," he said, "it's just a
little one."
 
"I know," she said.
 
He goggled at her as if she'd said something very  strange  about
beetroots.
 
"Honestly," he said, "it's very, very little."
 
"I know," she said again.
 
"But they say," his voice trailed on, "they say  it  can  destroy
everything that exists. And we have to do that, you see, I think.
Will that make us alone?  I  don't  know.  It  seems  to  be  our
function, though," he said, and dropped his head again.
 
"Whatever that means," said a hollow voice from the crowd.
 
Trillian slowly put her arms around  the  poor  bewildered  young
Krikkiter and patted his trembling head on her shoulder.
 
"It's all right," she said quietly but clearly enough for all the
shadowy crowd to hear, "you don't have to do it."
 
She rocked him.
 
"You don't have to do it," she said again.
 
She let him go and stood back.
 
"I want you to do something for me," she said,  and  unexpectedly
laughed.
 
"I want," she said, and laughed again. She put her hand over  her
mouth  and then said with a straight face, "I want you to take me
to your leader," and she pointed into the War Zones in  the  sky.
She seemed somehow to know that their leader would be there.
 
Her laughter seemed to discharge  something  in  the  atmosphere.
From somewhere at the back of the crowd a single voice started to
sing a tune which would  have  enabled  Paul  McCartney,  had  he
written it, to buy the world.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 30
 
Zaphod Beeblebrox crawled bravely along a tunnel, like  the  hell
of  a  guy  he  was. He was very confused, but continued crawling
doggedly anyway because he was that brave.
 
He was confused by something he had just seen, but  not  half  as
confused as he was going to be by something he was about to hear,
so it would now be best to explain exactly where he was.
 
He was in the Robot War Zones many miles above the surface of the
planet Krikkit.
 
The atmosphere was thin here and relatively unprotected from  any
rays or anything which space might care to hurl in his direction.
 
He had parked  the  starship  Heart  of  Gold  amongst  the  huge
jostling  dim  hulks that crowded the sky here above Krikkit, and
had entered what appeared to be the biggest and most important of
the sky buildings, armed with nothing but a Zap gun and something
for his headaches.
 
He had found himself in a long, wide and badly  lit  corridor  in
which  he  was able to hide until he worked out what he was going
to do next. He hid because every now and then one of the  Krikkit
robots  would  walk along it, and although he had so far led some
kind of charmed life at their hands, it had nevertheless been  an
extremely  painful  one,  and he had no desire to stretch what he
was only half-inclined to call his good fortune.
 
He  had  ducked, at one  point,  into  a  room  leading  off  the
corridor,  and  had  discovered it to be a huge and, again, dimly
lit chamber.
 
In fact, it was a museum with just one exhibit - the wreckage  of
a spacecraft. It was terribly burnt and mangled, and, now that he
had caught up with some of the Galactic  history  he  had  missed
through  his  failed  attempts  to  have sex with the girl in the
cybercubicle next to him at school, he was  able  to  put  in  an
intelligent  guess  that this was the wrecked spaceship which had
drifted through the Dust Cloud all those billions  of  years  ago
and started the whole business off.
 
But, and  this  is  where  he  had  become  confused,  there  was
something not at all right about it.
 
It was genuinely wrecked. It was genuinely burnt,  but  a  fairly
brief inspection by an experienced eye revealed that it was not a
genuine spacecraft. It was as if it was a full-scale model of one
- a solid blueprint. In other words it was a very useful thing to
have around if you suddenly decided to build a spaceship yourself
and  didn't know how to do it. It was not, however, anything that
would ever fly anywhere itself.
 
He was still puzzling over this - in fact he'd only just  started
to  puzzle  over  it  - when he became aware that a door had slid
open in another part  of  the  chamber,  and  another  couple  of
Krikkit robots had entered, looking a little glum.
 
Zaphod did not want to tangle with them and, deciding  that  just
as  discretion was the better part of valour so was cowardice the
better  part  of  discretion,  he  valiantly  hid  himself  in  a
cupboard.
 
The cupboard in fact turned out to be the top  part  of  a  shaft
which   led   down  through  an  inspection  hatch  into  a  wide
ventilation tunnel. He led himself down into it  and  started  to
crawl along it, which is where we found him.
 
He  didn't  like  it.  It   was   cold,   dark   and   profoundly
uncomfortable,  and it frightened him. At the first opportunity -
which was another shaft  a  hundred  yards  further  along  -  he
climbed back up out of it.
 
This time he emerged into a smaller chamber, which appeared to be
a computer intelligence centre. He emerged in a dark narrow space
between a large computer bank and the wall.
 
He quickly learned that he was  not  alone  in  the  chamber  and
started  to leave again, when he began to listen with interest to
what the other occupants were saying.
 
"It's the robots, sir," said one voice. "There's something  wrong
with them."
 
"What, exactly?"
 
These were the voices of two War Command Krikkiters. All the  War
Commanders  lived  up in the sky in the Robot War Zones, and were
largely immune to the whimsical doubts  and  uncertainties  which
were afflicting their fellows down on the surface of the planet.
 
"Well, sir I think it's just as well that they are  being  phased
out  of the war effort, and that we are now going to detonate the
supernova bomb. In the very short time  since  we  were  released
from the envelope -"
 
"Get to the point."
 
"The robots aren't enjoying it, sir."
 
"What?"
 
"The war, sir, it seems  to  be  getting  them  down.  There's  a
certain  world-weariness  about  them,  or  perhaps  I should say
Universe-weariness."
 
"Well, that's all right, they're meant to be helping  to  destroy
it."
 
"Yes, well they're finding it difficult, sir. They are  afflicted
with  a  certain  lassitude.  They're just finding it hard to get
behind the job. They lack oomph."
 
"What are you trying to say?"
 
"Well, I think they're very depressed about something, sir."
 
"What on Krikkit are you talking about?"
 
"Well, in the few skirmishes they've had recently, it seems  that
they  go  into  battle,  raise their weapons to fire and suddenly
think, why bother? What, cosmically speaking, is  it  all  about?
And they just seem to get a little tired and a little grim."
 
"And then what do they do?"
 
"Er, quadratic equations mostly, sir. Fiendishly  difficult  ones
by all accounts. And then they sulk."
 
"Sulk?"
 
"Yes, sir."
 
"Whoever heard of a robot sulking?"
 
"I don't know, sir."
 
"What was that noise?"
 
It was the noise of Zaphod leaving with his head spinning.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 31
 
In a deep well of darkness a crippled  robot  sat.  It  had  been
silent  in  its  metallic darkness for some time. It was cold and
damp, but being a robot it was supposed not to be able to  notice
these  things.  With  an enormous effort of will, however, it did
manage to notice them.
 
Its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core  of
the  Krikkit War Computer. It wasn't enjoying the experience, and
neither was the central intelligence  core  of  the  Krikkit  War
Computer.
 
The  Krikkit  robots  which  had  salvaged  this  pathetic  metal
creature  from  the  swamps of Squornshellous Zeta had recognized
almost immediately its gigantic intelligence, and the  use  which
this could be to them.
 
They hadn't reckoned with the  attendant  personality  disorders,
which  the  coldness, the darkness, the dampness, the crampedness
and the loneliness were doing nothing to decrease.
 
It was not happy with its task.
 
Apart from anything else, the  mere  coordination  of  an  entire
planet's  military strategy was taking up only a tiny part of its
formidable mind, and the rest of it had become  extremely  bored.
Having  solved  all  the  major mathematical, physical, chemical,
biological,    sociological,     philosophical,     etymological,
meteorological  and psychological problems of the Universe except
his own, three times over, he was severely stuck for something to
do, and had taken up composing short dolorous ditties of no tone,
or indeed tune. The latest one was a lullaby.
 
"Now the world has gone to bed," Marvin droned,
 
"Darkness won't engulf my head,
 
"I can see by infra-red,
 
"How I hate the night."
 
He paused to gather the artistic and emotional strength to tackle
the next verse.
 
"Now I lay me down to sleep,
 
"Try to count electric sheep,
 
"Sweet dream wishes you can keep,
 
"How I hate the night."
 
"Marvin!" hissed a voice.
 
His head snapped up, almost dislodging the intricate  network  of
electrodes  which  connected  him  to  the  central  Krikkit  War
Computer.
 
An inspection hatch had opened and one of a pair of unruly  heads
was  peering  through  whilst  the  other  kept  on jogging it by
continually  darting  to  look  this  way  and   that   extremely
nervously.
 
"Oh, it's you," muttered the robot. "I might have known."
 
"Hey, kid," said Zaphod in astonishment, "was  that  you  singing
just then?"
 
"I  am,"   Marvin   acknowledged   bitterly,   "in   particularly
scintillating form at the moment."
 
Zaphod poked his head in through the hatchway and looked around.
 
"Are you alone?" he said.
 
"Yes," said Marvin. "Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my  only
companions. And vast intelligence of course. And infinite sorrow.
And ..."
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod. "Hey, what's your connection with all this?"
 
"This," said Marvin, indicating with his less damaged arm all the
electrodes which connected him with the Krikkit computer.
 
"Then," said Zaphod awkwardly, "I guess you must  have  saved  my
life. Twice."
 
"Three times," said Marvin.
 
Zaphod's head snapped round (his other one was looking  hawkishly
in  entirely  the wrong direction) just in time to see the lethal
killer robot directly behind him seize up and start to smoke.  It
staggered  backwards and slumped against a wall. It slid down it.
It slipped sideways, threw its  head  back  and  started  to  sob
inconsolably.
 
Zaphod looked back at Marvin.
 
"You must have a terrific outlook on life," he said.
 
"Just don't even ask," said Marvin.
 
"I won't," said Zaphod, and didn't. "Hey look," he added, "you're
doing a terrific job."
 
"Which means, I suppose," said Marvin,  requiring  only  one  ten
thousand  million  billion trillion grillionth part of his mental
powers to make this particular logical  leap,  "that  you're  not
going to release me or anything like that."
 
"Kid, you know I'd love to."
 
"But you're not going to."
 
"No."
 
"I see."
 
"You're working well."
 
"Yes," said Marvin. "Why stop now just when I'm hating it?"
 
"I got to find Trillian and the guys. Hey,  you  any  idea  where
they  are? I mean, I just got a planet to choose from. Could take
a while."
 
"They are very close," said Marvin dolefully.  "You  can  monitor
them from here if you like."
 
"I better go get them," asserted Zaphod.  "Er,  maybe  they  need
some help, right?"
 
"Maybe," said Marvin with unexpected authority in his  lugubrious
voice,  "it would be better if you monitored them from here. That
young  girl,"  he  added  unexpectedly,  "is  one  of  the  least
benightedly unintelligent life forms it has been my profound lack
of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting."
 
Zaphod took a  moment  or  two  to  find  his  way  through  this
labyrinthine  string  of  negatives  and emerged at the other end
with surprise.
 
"Trillian?"  he  said.  "She's  just  a  kid.  Cute,  yeah,   but
temperamental.  You  know  how  it  is with women. Or perhaps you
don't. I assume you don't. If you do I don't want to  hear  about
it. Plug us in."
 
"... totally manipulated."
 
"What?" said Zaphod.
 
It was Trillian speaking. He turned round.
 
The wall against which the Krikkit robot was sobbing had  lit  up
to  reveal a scene taking place in some other unknown part of the
Krikkit Robot War zones. It seemed to be  a  council  chamber  of
some  kind  -  Zaphod couldn't make it out too clearly because of
the robot slumped against the screen.
 
He tried to move the robot, but it was heavy with its  grief  and
tried to bite him, so he just looked around as best he could.
 
"Just think about it," said Trillian's voice,  "your  history  is
just  a  series  of  freakishly  improbable events. And I know an
improbable event when I see one. Your complete isolation from the
Galaxy  was freakish for a start. Right out on the very edge with
a Dust Cloud around you. It's a set-up. Obviously."
 
Zaphod was mad with  frustration  because  he  couldn't  see  the
screen.  The  robot's  head  was obscuring his view of the people
Trillian as  talking  to,  his  multi-functional  battleclub  was
obscuring the background, and the elbow of the arm it had pressed
tragically against its brow was obscuring Trillian herself.
 
"Then," said Trillian, "this spaceship that crash-landed on  your
planet. That's really likely, isn't it? Have you any idea of what
the  odds  are  against   a   drifting   spaceship   accidentally
intersecting with the orbit of a planet?"
 
"Hey," said Zaphod, "she doesn't know what the zark she's talking
about. I've seen that spaceship. It's a fake. No deal."
 
"I thought it might be,"  said  Marvin  from  his  prison  behind
Zaphod.
 
"Oh yeah," said Zaphod. "It's easy for you to say  that.  I  just
told you. Anyway, I don't see what it's got to do with anything."
 
"And  especially,"  continued  Trillian,  "the  odds  against  it
intersecting  with  the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy, or
the whole of the Universe as far as I know, that would be totally
traumatized  to  see it. You don't know what the odds are? Nor do
I, they're  that  big.  Again,  it's  a  set-up.  I  wouldn't  be
surprised if that spaceship was just a fake."
 
Zaphod managed to move the robot's battleclub. Behind it  on  the
screen  were  the  figures of Ford, Arthur and Slartibartfast who
appeared astonished and bewildered by the whole thing.
 
"Hey, look," said Zaphod excitedly. "The guys are doing great. Ra
ra ra! Go get 'em, guys."
 
"And  what  about,"  said  Trillian,  "all  this  technology  you
suddenly  managed  to build for yourselves almost overnight? Most
people would take thousands of years to do all that. Someone  was
feeding  you  what you needed to know, someone was keeping you at
it.
 
"I  know,  I  know,"  she  added  in  response   to   an   unseen
interruption, "I know you didn't realize it was going on. This is
exactly my point. You never realized anything at all.  Like  this
Supernova Bomb."
 
"How do you know about that?" said an unseen voice.
 
"I just know," said Trillian. "You expect me to believe that  you
are  bright  enough to invent something that brilliant and be too
dumb to realize it would take you with it  as  well?  That's  not
just stupid, that is spectacularly obtuse."
 
"Hey, what's this bomb thing?" said Zaphod in alarm to Marvin.
 
"The supernova bomb?" said  Marvin.  "It's  a  very,  very  small
bomb."
 
"Yeah?"
 
"That would destroy the Universe in toto,"  added  Marvin.  "Good
idea, if you ask me. They won't get it to work, though."
 
"Why not, if it's so brilliant?"
 
"It's brilliant," said Marvin, "they're not. They got as  far  as
designing  it  before  they  were locked in the envelope. They've
spent the last five years building it. They think they've got  it
right  but  they  haven't. They're as stupid as any other organic
life form. I hate them."
 
Trillian was continuing.
 
Zaphod tried to pull the Krikkit robot away by its  leg,  but  it
kicked  and growled at him, and then quaked with a fresh outburst
of sobbing. Then  suddenly  it  slumped  over  and  continued  to
express its feelings out of everybody's way on the floor.
 
Trillian was standing alone in the middle of  the  chamber  tired
out but with fiercely burning eyes.
 
Ranged in front of her were the  pale-faced  and  wrinkled  Elder
Masters of Krikkit, motionless behind their widely curved control
desk, staring at her with helpless fear and hatred.
 
In front of them, equidistant between their control desk and  the
middle  of the chamber, where Trillian stood, as if on trial, was
a slim white pillar about four feet tall. On top of  it  stood  a
small white globe, about three, maybe four inches in diameter.
 
Beside  it  stood  a  Krikkit  robot  with  its  multi-functional
battleclub.
 
"In fact," explained Trillian, "you are so dumb stupid" (She  was
sweating. Zaphod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her
to be doing at this point) "you are all so  dumb  stupid  that  I
doubt, I very much doubt, that you've been able to build the bomb
properly without any help from Hactar for the last five years."
 
"Who's this guy Hactar?" said Zaphod, squaring his shoulders.
 
If Marvin replied, Zaphod didn't hear him. All his attention  was
concentrated on the screen.
 
One of the Elders of Krikkit made a small motion  with  his  hand
towards the Krikkit robot. The robot raised his club.
 
"There's nothing I can do," said Marvin. "It's on an  independent
circuit from the others."
 
"Wait," said Trillian.
 
The Elder  made  a  small  motion.  The  robot  halted.  Trillian
suddenly seemed very doubtful of her own judgment.
 
"How do you know all this?" said Zaphod to Marvin at this point.
 
"Computer records," said Marvin. "I have access."
 
"You're very different, aren't you," said Trillian to  the  Elder
Masters,  "from your fellow worldlings down on the ground. You've
spent all your lives up  here,  unprotected  by  the  atmosphere.
You've  been  very  vulnerable.  The  rest  of  your race is very
frightened, you know, they don't want you to do this. You're  out
of touch, why don't you check up?"
 
The Krikkit Elder grew impatient. He made a gesture to the  robot
which  was precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made
to it.
 
The robot swung its battleclub. It hit the small white globe.
 
The small white globe was the supernova bomb.
 
It was a very, very small bomb which was designed  to  bring  the
entire Universe to an end.
 
The supernova bomb flew through the air. It hit the back wall  of
the council chamber and dented it very badly.
 
"So how does she know all this?" said Zaphod.
 
Marvin kept a sullen silence.
 
"Probably just bluffing," said Zaphod. "Poor kid, I should  never
have left her alone."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 32
 
"Hactar!" called Trillian. "What are you up to?"
 
There was no reply from the enclosing darkness. Trillian  waited,
nervously.  She  was  sure that she couldn't be wrong. She peered
into the gloom from which she had been  expecting  some  kind  of
response. But there was only cold silence.
 
"Hactar?" she called again. "I would like you to meet  my  friend
Arthur  Dent.  I  wanted  to  go  off  with a Thunder God, but he
wouldn't let me and I appreciate that. He made me  realize  where
my  affections really lay. Unfortunately Zaphod is too frightened
by all this, so I brought Arthur instead. I'm not  sure  why  I'm
telling you all this.
 
"Hello?" she said again. "Hactar?"
 
And then it came.
 
It was thin and feeble, like a voice carried on the wind  from  a
great distance, half heard, a memory of a dream of a voice.
 
"Won't you both come out," said the voice. "I  promise  that  you
will be perfectly safe."
 
They glanced at each other, and  then  stepped  out,  improbably,
along  the shaft of light which streamed out of the open hatchway
of the Heart of Gold into the dim granular darkness of  the  Dust
Cloud.
 
Arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her, but she
wouldn't let him. He held on to his airline hold-all with its tin
of Greek  olive  oil,  its  towel,  its  crumpled  postcards   of
Santorini  and its other odds and ends. He steadied and reassured
that instead.
 
They were standing on, and in, nothing.
 
Murky, dusty nothing.  Each  grain  of  dust  of  the  pulverized
computer sparkled dimly as it turned and twisted slowly, catching
the sunlight in the darkness. Each particle of the computer, each
speck  of  dust,  held  within  itself,  faintly  and weakly, the
pattern of the whole.  In  reducing  the  computer  to  dust  the
Silastic   Armorfiends  of  Striterax  had  merely  crippled  the
computer, not killed it. A weak and insubstantial field held  the
particles in slight relationships with each other.
 
Arthur and Trillian stood, or rather floated, in  the  middle  of
this  bizarre  entity.  They  had nothing to breathe, but for the
moment this seemed not to matter. Hactar kept his  promise.  They
were safe. For the moment.
 
"I have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality," said  Hactar
faintly,  "but  tricks  of  the  light.  It  is  possible  to  be
comfortable with tricks of the light, though, if that is all  you
have."
 
His voice evanesced, and in the dark dust a long velvet  paisley-
covered sofa coalesced into hazy shape.
 
Arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa which
had appeared to him in the fields of prehistoric Earth. He wanted
to shout and shake with rage that the Universe kept  doing  these
insanely bewildering things to him.
 
He let  this  feeling  subside,  and  then  sat  on  the  sofa  -
carefully. Trillian sat on it too.
 
It was real.
 
At least, if it wasn't real, it did support them, and as that  is
what  sofas  are supposed to do, this, by any test that mattered,
was a real sofa.
 
The voice on the solar wind breathed to them again.
 
"I hope you are comfortable," it said.
 
They nodded.
 
"And I would like to congratulate you on  the  accuracy  of  your
deductions."
 
Arthur quickly pointed out that he hadn't deduced  anything  much
himself,  Trillian  was  the  one. She had simply asked him along
because he was interested in life, the Universe, and everything.
 
"That is something  in  which  I  too  am  interested,"  breathed
Hactar.
 
"Well," said Arthur, "we should have a chat  about  it  sometime.
Over a cup of tea."
 
There slowly materialized in front of them a small  wooden  table
on which sat a silver teapot, a bone china milk jug, a bone china
sugar bowl, and two bone china cups and saucers.
 
Arthur reached forward, but they were just a trick of the  light.
He  leaned  back  on the sofa, which was an illusion his body was
prepared to accept as comfortable.
 
"Why," said Trillian, "do  you  feel  you  have  to  destroy  the
Universe?"
 
She found it a little difficult talking  into  nothingness,  with
nothing  on  which  to  focus.  Hactar obviously noticed this. He
chuckled a ghostly chuckle.
 
"If it's going to be that sort of session," he said, "we  may  as
well have the right sort of setting."
 
And now there materialized in front of them something new. It was
the  dim  hazy  image  of  a  couch - a psychiatrist's couch. The
leather with which it was upholstered was  shiny  and  sumptuous,
but again, it was only a trick of the light.
 
Around them, to complete the setting, was the hazy suggestion  of
wood-panelled  walls.  And then, on the couch, appeared the image
of Hactar himself, and it was an eye-twisting image.
 
The couch looked normal size for a psychiatrist's couch  -  about
five or six feet long.
 
The computer looked normal size for a black space-borne  computer
satellite - about a thousand miles across.
 
The illusion that the one was sitting on top of the other was the
thing which made the eyes twist.
 
"All right," said Trillian firmly. She stood up off the sofa. She
felt  that  she  was  being  asked to feel too comfortable and to
accept too many illusions.
 
"Very good," she said. "Can you construct real things too? I mean
solid objects?"
 
Again there was a pause before the answer, as if  the  pulverized
mind  of Hactar had to collect its thoughts from the millions and
millions of miles over which it was scattered.
 
"Ah," he sighed. "You are thinking of the spaceship."
 
Thoughts seemed to drift by them and  through  them,  like  waves
through the ether.
 
"Yes," he acknowledge, "I can.
 
"But it takes enormous effort and time. All I can do  in  my  ...
particle  state, you see, is encourage and suggest. Encourage and
suggest. And suggest ..."
 
The image of Hactar on the couch seemed to billow and  waver,  as
if finding it hard to maintain itself.
 
It gathered new strength.
 
"I can encourage and suggest," it said,  "tiny  pieces  of  space
debris  -  the  odd  minute  meteor,  a few molecules here, a few
hydrogen atoms  there  -  to  move  together.  I  encourage  them
together. I can tease them into shape, but it takes many aeons."
 
"So, did you make," asked  Trillian  again,  "the  model  of  the
wrecked spacecraft?"
 
"Er ... yes," murmured Hactar. "I have made ... a few  things.  I
can  move  them  about.  I made the spacecraft. It seemed best to
do."
 
Something then made Arthur pick up his hold-all from where he had
left it on the sofa and grasp it tightly.
 
The mist of Hactar's ancient shattered mind swirled about them as
if uneasy dreams were moving through it.
 
"I repented, you see," he  murmured  dolefully.  "I  repented  of
sabotaging my own design for the Silastic Armorfiends. It was not
my place to make such decisions.  I  was  created  to  fulfill  a
function and I failed in it. I negated my own existence."
 
Hactar sighed, and they waited in silence for him to continue his
story.
 
"You were right," he said at length. "I deliberately nurtured the
planet  of  Krikkit  till  they would arrive at the same state of
mind as the Silastic Armorfiends, and require of me the design of
the bomb I failed to make the first time. I wrapped myself around
the planet and coddled it. Under the influence of  events  I  was
able  to  generate,  they  learned to hate like maniacs. I had to
make them live in the sky. On the ground my influences  were  too
weak.
 
"Without me, of course, when they were locked away from me in the
envelope  of  Slo-Time,  their responses became very confused and
they were unable to manage.
 
"Ah well, ah well," he added, "I was only trying  to  fulfill  my
function."
 
And very gradually, very, very slowly, the images  in  the  cloud
began to fade, gently to melt away.
 
And then, suddenly, they stopped fading.
 
"There was also the matter of revenge, of course,"  said  Hactar,
with a sharpness which was new in his voice.
 
"Remember," he said, "that I was pulverized, and then left  in  a
crippled  and  semi-impotent  state  for  billions  of  years.  I
honestly would rather wipe out the Universe. You would  feel  the
same way, believe me."
 
He paused again, as eddies swept through the Dust.
 
"But primarily," he said in his  former,  wistful  tone,  "I  was
trying to fulfill my function. Ah well."
 
Trillian said, "Does it worry you that you have failed?"
 
"Have I failed?" whispered Hactar. The image of the  computer  on
the psychiatrist's couch began slowly to fade again.
 
"Ah well, ah well," the fading voice intoned again. "No,  failure
doesn't bother me now."
 
"You know what we have to do?" said Trillian, her voice cold  and
businesslike.
 
"Yes," said Hactar, "you're going to disperse me. You  are  going
to destroy my consciousness. Please be my guest - after all these
aeons, oblivion is all I crave. If I haven't already fulfilled my
function, then it's too late now. Thank you and good night."
 
The sofa vanished.
 
The tea table vanished.
 
The couch and the computer vanished. the walls were gone.  Arthur
and Trillian made their curious way back into the Heart of Gold.
 
"Well, that," said Arthur, "would appear to be that."
 
The flames danced higher in front of him and then subsided. A few
last  licks  and  they were gone, leaving him with just a pile of
Ashes, where a few minutes previously there had been  the  Wooden
Pillar of Nature and Spirituality.
 
He  scooped  them  off  the hob of  the  Heart  of  Gold's  Gamma
barbecue,  put  them  in  a  paper  bag, and walked back into the
bridge.
 
"I think we should take them back," he said. "I  feel  that  very
strongly."
 
He had already  had  an  argument  with  Slartibartfast  on  this
matter,  and  eventually the old man had got annoyed and left. he
had returned to his own ship the Bistromath, had  a  furious  row
with  the  waiter and disappeared off into an entirely subjective
idea of what space was.
 
The argument had arisen because Arthur's idea  of  returning  the
Ashes  to Lord's Cricket Ground at the same moment that they were
originally taken would involve travelling back in time a  day  or
so,   and   this   was  precisely  the  sort  of  gratuitous  and
irresponsible mucking about that the Campaign for Real  Time  was
trying to put a stop to.
 
"Yes," Arthur had said, "but you try  and  explain  that  to  the
MCC," and he would hear no more against the idea.
 
"I think," he said again, and stopped. The reason he  started  to
say  it  again  was  because no one had listened to him the first
time, and the reason he stopped  was  because  it  looked  fairly
clear that no one was going to listen to him this time either.
 
Ford, Zaphod and Trillian were watching the visiscreens  intently
as  Hactar  was  dispersing under pressure from a vibration field
which the Heart of Gold was pumping into it.
 
"What did it say?" asked Ford.
 
"I thought I heard it say," said  Trillian  in  a  puzzle  voice,
"`What's done is done ... I have fulfilled my function ...'"
 
"I think we should take these back," said Arthur holding  up  the
bag containing the Ashes. "I feel that very strongly."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 33
 
The sun was shining calmly on a scene of complete havoc.
 
Smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the  wake  of
the  theft of the Ashes by the Krikkit robots. Through the smoke,
people were running panicstricken,  colliding  with  each  other,
tripping over stretchers, being arrested.
 
One policeman was attempting to arrest Wowbagger  the  Infinitely
Prolonged  for insulting behaviour, but was unable to prevent the
tall grey-green alien from returning to his ship  and  arrogantly
flying away, thus causing even more panic and pandemonium.
 
In the middle of this, for the second time  that  afternoon,  the
figures  of  Arthur  Dent and Ford Prefect suddenly materialized,
they had teleported down out of the Heart of Gold which  was  now
in parking orbit round the planet.
 
"I can explain," shouted Arthur. "I have the  Ashes!  They're  in
this bag."
 
"I don't think you have their attention," said Ford.
 
"I have also helped save the Universe," called Arthur  to  anyone
who was prepared to listen, in other words no one.
 
"That should have been a crowd-stopper," said Arthur to Ford.
 
"It wasn't," said Ford.
 
Arthur accosted a policeman who was running past.
 
"Excuse me," he said. "The Ashes. I've got them. They were stolen
by  those  white  robots a moment ago. I've got them in this bag.
They were part of the Key to the Slo-Time envelope, you see, and,
well,  anyway  you can guess the rest, the point is I've got them
and what should I do with them?"
 
The policeman told him, but Arthur could only assume that he  was
speaking metaphorically.
 
He wandered about disconsolately.
 
"Is no one interested?" he shouted out. A man rushed past him and
jogged  his  elbow,  he  dropped  the  paper bag and it spilt its
contents all over the ground. Arthur stared down  at  it  with  a
tight-set mouth.
 
Ford looked at him.
 
"Wanna go now?" he said.
 
Arthur heaved a heavy sigh. He looked around at the planet Earth,
for what he was now certain would be the last time.
 
"OK," he said.
 
At that moment, through the clearing smoke, he  caught  sight  of
one of the wickets, still standing in spite of everything.
 
"Hold on a moment," he said to Ford. "When I was a boy ..."
 
"Can you tell me later?"
 
"I had a passion for cricket, you know, but I wasn't very good at
it."
 
"Or not at all, if you prefer."
 
"And I always dreamed, rather stupidly, that one day I would bowl
at Lord's."
 
He looked around him at the  panicstricken  throng.  No  one  was
going to mind very much.
 
"OK," said Ford wearily. "Get it  over  with.  I  shall  be  over
there,"  he added, "being bored." He went and sat down on a patch
of smoking grass.
 
Arthur remembered that on their first visit there that afternoon,
the  cricket  ball  had actually landed in his bag, and he looked
through the bag.
 
He  had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it
wasn't  the  same bag that he'd had at the time. Still, there the
ball was amongst his souvenirs of Greece.
 
He took it out and polished it against his hip, spat  on  it  and
polished  it  again. He put the bag down. He was going to do this
properly.
 
He tossed the small hard red ball from hand to hand, feeling  its
weight.
 
With a wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern,  he  trotted
off  away  from  the  wicket. A medium-fast pace, he decided, and
measured a good long run-up.
 
He looked up into the sky. The birds were wheeling  about  it,  a
few  white  clouds  scudded across it. The air was disturbed with
the sounds of police and ambulance sirens, and  people  screaming
and yelling, but he felt curiously happy and untouched by it all.
He was going to bowl a ball at Lord's.
 
He turned and pawed a couple of times  at  the  ground  with  his
bedroom  slippers.  He  squared his shoulders, tossed the ball in
the air and caught it again.
 
He started to run.
 
As he ran, he saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman.
 
Oh, good, he thought, that should add a little ...
 
Then, as his running feet took him nearer, he saw  more  clearly.
The  batsman  standing  ready  at  the  wicket was not one of the
England cricket team. He was not one of  the  Australian  cricket
team.  It was one of the robot Krikkit team. It was a cold, hard,
lethal white killer-robot that presumably had not returned to its
ship with the others.
 
Quite a few thoughts  collided  in  Arthur  Dent's  mind  at  tis
moment,  but  he  didn't  seem  to  be able to stop running. Time
seemed to be going terribly, terribly slowly, but still he didn't
seem to be able to stop running.
 
Moving as if through syrup, he slowly turned  his  troubled  head
and  looked at his own hand, the hand which was holding the small
hard red ball.
 
His feet were pounding slowly onwards, unstoppably, as he  stared
at  the ball gripped in his helpless hand. It was emitting a deep
red glow and flashing intermittently. And  still  his  feet  were
pounding inexorably forward.
 
He looked at the Krikkit robot again  standing  implacably  still
and purposefully in front of him, battleclub raised in readiness.
Its eyes were burning with a deep  cold  fascinating  light,  and
Arthur  could  not  move  his own eyes from them. He seemed to be
looking down a tunnel at them - nothing on either side seemed  to
exist.
 
Some of the thoughts which were colliding in  his  mind  at  this
time were these:
 
He felt a hell of a fool.
 
He felt that he should have listened rather more carefully  to  a
number  of  things  he  had heard said, phrases which now pounded
round in his mind as his feet pounded onwards to the point  where
he  would  inevitably  release the ball to the Krikkit robot, who
would inevitably strike it.
 
He remembered Hactar saying,  "Have  I  failed?  Failure  doesn't
bother me."
 
He remembered the account of Hactar's dying words,  "What's  done
is done, I have fulfilled my function."
 
He remembered Hactar saying that he had managed to  make  "a  few
things."
 
He remembered the sudden movement in his hold-all that  had  made
him grip it tightly to himself when he was in the Dust Cloud.
 
He remembered that he had travelled back in time a couple of days
to come to Lord's again.
 
He also remembered that he wasn't a very good bowler.
 
He felt his arm coming round, gripping tightly  on  to  the  ball
which  he now knew for certain was the supernova bomb that Hactar
had built himself and planted on him, the bomb which would  cause
the Universe to come to an abrupt and premature end.
 
He hoped and prayed that  there  wasn't  an  afterlife.  Then  he
realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped
that there wasn't an afterlife.
 
He would feel very, very embarrassed meeting everybody.
 
He hoped, he hoped, he hoped that his bowling was as  bad  as  he
remembered it to be, because that seemed to be the only thing now
standing between this moment and universal oblivion.
 
He felt his legs pounding, he felt his arm coming round, he  felt
his  feet connecting with the airline hold-all he'd stupidly left
lying on the ground in front of  him,  he  felt  himself  falling
heavily  forward  but,  having his mind so terribly full of other
things at this moment, he completely  forgot  about  hitting  the
ground and didn't.
 
Still holding the ball firmly in his right hand he soared up into
the air whimpering with surprise.
 
He wheeled and whirled through the air, spinning out of control.
 
He twisted down towards the ground, flinging  himself  hectically
through the air, at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off
into the distance.
 
He hurtled towards the astounded robot from behind. It still  had
its  multi-functional  battleclub  raised,  but had suddenly been
deprived of anything to hit.
 
With a sudden mad access of strength, he wrestled the  battleclub
from  the grip of the startled robot, executed a dazzling banking
turn in the air, hurtled back down in a furious  power-drive  and
with  one  crazy  swing knocked the robot's head from the robot's
shoulders.
 
"Are you coming now?" said Ford.
 
=================================================================
Epilogue:
 
Life, the Universe and Everything
 
And at the end they travelled again.
 
There was a time when Arthur Dent would not.  He  said  that  the
Bistromathic  Drive  had  revealed  to him that time and distance
were one, that mind and Universe were one,  that  perception  and
reality  were  one,  and that the more one travelled the more one
stayed in one place, and that what with one thing and another  he
would rather just stay put for a while and sort it all out in his
mind, which was now at one with the Universe so it shouldn't take
too  long,  and  he  could  get  a good rest afterwards, put in a
little flying practice and learn to  cook  which  he  had  always
meant  to  do. The can of Greek olive oil was now his most prized
possession, and he said that the way it had  unexpectedly  turned
up in his life had again given him a certain sense of the oneness
of things which made him feel that ...
 
He yawned and fell asleep.
 
In the morning as they prepared to take him  to  some  quiet  and
idyllic  planet  where  they  wouldn't mind him talking like that
they suddenly picked  up  a  computer-driven  distress  call  and
diverted to investigate.
 
A small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the  Merida  class
seemed  to  be  dancing  a strange little jig through the void. A
brief computer scan revealed that the ship was fine, its computer
was fine, but that its pilot was mad.
 
"Half-mad, half-mad," the  man  insisted  as  they  carried  him,
raving, aboard.
 
He was a journalist  with  the  Siderial  Daily  Mentioner.  They
sedated  him  and  sent  Marvin  in  to keep him company until he
promised to try and talk sense.
 
"I was covering a trial," he said at last, "on Argabuthon."
 
He pushed himself up on to his thin wasted  shoulders,  his  eyes
stared  wildly.  His white hair seemed to be waving at someone it
knew in the next room.
 
"Easy, easy," said Ford. Trillian put  a  soothing  hand  on  his
shoulder.
 
The man sank back down again and stared at  the  ceiling  of  the
ship's sick bay.
 
"The case," he said, "is now immaterial, but there was a  witness
...  a  witness  ...  a man called ... called Prak. A strange and
difficult man. They were eventually forced to administer  a  drug
to make him tell the truth, a truth drug."
 
His eyes rolled helplessly in his head.
 
"They gave him too much," he said in a tiny whimper.  "They  gave
him  much  too much." He started to cry. "I thing the robots must
have jogged the surgeon's arm."
 
"Robots?" said Zaphod sharply. "What robots?"
 
"Some white robots," whispered the man hoarsely, "broke into  the
courtroom  and  stole the judge's sceptre, the Argabuthon Sceptre
of Justice, nasty Perspex thing. I don't  know  why  they  wanted
it."  He  began  to  cry  again.  "And  I  think  they jogged the
surgeon's arm ..."
 
He shook his head loosely from side to side,  helplessly,  sadly,
his eyes screwed up in pain.
 
"And when the trial continued," he said  in  a  weeping  whisper,
"they  asked  Prak  a most unfortunate thing. They asked him," he
paused and shivered, "to tell the  Truth,  the  Whole  Truth  and
Nothing but the Truth. Only, don't you see?"
 
He suddenly hoisted himself up on to his elbows again and shouted
at them.
 
"They'd given him much too much of the drug!"
 
He collapsed again, moaning quietly. "Much too much too much  too
much too ..."
 
The group gathered round his bedside glanced at each other. there
were goose pimples on backs.
 
"What happened?" said Zaphod at last.
 
"Oh, he told it all right," said the man  savagely,  "for  all  I
know  he's  still  telling  it  now. Strange, terrible things ...
terrible, terrible!" he screamed.
 
They tried to calm him, but he struggled to his elbows again.
 
"Terrible things, incomprehensible things," he  shouted,  "things
that would drive a man mad!"
 
He stared wildly at them.
 
"Or in my case," he said, "half-mad. I'm a journalist."
 
"You  mean,"  said  Arthur  quietly,  "that  you  are   used   to
confronting the truth?"
 
"No," said the man with a puzzled frown. "I mean that I  made  an
excuse and left early."
 
He collapsed into a coma from which he recovered  only  once  and
briefly.
 
On that one occasion, they discovered from him the following:
 
When it became clear that Prak could not be  stopped,  that  here
was truth in its absolute and final form, the court was cleared.
 
Not only cleared, it was sealed up, with Prak still in it.  Steel
walls  were  erected around it, and, just to be on the safe side,
barbed wire, electric fences, crocodile swamps  and  three  major
armies  were  installed,  so  that no one would ever have to hear
Prak speak.
 
"That's a pity," said Arthur. "I'd like to hear what  he  had  to
say.  Presumably  he would know what the Ultimate Question to the
Ultimate Answer is. It's always bothered me that we  never  found
out."
 
"Think of a number," said the computer, " any number."
 
Arthur told the computer the telephone  number  of  King's  Cross
railway  station passenger inquiries, on the grounds that it must
have some function, and this might turn out to be it.
 
The computer injected the number into  the  ship's  reconstituted
Improbability Drive.
 
In Relativity, Matter tells Space how to curve, and  Space  tells
Matter how to move.
 
The Heart of Gold told space to get knotted,  and  parked  itself
neatly within the inner steel perimeter of the Argabuthon Chamber
of Law.
 
The courtroom was an austere place, a large dark chamber, clearly
designed for Justice rather than, for instance, for Pleasure. You
wouldn't hold a dinner party here - at least,  not  a  successful
one. The decor would get your guests down.
 
The ceilings were high, vaulted and  very  dark.  Shadows  lurked
there  with  grim  determination. The panelling for the walls and
benches, the cladding of the heavy pillars, all were carved  from
the  darkest  and  most  severe  trees  in the fearsome Forest of
Arglebard. The massive black Podium of  Justice  which  dominated
the  centre of the chamber was a monster of gravity. If a sunbeam
had ever managed to slink this far into the  Justice  complex  of
Argabuthon  it  would  have turned around and slunk straight back
out again.
 
Arthur and Trillian were the first in,  whilst  Ford  and  Zaphod
bravely kept a watch on their rear.
 
At first it seemed totally dark  and  deserted.  their  footsteps
echoed  hollowly  round the chamber. This seemed curious. All the
defences were still in position and operative around the  outside
of  the  building,  they had run scan checks. Therefore, they had
assumed, the truth-telling must still be going on.
 
But there was nothing.
 
Then, as their eyes  became  accustomed  to  the  darkness,  they
spotted  a  dull red glow in a corner, and behind the glow a live
shadow. They swung a torch round on to it.
 
Prak was lounging on a bench, smoking a listless cigarette.
 
"Hi," he said, with a little half-wave. His voice echoed  through
the  chamber.  He was a little man with scraggy hair. He sat with
his shoulders  hunched  forward  and  his  head  and  knees  kept
jiggling. He took a drag of his cigarette.
 
They stared at him.
 
"What's going on?" said Trillian.
 
"Nothing," said the man and jiggled his shoulders.
 
Arthur shone his torch full on Prak's face.
 
"We thought," he said, "that you were meant  to  be  telling  the
Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth."
 
"Oh, that," said Prak. "Yeah. I  was.  I  finished.  There's  not
nearly  as  much  of  it  as  people imagine. Some of it's pretty
funny, though."
 
He suddenly exploded in about three seconds of  manical  laughter
and  stopped again. he sat there, jiggling his head and knees. He
dragged on his cigarette with a strange half-smile.
 
Ford and Zaphod came forward out of the shadows.
 
"Tell us about it," said Ford.
 
"Oh, I can't remember any of it now," said Prak.  "I  thought  of
writing  some of it down, but first I couldn't find a pencil, and
then I thought, why bother?"
 
There was a long silence, during which they  thought  they  could
feel the Universe age a little. Prak stared into the torchlight.
 
"None of it?" said Arthur at last. "You can remember none of it?"
 
"No. Except most of the good bits were about  frogs,  I  remember
that."
 
Suddenly he was hooting with laughter again and stamping his feet
on the ground.
 
"You would not believe  some  of  the  things  about  frogs,"  he
gasped.  "Come on let's go and find ourselves a frog. Boy, will I
ever see them in a new light!" He leapt to his  feet  and  did  a
tiny  little  dance.  Then he stopped and took a long drag at his
cigarette.
 
"Let's find a frog I can laugh at," he said simply. "Anyway,  who
are you guys?"
 
"We came to find you," said Trillian,  deliberately  not  keeping
the disappointment out of her voice. "My name is Trillian."
 
Prak jiggled his head.
 
"Ford Prefect," said Ford Prefect with a shrug.
 
Prak jiggled his head.
 
"And I," said Zaphod, when he judged that the  silence  was  once
again  deep enough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be
tossed in lightly, "am Zaphod Beeblebrox."
 
Prak jiggled his head.
 
"Who's this guy?" said Prak jiggling his shoulder at Arthur,  who
was standing silent for a moment, lost in disappointed thoughts.
 
"Me?" said Arthur. "Oh, my name's Arthur Dent."
 
Prak's eyes popped out of his head.
 
"No kidding?" he yelped. "You are Arthur Dent? The Arthur Dent?"
 
He staggered backwards, clutching his stomach and convulsed  with
fresh paroxysms o laughter.
 
"Hey, just think of meeting you!" he gasped. "Boy,"  he  shouted,
"you are the most ... wow, you just leave the frogs standing!"
 
he howled and screamed with laughter. He fell over  backwards  on
to  the bench. He hollered and yelled in hysterics. He cried with
laughter, he kicked his legs in  the  air,  he  beat  his  chest.
Gradually  he  subsided, panting. He looked at them. He looked at
Arthur. He fell back again howling with laughter.  Eventually  he
fell asleep.
 
Arthur stood there with his  lips  twitching  whilst  the  others
carried Prak comatose on to the ship.
 
"Before we picked up Prak," said Arthur, "I was going to leave. I
still want to, and I think I should do so as soon as possible."
 
The others nodded in silence, a silence which was  only  slightly
undermined by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical
laughter which came drifting from Prak's cabin  at  the  farthest
end of the ship.
 
"We have questioned him," continued Arthur,  "or  at  least,  you
have  questioned  him  -  I,  as you know, can't go near him - on
everything, and he  doesn't  really  seem  to  have  anything  to
contribute.  Just the occasional snippet, and things I don't want
to hear about frogs."
 
The others tried not to smirk.
 
"Now, I am the first to appreciate a joke," said Arthur and  then
had to wait for the others to stop laughing.
 
"I am the first ..." he stopped again. This time he  stopped  and
listened  to  the  silence. There actually was silence this time,
and it had come very suddenly.
 
Prak was quiet. For days they had  lived  with  constant  manical
laughter  ringing  round  the ship, only occasionally relieved by
short periods of light giggling and sleep. Arthur's very soul was
clenched with paranoia.
 
This was not the silence of sleep. A buzzer sounded. A glance  at
a board told them that the buzzer had been sounded by Prak.
 
"He's not well," said Trillian quietly. "The constant laughing is
completely wrecking his body."
 
Arthur's lips twitched but he said nothing.
 
"We'd better go and see him," said Trillian.
 
Trillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face.
 
"He wants you to go in," she said to Arthur, who was wearing  his
glum  and  tight-lipped  one.  He  thrust his hands deep into his
dressing-gown pockets and tried to  think  of  something  to  say
which  wouldn't  sound  petty.  It seemed terribly unfair, but he
couldn't.
 
"Please," said Trillian.
 
He shrugged and went in, taking his glum  and  tight-lipped  face
with him, despite the reaction this always provoked from Prak.
 
He looked down at his tormentor, who was  lying  quietly  on  the
bed,  ashen  and wasted. His breathing was very shallow. Ford and
Zaphod were standing by the bed looking awkward.
 
"You wanted to ask me something," said Prak in a thin  voice  and
coughed slightly.
 
Just the cough made Arthur stiffen, but it passed and subsided.
 
"How do you know that?" he asked.
 
Prak shrugged weakly. "'Cos it's true," he said simply.
 
Arthur took the point.
 
"Yes," he said at last in rather a strained drawl. "I did have  a
question.  Or rather, what I actually have is an Answer. I wanted
to know what the Question was."
 
Prak nodded sympathetically, and Arthur relaxed a little.
 
"It's ... well, it's a long story," he said, "but the Question  I
would like to know is the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe
and Everything. All we know is  that  the  Answer  is  Forty-Two,
which is a little aggravating."
 
Prak nodded again.
 
"Forty-Two," he said. "Yes, that's right."
 
He paused. Shadows of thought and memory crossed  his  face  like
the shadows of clouds crossing the land.
 
"I'm afraid," he said at last, "that the Question and the  Answer
are  mutually  exclusive.  Knowledge  of  one logically precludes
knowledge of the other. It is impossible that both  can  ever  be
known about the same universe."
 
He paused again. Disappointment  crept  into  Arthur's  face  and
snuggled down into its accustomed place.
 
"Except," said Prak, struggling to sort a  thought  out,  "if  it
happened,  it  seems  that the Question and the Answer would just
cancel each other out and take  the  Universe  with  them,  which
would   then   be  replaced  by  something  even  more  bizarrely
inexplicable. It is possible that this has already happened,"  he
added  with  a  weak  smile,  "but  there  is a certain amount of
Uncertainty about it."
 
A little giggle brushed through him.
 
Arthur sat down on a stool.
 
"Oh well," he said with resignation, "I  was  just  hoping  there
would be some sort of reason."
 
"Do you know," said Prak, "the story of the Reason?"
 
Arthur said that he didn't, and Prak said that he  knew  that  he
didn't.
 
He told it.
 
One night, he said, a spaceship appeared in the sky of  a  planet
which  had  never  seen one before. The planet was Dalforsas, the
ship was this one. It appeared as a  brilliant  new  star  moving
silently across the heavens.
 
Primitive  tribesmen  who  were  sitting  huddled  on  the   Cold
Hillsides  looked up from their steaming night-drinks and pointed
with trembling fingers, swearing that they had  seen  a  sign,  a
sign from their gods which meant that they must now arise at last
and go and slay the evil Princes of the Plains.
 
In the high turrets of their palaces, the Princes of  the  Plains
looked  up and saw the shining star, and received it unmistakably
as a sign from their gods that they must now go and set about the
accursed Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides.
 
And between them, the Dwellers in the Forest looked up  into  the
sky  and  saw  the sigh of the new star, and saw it with fear and
apprehension, for though they had never  seen  anything  like  it
before,  they  too  knew precisely what it foreshadowed, and they
bowed their heads in despair.
 
They knew that when the rains came, it was a sign.
 
When the rains departed, it was a sign.
 
When the winds rose, it was a sign.
 
When the winds fell, it was a sign.
 
When in the land there was born at midnight of a full moon a goat
with three heads, that was a sign.
 
When in the land there was born at some time in the  afternoon  a
perfectly  normal  cat or pig with no birth complications at all,
or even just a child with a retrousse nose, that too would  often
be taken as a sign.
 
So there was no doubt at all that a new star in  the  sky  was  a
sign of a particularly spectacular order.
 
And each new sign signified the same thing - that the Princes  of
the  Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides were about to
beat the hell out of each other again.
 
This in itself wouldn't be so bad, except that the Princes of the
Plains  and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides always elected to
beat the hell out of each other in the Forest, and it was  always
the Dwellers in the Forest who came off worst in these exchanges,
though as far as they could see it never had anything to do  with
them.
 
And sometimes, after some of the worst  of  these  outrages,  the
Dwellers  in  the  Forest  would  send  a messenger to either the
leader of the  Princes  of  the  Plains  or  the  leader  of  the
Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides and demand to know the reason for
this intolerable behaviour.
 
And the leader, whichever one it was, would  take  the  messenger
aside  and  explain  the  Reason to him, slowly and carefully and
with great attention to the considerable detail involved.
 
And the terrible thing was, it was a very good one. It  was  very
clear,  very  rational,  and  tough. The messenger would hang his
head and feel sad and foolish that he had  not  realized  what  a
tough and complex place the real world was, and what difficulties
and paradoxes had to be embraced if one was to live in it.
 
"Now do you understand?" the leader would say.
 
The messenger would nod dumbly.
 
"And you see these battles have to take place?"
 
Another dumb nod.
 
"And why they have to take place in the forest, and why it is  in
everybody's  best  interest,  the  Forest Dwellers included, that
they should?"
 
"Er ..."
 
"In the long run."
 
"Er, yes."
 
And the messenger did understand the Reason, and he  returned  to
his people in the Forest. But as he approached them, as he walked
through the Forest and amongst the trees, he found  that  all  he
could  remember of the Reason was how terribly clear the argument
had seemed. What it actually was he couldn't remember at all.
 
And this, of course, was a great comfort when next the  Tribesmen
and  the  Princes  came hacking and burning their way through the
Forest, killing every Forest Dweller in their way.
 
Prak paused in his story and coughed pathetically.
 
"I was the messenger," he said, "after the  battles  precipitated
by  the  appearance of your ship, which were particularly savage.
Many of our people died. I thought I could bring the Reason back.
I  went  and was told it by the leader of the Princes, but on the
way back it slipped and melted away in my mind like snow  in  the
sun. That was many years ago, and much has happened since then."
 
He looked up at Arthur and giggled again very gently.
 
"There is one other thing I can remember  from  the  truth  drug.
Apart  from  the  frogs,  and  that  is God's last message to his
creation. Would you like to hear it?"
 
For a moment they didn't know whether to take him seriously.
 
"'Strue," he said. "For real. I mean it."
 
His chest heaved weakly and he struggled  for  breath.  His  head
lolled slightly.
 
"I wasn't very impressed with it when I first knew what it  was,"
he  said,  "but  now  I  think back to how impressed I was by the
Prince's Reason, and how soon afterwards I couldn't recall it  at
all,  I  think  it might be a lot more helpful. Would you like to
know what it is? Would you?"
 
They nodded dumbly.
 
"I bet you would. If you're that interested I suggest you go  and
look for it. It is written in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on
top  of  the  Quentulus  Quazgar  Mountains  in   the   land   of
Sevorbeupstry  on  the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the sun
Zarss in Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma. It is guarded by the
Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob."
 
There was a long silence following this announcement,  which  was
finally broken by Arthur.
 
"Sorry, it's where?" he said.
 
"It is written," repeated Prak, "in thirty-foot-high  letters  of
fire  on  top  of  the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of
Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the ..."
 
"Sorry," said Arthur again, "which mountains?"
 
"The Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry  on
the planet ..."
 
"Which land was that? I didn't quite catch it."
 
"Sevorbeupstry, on the planet ..."
 
"Sevorbe-what?"
 
"Oh, for heaven's sake," said Prak and died testily.
 
In the following days Arthur thought a little about this message,
but  in the end he decided that he was not going to allow himself
to be drawn by it, and insisted on following his original plan of
finding  a  nice little world somewhere to settle down and lead a
quiet retired life. Having saved the Universe twice in one day he
thought that he could take things a little easier from now on.
 
They dropped him off on the planet Krikkit, which  was  now  once
again   an   idyllic  pastoral  world,  even  if  the  songs  did
occasionally get on his nerves.
 
He spent a lot of time flying.
 
He learnt to communicate with birds  and  discovered  that  their
conversation was fantastically boring. It was all to do with wind
speed, wing spans, power-to-weight ratios and a  fair  bit  about
berries.  Unfortunately,  he  discovered,  once  you  have learnt
birdspeak you quickly come to realize that the air is full of  it
the whole time, just inane bird chatter. There is no getting away
from it.
 
For that reason Arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to
live  on  the  ground  and  love  it,  despite a lot of the inane
chatter he heard down there as well.
 
One day, he was walking through the fields  humming  a  ravishing
tune  he'd  heard recently when a silver spaceship descended from
the sky and landed in front of him.
 
A hatchway opened, a ramp extended, and a tall  grey-green  alien
marched out and approached him.
 
"Arthur Phili ..." it said, then glanced sharply at him and  down
at his clipboard. He frowned. He looked up at him again.
 
"I've done you before haven't I?" he said.

            Introduction to the Neolithic Great Goddess

     Welcome to an overview of the Neolithic Great Goddess of Old
Europe.  Before we start, a word about her name.  The name 'Great
Goddess' is synonomous in my usage with 'White Goddess' (cf
Graves 1966) and I shall use the terms interchangeably. One of
the primary epiphanies of the Great Goddess was the White Goddess
of Death and Regeneration, which held a particular fascintion for
Robert Graves as he attempted to trace her survival in the
Medieval and Renaissance Celtic world.

     This text was written with a several goals in mind.  When
Marija Gimbutas (1989) published The Language of the Goddess in
1989, a landmark work of scholarship was made available to the
public.  This study is not only unique, it carries the stamp of
authenticity and quality.  It is the first in-depth overview of
the Neolithic Great Goddess that draws upon the wealth of
archeological and mytho-poetic evidence from Old Europe.  Old
Europe was a cultural area in what is now Eastern and Central
Europe that was unified by virtue of its mytho-poetics.  Each
culture had a social and religious structure determined by the
mytho-poetics of the Great Goddess and this unity lasted for
several thousand years.  Specifically, the evidence from
Yugoslavia, Thessaly, the Balkans, Transylvania, Moldavia and the
Ukraine is sifted, interpreted and then intergrated with that
from Iberia, France, Italy, Sardinia, Malta, and NW Europe.  The
result of this magnificent synthesis is the first comprehensive
look at the Great Goddess in all of her complex manifestations,
metaphors and ritual.

     Given the success of Gimbutas' work, one may ask why write
about it?  I would not have done so, if I felt there was not
something I could contribute that is not present. For all of its
brilliance, her writing at times is quite disorganized and the
chronology often falls apart as folk tales are told and commented
upon.  Also, much of the important information in the book is
contained in captions to illustrations.  This forces a
disjointed, back and forth reading process and, indeed, almost
guarantees that several readings are necessary to gain a complete
understanding of the material.  My first objective was to compile
a detailed outline of the Goddess' iconography and derived
metaphor according to the scheme presented by Gimbutas, but
paying stricter adherence to the historical chronology. 
Gimbutas' tripartite division of the Goddess' mytho-poetics into
Life Giving, Death and Regeneration and Energy Unfolding is
brilliant and I have no wish to modify it.  This outline is of
great use to me as I search for the Great Goddess elsewhere and
contemplate her specific metaphors in other times and places
(Blumenberg 1992a, 1992b).  The White Goddess was not restricted
to Old Europe and the nearby regions; Gimbutas does not journey
to India, Tibet, China or Japan and her exploration into Celtic
realms and ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia and the
Mediterranean is incomplete.  Perhaps this 'field guide' to the
Great Goddess will be of interest and value to you.

     I also wished to present my original thoughts and
interpretations for your contemplative pleasure and mid-way
through this text you will begin to come upon them.  I pereceive
a four layers of iconography, that may be found both as discrete
categories or in combination.  There are extensions to the modern
realm of genetics and evolution that are apparent and I wish to
explore those in order to widen the parameters for that never-to-
be-achieved final synthesis.  The Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind
(Janes 1976) is a provocative hypothesis that has been exiled by
most scholars and laypersons and I wish to bring it into the
arena of possible models and mechanisms behind surface reality. 
The fundamental principle behind 'chaotic phenonmena', as
strictly defined by modern physics, may be seen in these mytho-
poetics and I wish to briefly introduce that possibility. Another
study will explore Chaos in cultural and biological evolution in
detail.  Finally, I desired to demonstrate the usefulness of the
'field guide' by exploring an interpretation of Joseph Campbell
(1988) regarding an artefact of the Paleolithic Goddess that I
believe misconstrues what is present and draws conclusions that
are unwarranted.

     This software 'volume' is the first in the series about the
Great Goddess now being published by Reality Software; those
publications ocurring out of sequential order.  If you have our
other packages about Celtic Realms and/or China and Japan, this
text will greatly enrich the exploration of those materials,
although they are self-contained.  If you have not yet previewed
them, two files in this package will allow you to do so and I
hope they spark your interest.  Also scheduled for release in
1992, are packages about the Great Goddess in India and Tibet and
in early 1993, one about the Great Goddess in ancient Mesopotamia
and the Classical Mediterranean world.

=========================================================================================
                  THE COCK, THE CAT, AND THE MOUSE

   Once upon a time . . . a little mouse decided to go and see the world. 
Packing some food for the journey, he carefully locked his door and set off 
for the unknown. And what a wonderful world he saw! Tall trees, rolling 
countryside, flowers and butterflies he had never set eyes on before. On he 
hiked till, tired out, he came to a peasant's cottage. After eating some of 
his packed lunch, he thought he would inspect what, to him, was a peculiar 
sort of building. He entered the farmyard and his eyes grew round as saucers: 
there in front of him were two strange animals he had never seen before. One
was large and handsome, with four legs, covered all over with soft fur, and 
sporting splendid white whiskers that gave it a solemn respectable air. It was
dozing against the wall. The other, a two-legged creature, had red, yellow and
green feathers and a fierce, bad-tempered look. A pair of cruel eyes in a 
red-crested head glared at the little mouse.
   "How do you do, sir! How do you do..." began the mouse's greeting, as he 
felt foollsh at not knowing the stranger's name. But the feathered creature 
simply puffed out its chest, screeched a loud "Cocka-doodle-doo!" and strutted
towards the mouse, now paralyzed with fear. The little mouse saw the big 
yellow beak hovering over him. "I must run!" he squeaked, turning tail and 
fleeing as fast as his legs would carry him. He spied a hole in the wall and 
dived into it. Inside, three faces stared at him in amazement. 
   "Where did you appear from?" they asked. 
   "I've come . . ." gasped the little mouse breathlessly, ". . . from far 
away! Where am I now?"
   "This is our home. We're field mice. What happened?" And the little mouse 
told them about the animals he had met in the farmyard: one handsome and 
harmless, the other brightly coloured and ferocious. The three field mice 
laughed. "Calm down," they said. "Have a cup of coffee. Don't you realize the 
danger you were in? The creature that frightened you is only a cock, but the 
nice harmless one is our deadliest enemy, the cat! If he'd seen you, you 
wouldn't be here to tell the tale. As you see, you can't always judge by 
appearances!"

The night Maggie Whitehurst hanged herself, I was sixty
miles away, fishing with her husband.  Well, her estranged
husband, as they say on the television news.

I spent a lot of time cleaning in the months following the
final divorce decree.  I cleaned the house.  I mean all of
the house, scrubbing the little brown stains out of the
corners of the bathroom.  I scrubbed the floors of the
kitchen and the utility room on my hands and knees with a
brush, then waxed the floors to a brilliant shine anyone who
watches daytime television commercials would have been proud
of.  I could see myself.  I shampooed the carpets, bought
new curtains for the bedroom, and a new bedspread.  I had a
dent bumped out of an old Mustang I had picked up cheap in
the Auto Trader, and then had the whole car painted metallic
red.  I always wanted a red car, and I always wanted a
Mustang.  I scrubbed as much of the corrosion as I could
from the brightwork of my little boat, replaced the
refrigerator in the kitchen, and painted the trim on the
duplex I shared with my friend, Wesley Chin.  I'm not sure
exactly what caused my sudden interest in cleanliness, other
than some Freudian reaction to one of my father's favorite
sayings about "getting one's house in order".  I also ended
up cleaning out my desk at the television station where I
worked.  That wasn't my choice, though.  It was theirs,
after management decided they didn't like my face much
anymore, either.

Sagging ratings at six and eleven brought in a consultant
from Iowa, who hooked up a pack of "viewers" to a machine
that measures "Galvanic Skin Response".  In short, my
picture on the screen didn't make their palms sweaty enough.
They brought in the latest blow-dried model from Dubuque to
replace me, at about half the cost.  They were, however,
perfectly willing to pay me for the eighteen months
remaining on my contract - provided, of course, I did not
seek employment at one of the two other network affiliates
in town.  I had no desire to do so.  At thirty seven years
of age, and after fifteen years in the business, I was just
about televisioned out.

My friend Wesley told me I was a very lucky man.  He was
referring to two things.  First, thanks to the contract
payout, I was not in any immediate need of work, and could,
in fact, live very comfortably for the next year or so doing
absolutely nothing, or as he put it, "less than nothing".

"Doing nothing," he said, "implies that you are unemployed,
and have no desire to seek employment.  I would suggest that
you really work at doing nothing.  You have gone through the
hit parade of stressful situations in the past few months."
He counted them off on his fingers.  "One, you have gone
through a separation and divorce.  Two, you have lost your
job.  Three, you've moved to a new home, and four, you have
substantially changed your lifestyle.  You need therapy,
Brad.  A little short-term stress reduction wouldn't hurt.
Of course, being the manly super-hero you are, that is
unthinkable.  I'm suggesting you really revel in the
nothingness of the things you do.  Get plenty of sleep,
drink plenty of liquor, if that's what you want to do, and
generally clean out your head as well as you've cleaned up
the apartment.  Jesus, If you really want to clean, come on
down to my place."

He also said there were much worse places to be single and
thirty-seven than Virginia Beach, Virginia in the
summertime.  Wesley was referring, of course, to the large
number of tourists who populate the beaches in the
summertime.  Many (I have it on good authority about half)
of these tourists are women, who seek the sun and sand the
city's tourism bureau is fond of publicizing in its
brochures.  I have lived in Virginia beach an even dozen
years, and have never seen any of the places where all of
these beautiful pictures are taken.  I firmly believe the
photos are taken somewhere else.  Hawaii, for instance, then
plugged into the Virginia Beach literature.  The brochures
show blue, blue cloudless skies, with romantic couples
silhouetted toasting each other with wine, looking out over
a white beach with multi-colored umbrellas.  In reality, the
weather comes pounding out of the mountains, then comes to a
screeching halt when it hits the confluence of the
Chesapeake Bay and the Ocean, leaving the sky an interesting
shade of orange at times.  When I was a reporter, I used to
do stories this time of year about elderly people who didn't
have or couldn't afford to run their air conditioning.  This
time of year was tougher than the cold days of winter.  Air
conditioning for them is just as much a necessity as a
furnace in the winter.  Nothing moves then, the winds die,
and the air fills up with the gunk and smutch of industry
and autos.  The temperature goes up and up into the mid-
nineties, along with the humidity.  The beach isn't even
real.  Most of the sand is trucked in from well inland,
since the spring storms wash away most of what's there every
year, right up to the boardwalk's seawall.  And God forbid
any of the city's police officers catch you with a wine
glass anywhere near the beach.

Virginia Beach is not Hawaii.  It's not Florida, either, if
only because its season is different.  It is mostly a
summertime resort, mostly for middle-income and working-
class people from New York, Pennsylvania, and for some
reason I cannot fathom, Canada.  The signs welcoming you to
the city ("World's Largest Resort City") are in both English
and French, and many of the hotels fly both United States
and Canadian flags out front, in respect for our neighbors
to the north, and their strange colored currency.  But it is
home, and has been for the past ten years.

Wesley says the normal reaction of many men in my position
would be to take my little red Mustang down to the beach,
find myself one or more young women around the age of
twenty, and have myself one hell of a summer.  Frankly, the
thought of doing that would scare me to death.  For one,
what would you talk about afterward?  The latest "Guns and
Roses" album?  The latest hits on MTV?  The prospect did
nothing for me.  I had, however, gone surf fishing once or
twice along the tourist strip, and had noticed that a large
proportion of the women were single, and appeared to be
between the ages of say, thirty and forty, well within the
range of my consideration.  My shrink says that's progress.
Yes, I have a shrink, too, and Wesley says that's progress.

My wife, well now ex-wife, Barbara, had decided our life
together was not moving forward quickly enough to suit her.
Whatever the hell that means.  She wanted more of a
commitment.  Marriage is a commitment, I told her.  When the
time came for Barbara and I to settle up the inventory we
had acquired in twelve years of marriage, guilt played
heavily in my decision to be the one who moved out, leaving
a good-sized home, the "good" car, and much of the furniture
in her name.  I retained the interest in a rental property I
had invested in with Wesley, my old car, and the boat.
Wesley already lived in the lower floor of the duplex.  When
the tenant upstairs moved out, I moved in on a "temporary"
basis, and paid our little partnership rent at the going
rate, six-month lease and all.

Wesley Chin got in on the ground floor of the computer
revolution.  He's a year older than I am, but looks ten
younger.  Early in his career, his expertise led to a pair
of college texts, one a simple introduction to computers,
for most any "Computer Science 101" class, the other a
highly technical, graduate level text on networking
computers, linking several machines, or several hundred, or
several thousand together.  It's how, for example, K-Mart
World headquarters in Troy, Michigan, can tell when a
package of chewing gum is sold at the store in Boca Raton,
Florida.  Although he keeps telling me he's overdue to crank
out a third textbook ("Alternate Reality is the hot new
area," he says), he makes a good living by keeping the other
two current.  A "second edition" and "third edition",
updating the techno-world of computers do well in killing
the used book market for college students, and they keep the
cash register ringing, money flowing into Wesley's bank
account.  The Mexican restaurant he bought from the
royalties also helps.  It's called "Chin's Tijuana Palace",
and to my knowledge, it's the only Mexican restaurant that
serves fortune cookies with the check.  It's on the tourist
strip, Atlantic Avenue, which runs right along the line of
big hotels on the oceanfront.  The tourists like gimmicks,
and it's something they remember to tell their friends when
they head back to Montreal, Albany, or Harrisburg.

It had been one of those hazy, humid, close kind of
Saturdays in late July at Chesapeake Beach.  Not much wind
to speak of, if at all.  Being outside on days like this
makes me feel as if I need hot rocks and branches to beat
myself with.  Compared to some parts of Virginia Beach,
Chesapeake Beach is low-rent.  The big cedar jobs on stilts
line the ocean beaches; four, five, six bedroom homes that
cost several hundred thousand dollars, only get used in the
summertime, and cost a bundle to insure because of the
hurricane threat every year.

Chesapeake Beach faces the bay instead.  The residents
mostly live here year-round in everything from cinderblock
huts to homes of a little (but not much) more substance.
The houses here are older, shorter, squatted between the
dunes and scrub, out of necessity, taking the full brunt of
spring's northeast winds.  The tourist strip and the
tourists are right around the corner, but they're mostly out
of sight, and mercifully, don't wander much to our stretch
of sand.

Wesley and I had been doing some work on the upper deck that
sits atop the duplex we share facing the bay.  Ours was not
on stilts, sitting far enough from the shore that we had a
wide beach, and few spring flooding problems.  We became
partners in the house a couple of years back, introduced by
a real estate agent who puts together such deals for rental
properties.  It was sweaty work.  A section of the deck near
the wall was beginning to rot.  Even the green salt-treated
lumber has trouble holding up to the heat and humidity along
the water.  Owning a waterfront house here means constant
maintenance.  Inside, the big Kenwood was locked in to WNSB.
Herbie Mann was driving the big E-V speakers with just
enough power to go cruising by flute.  We were both covered
with sawdust kicked up by the table saw downstairs.

We were working up an appetite, and had been discussing the
merits of a bushel of clams and a bucket of ice-cold
Stroh's.  A few of the other people from up the beach had
wandered by, offering carpentry tips in exchange for cold
beer.  As the work wound down, Bill and Ramona Baker had
fetched the clams, Pete and Sharon Crosby had rolled up with
more beer, Tom Scott showed, and we wound up sitting on the
deck, clams on the Weber Kettle, watching the dirty pink
sunset.  The party, if you want to call it that, turned into
one of those events where people drift in and out, catching
up on the latest neighborhood gossip, bitching about what
the city council is up to now, coveting their neighbors
spouses, and discussing in no particular order, the middle
east, the American League East, the city's poor excuse for
garbage collection, and traffic on the expressway.  I
suppose we topped out at about fifteen or twenty people,
although there were never more than eight or nine around at
a time.

Around eleven, the married couples had tottered off to their
kids and to sleep in preparation for early tee-times and
early church services in the morning.  Only the three
bachelors were left; Wesley, Tom, and me, staring out at the
boats that bobbed out around the islands of the Chesapeake
Bay Bridge-Tunnel, that seventeen-mile span that crosses
over and under the mouth of the Bay.  A breeze had come up,
blowing the pollution into someone else's air.  You could
smell it.  Rain was maybe eight hours away.

  Wesley is short, compact, and muscular, sort of like a
fire plug with black hair and glasses.  Tom is tall and
lanky, with red hair, and an ever-present sunburn.  Aside
from the fact that he's a very liberal attorney, an officer
in the Virginia Chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union, he could be the kind of good ole boy with a full
rifle rack in his Ford pickup.  His neck is that red.  His
rifle rack, however, is full of fishing rods, with a tackle
box in the capped bed.

"Must be good fishing tonight," Wesley commented, looking
out at the boats around the bridge islands.

"The bluefish are running," Tom said.

"They sure would taste good for Sunday dinner," Wesley said.

They both looked at me.

"You guys want to go fishing, take the boat, I can take a
hint," I pulled the keys out of my pocket, and tossed them
to Tom.

"Aw, come on Brad," Wesley said.  "come with us.  Blow some
stink off."

"You are incredibly confused, my confusing friend.  Fishing
does not blow stink off, Wesley.  Fishing puts stink on.  I
am not interested tonight.  If you two want to go, take
off."

Wesley glanced at Tom, and smiled.  "Is Robin working at the
marina tonight?"

"I think so."

"Fuck you both," I said.  "let's go."  Tom grinned, and got
his gear and a jacket from the truck.  Wesley locked up.

The marina, and its adjacent pier, is about three-hundred
yards down the beach at Lynnhaven Inlet.  It was not planned
the way it looks, it just sort of grew the way it did.  The
old plank pier goes back to the forties, and sticks some
two-hundred feet into the Bay, adjacent to the inlet.  At
the foot of the pier stands the bait shop and office, built
sometime in the fifties.  The sixties brought the first of
the docks, and a small Butler building as a service
facility.  The seventies, however, saw the marina business
mushroom.  Newer concrete piers with big timbers and
galvanized bolts holding it all together.  A modern brick-
and-vinyl-sided building for lockers, shower facilities, and
a fish market that will clean what you catch, or sell you
what you didn't.  The next step was to be a restaurant and
small motel, that no doubt, would grow on into the next
century.  You couldn't build it from scratch the way it had
grown unless you had quite a vision, and a lot of money.

We walked.  By the time we got there, it was about eleven-
thirty, and the complex, "Bubba's Lynnhaven Fishing Center",
was busy with a wide variety of fisher-folks:  the wealthy,
in their designer clothes with little animals on the
pockets, taking the Bertram for a late-night spin, whole
families of the poor, mom and dad and the kids, both black
and white, hoping to catch Sunday's crab dinner from the
pier, using chicken necks tied to a string, and the three of
us, somewhere in the middle, lined up to buy bait.  Robin
was, indeed, working.

Robin Williams (I swear) is a big, tall lady who manages the
place for Ed Shaw, known to his friends as...you guessed it,
Bubba.  She has very short black hair, and strong features.
This particular evening, she was barelegged, wearing red
shorts, an Old Dominion University sweatshirt, and
surprisingly clean white Reeboks.  Her features are angular
enough to look a little masculine, although there is nothing
at all masculine about the legs, or the way she filled the
sweatshirt.  She is very tan, with a scattering of freckles
across the bridge of her nose, darker tan than mine, and I
had been working at it pretty good,  It made her cool blue
eyes look very vivid, and her teeth look very white.  You
would not confuse her with the comedian, despite the name.
Thirty?  Maybe, give or take five to seven either way.  Hard
to guess her age because her face had that sharply-chiseled
look that doesn't show much decay between eighteen and forty
or so.

I met Robin when I first got the boat, about the same time
as the duplex.  It was a 1947 twenty four foot Chris-Craft
cruiser, purchased from a family up on the Eastern Shore.
It was not in good shape.  The family had used it as a crab
boat.  With the help of the mechanics at the marina, we had
swapped the old mill out with a new Ford four-cylinder,
scrubbed most of the pea green paint off the mahogany,
updated the instrument cluster with digital units, and
repaired or replaced most of the brightwork with original
pieces they had helped me track down.  Robin wrote the
receipts for the checks I had stroked to fill this hole in
the water.  She also helped me christen the little tub, the
"Talking Head", a television term for the tight shots of
faces you see most often on news broadcasts.  Robin thought
it an amusing name, since "head" is the nautical term for
"toilet".  The boat still needed a lot of work, but then, so
did I.  Two years ago, when I first met her, Robin also
sported a yellow wedding band on her left hand.  That
adornment had recently turned up missing.  I was curious,
and frankly, interested.

"Brad!  Brad Streeter!"

I knew without looking that the voice that came across the
crowded shop was Bobby Whitehurst's.  I had not seen him in
some time.  I turned to greet him, wondering what kind of
reception I was going to get, not exactly knowing if I was
going to be greeted warmly or slugged in the face.  He was
smiling.  I was relieved.

"Bobby...good to see you."  It was not particularly good to
see him.  So I lied.  "You coming or going?"  I hoped he was
coming, and going home to his wife.

"Going.  You know, the blues are running."  He jerked a
thumb out toward the bay.

"Yeah, I heard,"  I motioned at Wesley and Tom, across the
shop.  "Bobby Whitehurst...I think you've met Wesley.  This
is Tom Scott."  Bobby shook hands with Tom, nodded
recognition, then shook hands with Wesley.  "Bobby lived
next door when I lived with Barbara," I said, to no one in
particular.

"We've met each other once or twice around the courthouse,"
Tom said with a grin.

"More than that," Bobby said.  "This old boy took one of my
clients for a bunch of money."

"Now, Bobby," Tom said.  "He shouldn't have locked them out
of their house."

"It was his house, and they hadn't paid the rent."

"You guys gonna try this one again here, or are we gonna
fish?"  Wesley said with a smile.

Bobby looked at Tom, holding his fishing pole and tackle
box.  "You guys going out?"

"Sure," Tom said.  "Want to come along?  The beer is cold."

"Sure.  Beats cleaning out my boat by myself afterward."

So the four of us piled into my boat, and cruised out the
inlet, headed for open water.  Once we were anchored near
the bridge, Wesley and Tom sat on the bow, casting out into
the pilings nearest the island.  Bobby and I sat at the
stern, casting the other direction.  Bobby is a good-looking
fellow, with close-cropped blond hair.  Tall, loud and
gregarious.  The Whitehursts were Virginia born for
generations back, from that hardy, earnest, hungry stock
which had scared the living hell out of the federal troops
they had faced during the War Between the States.  He was a
year or two younger than me, his eyes a pale, watery blue,
blonde hair thinning a little.  I guess you'd say he had a
little bit of a baby face.  Since I'd known him, he'd tried
a beard once or twice, but always shaved it off, because he
said it made him look like a leftover from the sixties.

Bobby and Maggie, Barbara and me.  The four of us were
pretty much inseparable when we lived next door to each
other.  Vacations together, holidays together, Saturday
night dinners together.  There's an interesting phenomenon
about married couples.  When one marriage goes down the
hatch, the strain is usually too much on the "couples
friends" they've developed.  I hadn't seen Bobby since I
moved out of the house.

"How's Maggie?"

An embarrassed smile.  "She moved out about six weeks ago.
Went to stay with her folks in North Carolina for a while."

That's the other thing about separation and divorce.  It's
contagious.  "Temporary or permanent?"

"I don't know."  Bobby sat down in a heap on the seat at the
stern.  "Said she needed some time to get some things
straight, and put some things behind her.  I offered to take
some time off...to go on a cruise, or a vacation somewhere.
Maybe a trip across the country.  She said no, had some
things to take care of at home with her dad.  Said she
wanted to get rid of some demons..."  His voice trailed off.
He looked me in the eye for the first time since we met at
the bait shop.  "I think she's going to file for divorce,
and she just wants me to get used to the idea."

I can't exactly say it was a shock.  Maggie and Bobby had
their share of problems, even back in the days when the four
of us were running around together.  Bobby has never had
what you would call a booming law practice, although he is
an above average attorney when it comes to civil matters.
His has always been a one-man office, with a part-time
secretary to answer the phone when he's off to court, or
looking up old deeds, or doing all those things attorneys
do.  When he was between secretaries, Maggie helped out,
that's how they met, but mostly she stayed home.  Bobby had
turned down several offers to join other firms, both big and
small, always saying he'd rather be his own boss.  The fact
that Bobby always seemed to be struggling was the source of
much friction between Maggie and Bobby over the years.
Maggie would see people her age at the sort of parties
lawyers and their wives attend, and wonder why she and Bobby
didn't have a home on the beach, a Mercedes in the driveway,
and a condo on the ski slopes at Masanutten or wherever.  In
short, Maggie thought Bobby didn't try hard enough...didn't
"apply" himself enough, as she used to say.  But they had
always hung in there, apparently until recently.

He spat over the side, downwind, with excellent accuracy and
velocity.  "I can't stand moping around like this,"  Bobby
said, and turned to holler at Wesley and Tom on the bow.
"Hey, guys, you getting any nibbles?  Brad.  Tell them about
the time the four of us..."

And so it went for the next couple of hours.  The time we
hiked all over Washington, D. C. sightseeing in the
sweltering summer heat.  The time we went to the Outer Banks
of North Carolina, rented a cottage on the ocean, got drunk,
and staged "West Side Story" on the beach in the moonlight,
ending up in the surf singing, "When you're a Jet you're a
Jet all the way..."

We tried the windward side of the island.  We tried the
leeward side of the island.  We went out to deeper water, we
headed north nearly to the Eastern Shore, and tried the
shallows.  The crabs chewed up the bait over and over again.

By five, we had just about given up.  The east sky was
getting brighter, and we headed south, back to Bubba's,
throttled down through the "no wake" zone at the mouth of
the inlet just as the sun began to come up over the horizon,
and idled down into the slip.  Robin was waiting for us at
the top of the dock, arms crossed.  She was not smiling.  A
white Virginia Beach Police car was parked on the gravel
near the dock.  As soon as Tom tied up, Robin called to
Bobby.

"Bobby," she called out.  "These officers are here to see
you."

The four of us looked at each other.  Bobby shrugged, and
said, "Maybe I'm being served with papers for one of my
cases.  It happens sometimes."

The officers were a Mutt and Jeff team.  The uniformed one
was a tall and skinny dark-haired fellow with a perfectly
tailored uniform.  The plainclothes officer, or detective,
or whatever, was blond, short, and stout.  Jeff spoke to
Bobby.

"Mister Whitehurst?"

"That's me,"  Bobby said.

"We need to speak with you for a moment."  He said to Robin,
"May we use your office?"

"Of course," she said.

We went to the bait shop, Bobby into the office with Jeff,
looking confused.  Mutt stood near the patrol car, drinking
coffee.  Robin shot me a look that said something was very
wrong.  We could hear the detective speaking to Bobby, but
could not make out what he was saying.  He was speaking in
very low, very soothing tones.  There was no mistaking,
however, the anguish in Bobby's voice when he shouted, "Oh
no!"

Then we heard Bobby talking very low, his voice barely
audible over the hum of the fluorescent tubes.  It was quiet
for another moment.  All four of us were bug-eyed, staring
at the office door when Bobby stepped out the door, and said
very quietly, "Maggie is dead.  They say she killed herself
last night out at her father's place."

Then he began crying.  Big, racking sobs.  The kind that
don't let you catch your breath.  He walked outside, sat
down on the step, and kept on crying.  The four of us looked
at each other.  Thank God Robin was the only one of us who
had any idea of what to do.  She sat down on the step next
to Bobby, put her arms around him in a big hug, and the two
of them rocked, back and forth.  She stroked his hair, and
whispered something into his ear, over and over.

My mind was somewhere else, I guess.  Actually, my mind was
in several locations at once.  There was another reason I
wasn't surprised Maggie had left Bobby.  She had fallen out
of love with Bobby several years before.  I knew this
because she had told me so in the bed we had shared for a
very brief period following my separation from Barbara.  For
a while, I believed she would leave him, I would leave
Barbara, and we would get together.

My shrink maintains that men are rarely ready to throw a
marriage into the dumper until they have found a new person
to begin a relationship with.  I thought about this a lot,
because I somehow had it in my mind that after the papers
were signed, and my marriage to Barbara finally consigned to
my past, I could begin over again with Maggie Whitehurst,
that she would leave Bobby, and we would have something.  I
played and replayed a lot of scenes in my head concerning
myself and Maggie.  I wondered often how things might have
been different.  Or better.  Or at least feel better.  I
wondered if I would ever see her again.  I wondered if I
should call her.  I sometimes wondered what would have
happened to my marriage if I had spent the same amount of
energy on my relationship with Barbara that I spent on
fantasizing about the past and possible future with Maggie.
I wondered if it made any difference at all.  The
relationship with Maggie began about two months after
Barbara and I split, and ended just before the final decree
was signed.  Maggie decided she could not take the stress of
carrying on with her best friend's husband, although their
relationship was not what it had been when I was living with
Barbara.  I don't know how it could have been.  The whole
thing wasn't doing much for my mental health, either.

As they say, it's all water under the bridge now.  There are
a lot of bridges in Virginia Beach.  And one whole ocean
full of water.

The Outer Banks of North Carolina is one of the more
beautiful places on the continent.  Getting there from
Virginia along route 168 is not exactly picturesque.  It is
one of the most boring 90 minute trips through truck farms,
tobacco fields, small towns, and Seven-Elevens on the face
of the planet.  The fields are only broken by an occasional
ramshackle house or mobile home...each with its own
satellite dish out back.  All of a sudden, when you're
thinking you will drive smack into a telephone pole just for
a little excitement, the road takes a big turn to the left,
and you get a breathtaking view of Pamlico Sound, and the
bridge that crosses it into the Outer Banks.

When the Wright Brothers travelled this way from Dayton to
turn bicycles into flying machines, the Outer Banks wasn't
much different than the rest of the area, it simply faced
the Atlantic Ocean instead of a creek or the Pamlico Sound.
It's mostly scrub pine and dunes, all feeling (quite
justifiably) like a good wind could blow it all away rather
quickly.  There is substantially more to blow away now than
there was then.  Those same cottages that line the ocean
beach in Virginia Beach also form a queue along the
shoreline here.  So do small cinder-block motels, and tall
name-brand hotels, small mom-and-pop grocery stores, and big
state-of-the-art strip shopping centers.  That wind is also
the fear many of the people who live here have, and why the
threat of a hurricane sends many of them miles inland when
one approaches, almost annually.  Of course, it was the wind
that brought the brothers to North Carolina in the first
place.  It's usually gentle, but constant.  On this day, it
was neither.  Each new detonation blew the dingy clouds at a
good clip out over the ocean.  It was unusually chilly, with
the threat of another downpour at any moment.  It was
Tuesday, and had been raining off and on since mid-day
Sunday.  The signs along the highway warned of stretches
with water over the roadway.

The Pamlico Sound stretches all the way back up to Virginia,
a straight shot by water, or up the banks by land, but
either route is blocked by the Back Bay National Wildlife
Refuge, and a state park.  You can go into, but not through
that area back into Virginia, unless you have a permit.
Those permits are jealously guarded by the Virginia
Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, and the U-S
Department of Interior.  The officers of both agencies
patrol the dirt roads through their domains.  If you've got
a permit, it cuts the trip by more than half.  The rest of
us endure the haul through the country, where among the
locals, the word "shit" grows to six syllables.

Maggie's funeral was scheduled for a small chapel at the
south end of Kill Devil Hills, as far south on the Outer
Banks as one can go without heading for Hatteras.  With the
rain still falling every now and then, my progress down the
highway was not delayed considerably by the tourists who
flock to this area this time of year.  I was early.  They
were holed up in the stilted cottages, playing gin rummy,
waiting out the weather.  In the winter, the area's
population can almost be counted on both hands and feet; on
a sunny summer day, there's gridlock on the pair of two-lane
highways that span the north-south length of the Banks.  I
had already made arrangements at a nearby hotel for an
overnight stay after the service.

Like most of the newer permanent-looking structures in the
area, the Morehouse Funeral Chapel was a brick and vinyl-
sided building, red brick below white siding.  Perhaps
because of the progress I had made on highway, I was one of
the first to arrive.  I parked the Ford in the scrabbly
oyster-shell lot, and walked into the building.

The funeral director - I guessed he was the owner of the
establishment -  was a short, stubby, balding man in an ill-
fitting, shiny blue suit.  He stood by the front door, and
spoke in the soft, soothing, perpetually eternal, always
very personal voice men of his profession cultivate.

"Hello, mister..."

I stuck out my hand.  "Streeter.  Bradford Streeter.  I'm
here for the Margaret Whitehurst funeral."  He ignored the
offer to shake hands.

"Of course.  What a tragedy."

"Yes, a shock."

"...a young woman from people like that, with everything
they have going for them.  I simply cannot understand what
would cause a woman like that to...well, to..."

"Kill herself?"

"Well, yes.  With so much to live for."

"Obviously, mister...Morehouse?"

"Yes.  Ronald.  Ronald Morehouse."  He offered his hand.  I
had given up, so I ignored it, wondering where it had been
lately.

"Obviously, mister Morehouse, Maggie did not agree with your
assessment of her assets."  I did not mean it sarcastically,
simply as a statement of fact.

His smile was strained, but properly noncommittal.  The last
thing he wanted was a discussion like this one was quickly
turning into, talking about the reasons people voluntarily
end up as his customers.  So I obliged, and steered the
conversation away from the direction it was headed.  "Do you
know Maggie's family well?"  For all the time the four of us
spent down here on one lark or another, we had never visited
them, had never stopped by for dinner, coffee, or even to
say hello.  Nor had Maggie spoken much about them, save for
her mother, who was dead.  Her father had remarried, and I
knew she had a sister named Madeline.

Mister Morehouse's eyes brightened, and he jumped at the
opportunity to gossip a little.  "Most people here do.  I
went to school with Margaret's father, Samuel, both here,
for high school, and at Chapel Hill, at college.  The
Leonard family has lived in Pamlico County since, well,
since before the War Between the States.  In banking, most
of them, with the exception of one or two.  Sam Leonard is
the president of the big bank in the county, over in Manteo.
He's on the school board, and heads up the planning
commission, too, in Tuttle, where the farm is."

"Then you knew Maggie?"

"Oh, my heavens, yes.  Both she and her sister.  Went to the
same church, Pamlico First Baptist."  He smiled.  "Sweet
little girls, both of them.  Well-behaved, beautiful
children.  Little angels.  It was a real tragedy when their
mother died."

"That would have been..." I was sandbagging.

"Roberta.  Roberta Bass Leonard.  Oh my, I remember when she
and Sam were married.  It was still the biggest wedding I've
ever seen.  Miss Roberta was from Raleigh, Sam met her up at
school.  She ended up involved in most everything.  The
library board, ladies' church group, the Youth Fellowship,
and the Girl Scouts.  She loved those little girls to
death."

"Maggie certainly thought highly of her mother.  She was
killed in an automobile accident, correct?  I think I
remember Maggie mentioned that."

"Yes.  The girls were...let's see.  Margaret was about
twelve, and that would have made Madeline about ten.
Terrible thing.  Miss Roberta just lost control of the car
somehow on a rainy night on her way inland back to the farm
after a church dinner.  It was between Manteo and Tuttle.
Ran off into the woods, and hit a big oak."

"Must have been tough on the whole family," I said.

Morehouse winced, and nodded his head.  "Just about killed
old Sam.  He was all weepy for about two years after the
accident.  Until he noticed Teresa."

"Maggie's Stepmother," I said.

"Yes, she was Sam's secretary at the bank.  Put new life in
him, that's for sure.  Took him in tow.  Didn't give him
enough time to feel sorry for himself.  Teresa was a young
thing, pretty as a picture.  She was only twenty-four when
she married Sam."

"Strike it rich?"

"You mean was she after his money?  Well, maybe at first,
but by the time she married him, I think she'd changed her
mind about that.  Sam was pretty well into wallowing around
in his sorrows.  I think Teresa looked at it as a challenge,
to bring him back to life."  The old man frowned in thought,
choosing his words carefully, then spoke slowly.  "She
married upward, but she grew into it pretty well.  She's no
Miss Roberta, but she's done pretty well in fitting in where
she can.  Keeps Sam out of trouble."

"What kind of trouble?"

He smiled, only slightly.  "Most all kinds," he said.  His
tone left no doubt that the conversation was over.  "Would
you like to view the departed before the service begins?
I've got to take care of some other details.  He opened a
door to an office, and called to a younger man.  "Ronnie,"
he said, "Come watch the door while I make some phone
calls."  He pointed down a short hallway to what looked like
two chapel rooms.  A younger version of Mister Morehouse,
with a little better head of hair, took his place by the
door to greet the public.

I walked into the "viewing room".  Maggie's coffin, open,
stood in front of blue curtains trimmed in black.  A copper-
colored lamp stood at either end of the coffin.  About forty
chairs were arranged in the room, four rows of five on
either side of a center aisle.  A small podium was to the
left of the coffin.  The floral blanket read, "Daughter".  A
few other standard-issue funeral arrangements were spread
around the floor, on stands nearby, and around the sides of
the room.  An elderly couple sat in the second row on the
right.  They both watched me as I entered, and walked up to
the side of the casket.

I am never prepared to "view the departed".  I think "stare
at the corpse" is perhaps a better phrase.  It's one of the
more deranged rituals of life we put ourselves through, or
that others choose to put us through.  I, however, am a man
who does what's expected, so I walked over to the casket to
say goodbye to Maggie, and stood, hands clasped behind my
back, looking down at her.

She was not a small woman, but she looked small lying there
in a box.  Five foot six, maybe.  Better than average looks,
but not drop-dead beautiful.  On a street, in a supermarket,
most men would not give her a second look.  Not until she
turned her full attention on you.  Then, you noticed the
shine in her very, very green eyes, the way the light
reflected off that auburn-colored hair.  She most often wore
it pulled back, in a pony tail, a french braid, or
something.  You imagined it down, down to her shoulders,
because that's how long it was.  When you spoke, her eyes
never left yours, she hung on every word, and touched you
when she made a point.  That's what you remembered most.
The touch, the touch that said for that one fleeting moment,
you were someone special.

It was that touch that made you, in solitary intervals,
remember the shape of her legs, her lips.  Well, hey.  I'm
not talking about you, I'm talking about me.  I'm talking
about what happened to me when I was around Maggie
Whitehurst.  I will not flatter myself to think that she was
as intrigued with me as I was with her, except perhaps for a
short time.

I was not used to seeing her dressed as she was today, like
this, in a plain blue business suit, with a high-necked
blouse, no doubt to cover the rope burns on her neck, and
who knows what they did at the morgue.  Her hair, though,
was every bit as beautiful down as I remembered seeing it on
those few occasions.  She made a good-looking corpse, but
the problem was, she looked dead.  No matter how good the
job the embalmer does, how "lifelike" the corpse looks, it's
still a corpse.  Whatever life was in that vessel has indeed
"departed", perhaps gone to another, depending on your
spiritual view, but certainly gone from this life forever.

I would have preferred to have remembered Maggie differently
than this.  She had her faults, but she was as full of life
and honesty as any person I have known, or am likely to
know.

Our affair had started as one of those couples trips, in
fact, the last one the four of us ever took, late last
summer.  We went to the Outer Banks often over the years we
had known each other, renting a cottage for a weekend, or
sometimes a week.  This time, it was a week-long trip after
Labor Day, after the rental rates dropped.  The cottage was
a good one, an expensive one, a modern one, two stories, all
light woods, formica, chrome and glass.  It went for
thirteen hundred dollars per week during the season.  This
particular week, the rate was four hundred dollars.  A white
gazebo atop a dune overlooked the Atlantic.  We arrived on
Friday night, with enough time to unpack and cook dinner on
the barbecue, and take a little walk on the beach before
turning in.

All the next day, Saturday, we had done the usual things,
spent a little quiet time after breakfast, visited some of
the shops along what passes for the waterfront strip, even
visited the Wright Brothers Museum for the third or fourth
time.  We saw a movie, ate dinner at one of the better
restaurants, and went back to the cottage, all of us a
little tipsy.  Barbara and I had a good time, I think.  At
least I did.  We did not act like husband and wife toward
each other, we acted as friends.  I knew our marriage was in
trouble, and had been for some time.  It was The Thing we
didn't talk about, the big elephant in the living room that
you put a doily and a vase of flowers on, make it look like
it belongs, like it's part of the furniture, but no one ever
says,  says, "What the hell is a fucking elephant doing in
the living room?"

There was always a certain amount of sexual tension involved
in these foursome outings, working at a very low, almost
subconscious, level.  Sometimes, we would swap spouses for
shopping trips, museum visits, or even an occasional movie
that the odd couple wanted to see.  Sometimes, Maggie and I
found ourselves holding hands as we walked along the beach,
or in the theatre.  I know Bobby and Barbara did the same.
We had never acted on any of this, except to speculate once
or twice about what the neighbors might think if they saw us
paired off this way.  It was, at the most, titillating,
flirtatious, and fun.  The fact that any one of us could be
a little excited by holding the opposite's spouse...I always
found slightly amusing.

I honestly did not know that Bobby and Maggie's marriage was
in trouble, as well.  I thought I sensed some distance, some
withdrawal on the part of one or both of them, but I figured
I was probably projecting some of my own problems on them.
So I filed it away.  Barbara and I had our own things to
deal with, or I had to deal with what our situation was
becoming, perhaps a friendly disengagement, but a pending
parting of the ways, nonetheless.

That night, after falling asleep in bed next to Barbara, I
dreamed of reaching out, waking her, and telling her gently
that she was my friend, and that I recognized her pain.
That if being with someone else, or simply being away from
me would relieve that pain, I would do what I could to help.
I just needed a sign from her that it was all right, that a
separation would be a good thing, a comfortable thing, that
it would relieve what I was feeling, too.  I was not at all
sure that would be the case.  If, as my friend, she could
reassure me about it all, it might be a bit easier.  I
awakened damp with perspiration, and a bit frightened.

So restless, I had decided to walk up to the gazebo, have a
smoke, and stare out at the ocean for a while.  The gazebo
was about a hundred feet from the beach, and the roar of the
surf was deafening.  In supposing I would be unnoticed,
either by Barbara, or by Bobby or Maggie, though, I was only
partially right.  Maggie found me.  Lost in my own thoughts,
she sneaked right up.

"What are you doing out here?" she shouted.

I turned with a start. "Having a smoke, clearing out my
head."  We were both yelling over the insistent rush of the
surf.

"But not your lungs, huh?"  She laughed, and moved closer.
I was the only one of the four of us who smoked.  It was a
constant source of needling from Maggie.

I shrugged.  "Everyone has an addiction or two.  I'm just
happy mine isn't for cute ten-year-old boys."

She gave a impish grin, and a sly wink.  "Won't Barbara miss
you?  Aren't you two doing what people come down here for?
A little romance?  A little heavy breathing?"

I took another drag of the cigarette, and exhaled heavily.
"Not this time, Maggie.  It hasn't been that way for a
while."

"I know.  Me neither," She said.  The silly, mocking tone
disappeared quickly, and she turned to stare out at the
ocean, the waves breaking endlessly upon the beach.

"Maggie," I said, "you go through cycles in a marriage.  Up
a little, down a little.  Does it all average out?  It was
the argument I'd given Barbara.  If not me, who?  If not
Barbara, who?  Who would love me?  Who would care about me?
Why could I not bring myself to face facts?  I threw the
cigarette butt down in mild disgust, and stepped on it.

Maggie kept staring out at the ocean for a few more seconds,
before she turned, and touched my arm.  That touch.  "Not
this time, Brad.  I think Bobby and I have pretty well
bottomed out.  Bobby keeps looking for the 'big score', the
deal that's going to get us out of debt, let us...let
him...feel comfortable enough to start a family, to get on
to where we need to be, something more.  He says he keeps
looking for it, he promises he'll keep looking, but I'm sure
he's not convinced it's what he wants.  He's comfortable in
getting by, keeping the bills paid.  He doesn't want to get
ahead.  I'm tired of treading water, Brad.  If you don't
move ahead, you sink.  I'm sinking."  She squeezed my arm
for emphasis.  "I can feel it.  Unless I get out of this
marriage and move ahead, I'm going down for the third time.
I can't do that.  I won't do that.  How about you and
Barbara?" she asked, an eyebrow raised.  "Are you going to
give it a 'little time'?"

"I'm a patient guy.  But you know Barbara better than me," I
said.  "You two shop, and lunch, and do all that female
bonding stuff.  You tell me.  Tell me the truth."

"You don't want the truth, Brad.  You're too busy being
patient, and good, and kind, and it's not what you are at
all.  You're too busy working at being the good guy.  You're
too busy trying to be the one who's right, the wronged man,
the stoic figure who can hold his head up high, beat on his
chest, and say 'this marriage didn't fail because of me!  I
did nothing to bring this upon myself!'  You're so busy
working on that, because you've given up on the
relationship.  You're already working on how you'll see
yourself after it breaks apart. You want the truth?  Okay,
the truth is maybe you could have saved it.  Just maybe
Barbara wouldn't have drifted away if you had spent a little
more time on the relationship, instead of working fourteen-
hour days.  Maybe Barbara didn't care if you were a big-
time, high-paid network correspondent by the time you were
forty, like you did.  Maybe, just maybe, Barbara wants a
full-time husband, who hangs out around the house, fixes the
busted faucet, and makes babies with her.  The truth is that
you don't have any time left.  She's going to pull the plug,
Brad.  She's waiting for the right time, but she's going to
pull the plug, you big jerk, and you know it.  It's not if
anymore.  It's when.  You're a nice guy, and she doesn't
want to hit you while you're down, but it's coming.  Not
tomorrow, not the next day, but soon."

I snapped at her.  "You're full of shit."  Of course, she
was right, not only right, but it was a direct hit.  Mine
was only what the military people call a secondary
explosion, but that was about all I could think of to say at
the time.  Denial may not be a good thing, but it has its
handy uses.

Maggie moved closer to me, and put her arm around my waist.
I could smell the citrus of her perfume, even above the
wind.  Instinctively, I pulled her closer, turned her to
face me, and put both arms around her.

"The truth," she said, "is that you are a nice guy, and not
at all stupid about what's going on."  Another squeeze.
"And the truth is that I wish I had you, your drive, where
you will be some day, and that Barbara had Bobby."  She
buried her head into my neck, sighed, and shuddered a
little.  "It sure would make a lot more sense that way."

We held each other for a very long time, just standing there
in the gazebo, holding on.  What happened that night,
between the two of us, was really irrelevant to what was
about to happen to the four of us.  Whether we made love, or
not, the fates of our respective marriages were already in
the cards, and we all knew what they were.  Maggie and I
were simply fellow travelers on roads that converged for...a
short time?  I didn't know just then.  I did know that I had
thought about taking Maggie's hair down all night.  So I
did.

And so, after my separation from Barbara, Maggie and I
became lovers for a few months.  It would not last.  I knew
that then, but I let it happen anyway.  When a person's
world is falling apart, as I felt mine was at the time, that
person will grab on to anything, using Maggie's metaphor, to
keep from going down that third time.

Maggie spoke the last words either of us said that night.

"Hold on," she said.  "It's going to be a bumpy ride."

                            III

I would have liked to have thought my relationship with
Maggie broke faith with no one.  But certainly, Bobby would
have felt betrayed, had he known.  I was still not sure he
didn't know about it.

Barbara broke the news on a Sunday night in August, while we
watched the late news.  Usually the paragon of fashion, even
in leisure, she had been moping around all weekend in a
sweat shirt and ratty shorts, speaking in monosyllables, and
saying over and over again she didn't feel well.

I said, "Are you feeling better?"

She said, "No."

I said, "Still feeling lousy?"

She said, "Yes."

I said, "Is something wrong besides feeling lousy?"

She said, "Yes.  I want a divorce."

Well, hey.  I was the one who asked.  I did not sleep well
that night.  Barbara slept on the couch, I guess.  I packed
and moved on Monday, first into a hotel on the strip, then
into the duplex above Wesley on the weekend.  I got an
attorney, signed the separation agreement, and sulked for
two months.  I worked a lot, putting in sixty, seventy hour
weeks, volunteering for all the overtime I could get at the
television station.  I sifted through records at
courthouses, drove to Richmond once or twice, and broke
several big stories about corruption and crime.  When it
feels like someone has taken your world, turned it upside
down and shaken it, it's comforting to have something
familiar to turn to.  For me, it was my work.  It always had
been.  It was one of the problems, according to Barbara.

Anyway, after a couple of months of pouting, I was at the
mall one Friday night, aimlessly shopping, wondering if
spending money would make me feel better, watching people,
and still pouting, when I ran into Bobby and Barbara.  We
made small talk.  Funny how you can share the most intimate
things as couples, but feel awkward when one of the four
wheels falls off.

I caught them up on "what I was doing with myself", looked
at my watch, and ducked into a movie theatre quickly, to see
a picture I cared nothing about, just to get out of the
awkwardness of the situation.

The next afternoon, I fell asleep with a beer on the couch
while watching a football game I cared nothing about.  There
was a knock at the sliding glass door that awakened me.  I
looked at the clock.  It was about six.  I opened the
curtains, and there stood Maggie on the deck, almost
silhouetted against the purple fall sky, wearing a denim
jacket, a plaid flannel shirt, and white twill slacks.  The
breeze off the bay was chilly with the sun down, and blew
her hair around her neck.

"Where's Bobby?"  I asked.

"Gone to Charlottesville for the football game," she said.
"He's getting drunk with the good old boys.  He'll be
driving back in the morning."

"Where are you?"  I asked.

"Here."  Nothing ruins a rhetorical question like a literal
answer.  "Will you do me a favor?" she asked.

"Sure.  What?"

"Kiss me.  Hold me.  Make love to me."

I stepped out onto the deck, and took her into my arms.  We
kissed, and then I took her hand and led her to my bedroom.

                            -0-

"Isn't this where we're supposed to say, '...gee, she looks
so life-like,' or something?"

I turned toward the voice, and looked into Maggie's green
eyes.  Same hair, same mouth, same green eyes.  Younger, but
not by much.  A little hipper-looking.  "Hello, Madeline,
Brad Streeter," I said, offering my hand.  "Sorry to trash
the script, but she doesn't look too life-like to me.  She
looks dead."

"Yep.  Dead," the woman said.  She took my hand in a firm
grip.  "Friends call me Mary.  Mary Leonard.  Sister of the
deceased."  She winced.  "Sorry about that crack.  I'm not
sure I know how to act at these things."

I nodded.  "Death affects people in different ways."

I looked around the chapel.  It was filling rapidly.  Not a
big crowd by my standards, but probably large enough for
Tuttle, North Carolina.

Mary was wearing a black dress, knee-length, fairly plain,
but elegant.  What you would call a cocktail dress, I guess,
under other circumstances, but suitable for mourning.

"You were Bobby and Maggie's neighbor, right?"

"Yes."

"Are you the one she had the affair with before she and
Bobby split?"

A direct question deserves a direct answer.  When in doubt,
tell the truth.  "Yes," I said.

"Want to sit?"

"Okay."  She led the way to the back of the folding chairs.
We sat in silence, although I have to admit I took a good
look at her once or twice.  The resemblance was striking.

Barbara joined the party just as the organ music began.

She looked better than I had seen her in some time.  Of
course, I had not seen her at all for about six months or
so, since the hearing to finalize the divorce.  She nodded,
and mouthed "Hello" as she walked to the front.  She was
wearing a navy suit, with a white blouse, dark stockings and
black pumps.  She had let her hair grow, and had darkened
the color.  It had always looked sort of dishwater blonde.
Now it looked a pleasant light shade of brown.

I thumbed through the program for the funeral.  The Reverend
M. Scott Thomas would be presiding, with Jessica Copal at
the keyboard.  Bobby arrived in a three-piece suit, followed
by a gray-haired man, with what I was learning were Leonard
eyes, immaculately dressed in a pinstriped number, and a
much younger blonde woman in a black dress.  I assumed they
were Maggie's father and stepmother.  Ms. Copal launched
into "Amazing Grace", a few moments later, the Reverend
Thomas appeared from behind the blue curtain.

Mary Leonard looked at me, and at eyebrow went up.
"Showtime," she said.

Bobby sat in the front row, next to Barbara, on one side of
the aisle, old man Leonard and the woman on the other.  One
glance between Bobby and the Sam Leonard said it all.  Mary
Leonard said no more.

                               -0-

Jessica Copal was competent at the keyboard, but the good
reverend Thomas was boring as hell.  It became immediately
obvious that he had never met Maggie, Bobby, maybe not even
old Sam Leonard.  The only thing he got right was what a
waste it all seemed.

Bobby and Sam Leonard were still glaring at each other when
they and four other men loaded Maggie up into the hearse.
The rain had stopped for now, but it looked as if it could
start up again anytime.  The wind was still blowing pretty
strong.  I was getting into my car when Mary Leonard trotted
over to the passenger's side, and put her hand on the
handle.

"Mind if I ride with you?"

"No problem," I said.  "I kind of figured you'd be riding
with your father, though."

"He's got whatshername to ride with."

"Right.  Whatever."  I crossed over to her side of the car
and opened the door.

The two Mister Morehouses, Senior and Junior, handed out the
little magnetic flags to put on our cars, and reminded us to
turn on our headlights for the trip to the cemetery.  A gray
police cruiser sat in front of the hearse.  Ronald Senior
said we'd be going to the family burial plot, off a main
road near the Leonard Farm, that we'd be running stop signs
and traffic signals, and to stay close to the car ahead.

Mary and I rode in silence for the first couple of miles
through farmland.  I felt compelled to make pleasant
conversation.  When you don't know what to talk about, talk
about the other person.

"Maggie didn't talk about her family much," I said, hoping
that didn't sound like some kind of judgment.

"She hadn't been close to any of us for some time," Mary
said.  She continued to stare out the window.

"What I mean is," I said, "I don't know much about your
family.  Mister Morehouse said your father is a banker."

"That's right," she said.  "He's got more money than you can
imagine."

I smiled, a little.  "I can imagine quite a bit."

"Well," she said, "He's got more than I can imagine, or most
of the folks around here can imagine."

"What do you do?"  I asked.

"A little of this, and a little of that," she said.  "Right
now, I'm working at a dress shop at one of the hotels."

                               -0-


"It was awful," she said finally, pulling a cigarette from
her purse, Marlboro, if it matters, and lighting it with one
of those slender little precious metal lighters with the
little roller-thing on the side.  Almost startled, she
looked at me quickly.  "Is this alright?  Smoking in your
car, I mean."

"Yes," I said, and fished a Salem out of my sport coat and
lit it with my Bic.  "You mean Saturday," I said.

"Yes.  Daddy called me at about two Sunday morning.  I mean,
I knew she'd been depressed, but I didn't think she'd do
something like this.  I still have a hard time believing
she's gone."

"You two were close?"  I asked.

"Not exactly.  But we'd gotten closer since she'd come
down."

"How long had she been down here?" I asked.

"About six weeks.  She was still making trips to Virginia
Beach to see a therapist, and I really thought she had been
making some progress.  She talked about the future, what she
wanted to do after the divorce was final."  She shook her
head.  "Did you know she wanted to paint?"

"No, but I knew she had some talent in that direction."

"She wanted to paint."  Mary Leonard was crying, watching
the tobacco fields go by.

At the cemetery, it was the standard stuff.  Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.  The Reverend Thomas' standard protestant
graveside speech.  I kept hoping it wouldn't begin raining
again.  After the final "amen", Mary plucked a rose from one
of the wreaths, and the workmen began cranking the coffin
into the ground.

Barbara, who pretty much had ignored me up until now, walked
over to where I stood with Mary.

"Mary Leonard, my ex-wife Barbara.  Barbara...Mary."

Barbara said to Mary, "I was saddened to hear about your
sister's death.  As I'm sure Brad has told you, we were very
close with Maggie and Bobby."

"Yes," Mary said.  "Very close.  Excuse me, please.  I've
got to speak with some friends."  Tight smile, and poof.
Gone.

Barbara turned to me.  "How have you been doing, Brad?"

"Unemployed, but well.  You?"

"I read about your loss in the paper.  I'm sorry, Brad.  I
know your job meant a lot to you.  I've been well.  I'm
studying for a real estate license."

"Not great lately, but not a bad business to be into around
Virginia Beach," I said.  "Was the split between Maggie and
Bobby nasty?"

"Not really, she just packed up the car, and left one
afternoon.  She waited for Bobby to get home, and told him
she needed to get away for a while."

"Her sister said she was still seeing a therapist at the
Beach."

"I think so, but to tell you the truth, we haven't talked
much since...since you moved out and all."

"Yeah, I know how it goes."  I couldn't help but wonder how
much Barbara really knew about what had happened between
Maggie and me.

The crowd was thinning quickly.  Probably the weather.  I
offered to buy Barbara dinner.  She politely declined.  Mary
Leonard had vanished.  I watched Barbara get into the big
Mercury alone, and drive away.  Even the Reverend Thomas had
split.  It was me, the old couple, and the two cemetery
workers, who were just starting to fire up the backhoe a few
yards away.  It was close to five o'clock.  I walked over to
the Mustang, and drove away.

Seven-Elevens grow like weeds in this part of the world.  If
it looks like any development is coming soon anywhere, the
Southland Corporation cranks all the numbers into its
massive mainframe computer somewhere and decides it's time
for another Seven-Eleven, or maybe two or three.  In some
suburban areas, they're built right across the street from
one another, so that you don't have to make a left turn to
pick up the bread and milk on the way home.  Left turns are
bad for business.  As I approached civilization and the
hotel, I pulled into one and picked up a cold six of
Stroh's.  Better than paying ten bucks for it at the Armada.
I parked the Mustang, and threw my sport coat in the back
seat, along with my shoes and socks.  I rolled up my
pantlegs, popped the top on a cold one, stuck another in my
pocket, and walked down the beach.

I don't know how far I walked, maybe five miles, or maybe it
seemed like five miles.  It was one beer's worth.  I walked
to where the hotels stop, and the beach houses begin.  I sat
on the beach, and stared out at the surf for a good long
time.  I finished the first beer, dropped the can into a
barrel, and opened the second.  It was warm.  There were
dynamics at work here that I didn't understand.  Bobby and
Sam Leonard.  Maggie and Mary.  Maggie and Mary and their
stepmother.

I told myself it was none of my business.  I told myself the
relationship with Maggie, whatever it had been, had been
over long before she had made the decision to leave this
world.  Maggie did not love me, did not know me well enough
to love me, or me her.  But it hadn't been that long.  And I
had to admit that whatever misguided feelings I had about
love, I had felt as if I loved Maggie.  Or could love her.
Or wanted to love her.  Or something.  Whatever it was, it
hurt.  So I cried the tears of loss, and pain, and a little
guilt, too.   For what might have been with Maggie, and with
Barbara, and with the other women I had known in my
lifetime.  The sky was beginning to clear.  I walked back to
the car as I finished the second beer, and grabbed my coat
and the remaining four-pack out of the back seat.  When I
got back to the room, I put the beer on ice in the sink and
took a long, hot shower.  I shaved, dressed in white slacks
and a polo shirt, and went downstairs for dinner.  It was
about eight-thirty.

                            -0-

As I passed the bar headed for the dining room, it was the
same hoarse, rough sounding voice from the funeral home.

"Hey, Streeter."  Mary Leonard was positioned at the end of
the bar, with a view of the entry into the dining room.  She
still wore the black dress from this afternoon, but she
didn't look like she was mourning anymore, it really looked
like a cocktail dress.  She was sitting with legs crossed,
smoking a cigarette.  An empty glass stood on the bar.

"Hello, Mary," I said.  "Buy you a drink?"

"How about a drink and dinner?"  She arched one eyebrow.

"Okay."

She picked up her purse, and we went into the dining room.
I followed, and noticed that Mary had not only the same
coloring, but much the same shape as her sister.  Where
Maggie was soft, however, there seemed to be just a little
bit of an edge about Mary.  She may have been Maggie's
younger sister, but she looked just a little older, a little
more worldly, if that makes any sense.  We were seated at a
table near the window.  The dark clouds still hung over the
ocean to the east, but it was obviously clearing to the
west, because the setting sun outlined long shadows in
orange across the beach.  Mary ordered another drink, a
vodka tonic.  I ordered another beer, Stroh's if they had
it, Bud if they didn't.  The waiter said he'd be right back
with a Bud.

"The service was nice," she said, while we waited for our
drinks.  "The day turned out nice, at least."  She was
looking out at the ocean.

"I got the impression that the minister didn't know Maggie
well,"  I said.

"Not since we were kids."

"Well, you're right.  It was a nice service."  A brief lull,
as both of stared out at the ocean.  "Does your father get
along with Bobby?"

"Daddy doesn't get along with much of anyone," she said as
the drinks arrived.  The waiter placed them atop the
obligatory napkins, and departed.  "Especially Bobby," she
said.

"Do you know why?"

"Bobby was a little older than Maggie.  Daddy was always
real protective of the two of us.  Didn't want us to go on
dates until we were sixteen, and didn't really want us to do
it then, either, but you can't exactly tell a sixteen year
old girl not to go on dates, for Christ's sake.  So Daddy's
little girls were growing up, and Daddy didn't like it one
little bit.  I would hear them fighting when she came home
late from her dates.  I could hear him yelling at the boys
out in the driveway, and I could hear him yelling at Maggie
downstairs after they left."  Mary took a large swallow of
the vodka tonic.  "He called her things like 'slut' and
'whore', and wanted to know every little detail of every
date."

"Was your stepmother much help?"

"No.  I always felt like she married Daddy for the money.
She treated us alright, she never hurt us much, but she
wouldn't stick up for us like Mother.  Still doesn't, much.
Mostly when Daddy got into one of his moods like that, she'd
just leave the room and go upstairs and take a sleeping
pill.  Teresa just doesn't care about us much one way or
another.  Well, I mean, didn't...I mean..."  Her voice was
quivering a little.  "God, she's really dead.  Maggie's
really dead, just like Daddy said."  She stared out the
window for a couple of seconds, then polished off the drink.

"Do you want to order?"  I asked.

"Order me another drink, please," she said, putting the
glass back on the napkin.  "And I'll look at the menu after
I get back from powdering my nose, having a good cry, and
blotting up the mess."  She rose quickly, and left.

I motioned to the waiter, and ordered another drink for
Mary.  I'd pass this round.  The eastern sky was dark now,
and I could see the lights of the ships running up and down
the coast.  Coal carriers, mostly, taking Virginia coal to
South America.  I was attracted to Mary.  She had a sharp
tongue and a quick wit.  Was it that, or the fact that she
resembled Maggie a lot?  Was I attracted to Mary, or Maggie
all over again, or just any woman?  How well did I know
Maggie?  How well had I known any of the women who had been
in my life, including my wife?

Doctor Al Avery, my shrink, says I should ask myself
questions like this.  Well, he doesn't exactly say it,
rather, he asks questions like this, and expects me, by
osmosis, to ask them to myself.  I'm never sure if they're
real questions, or rhetorical ones.  Shrinks never tell you
what to do, they simply ask questions that lead you to
believe they're telling you what to do.  "Are you saying I
should think about this more?" I say.  "What do you think
about that?" he replies.  This type of behavior is known as
"analyzing the analyst", and is frowned upon by virtually
the entire analyzing community.  But then, we were talking
about me, and not them.  Go figure.

Mary returned, cigarette in hand, and plopped down with a
great exhalation of air.

"Well," she said, "I'm glad that's over with.  I'd been
wondering when the good cry was going to come."

"Feel better?"  I asked.

"For now.  Probably not for long."

The waiter returned to take our order.  I ordered a steak,
medium rare, while Mary perused the menu.  She ordered
stuffed flounder.  The waiter nodded his approval, clicked
his ballpoint, offered me another beer, which I declined,
and left.

"So why did Maggie move back here?"  I asked.  "Why not move
in with you, or with some friends, or out on her own?"

"She was going to move in with me," Mary said.  "Or that's
what she told me.  But she said there were some things she
had to do first."

"If the relationship with your father wasn't good, moving to
the farm couldn't have been much fun," I said.

"I don't think it was.  Daddy didn't really want to take her
back, but Teresa talked him into it."

"Teresa talked him into it?  Your stepmother?"

"Yeah."

"Why?"

"I don't exactly know," she said.  "Maybe she wanted to make
up for not being there before."

"Before when?"

"When daddy cut Maggie off and kicked her out.  I mean, she
was ready to move out and tell him to stuff it anyway.  But
she moved up to Williamsburg, and started going to William
and Mary studying art, and she got involved with some boy up
there.  Brian something was his name.  Daddy didn't like it,
so when he got her grades, and they weren't what he thought
they should have been, he cut off her money, and told her
not to bother coming home."

"What did she do then?"

"Got a job as a legal secretary, and met Bobby at a real
estate closing.  He was sweet, and polite, and romantic.  He
treated her real nice at the time, took her places, sent her
flowers, and all that shit."

I had heard the story of how they met, but I didn't know the
background.  The waiter served salad.

"Daddy got real mad.  See, he wanted her to come crawling
and begging back home, saying she was sorry for how much
she'd screwed up her life, and would he please take her
back, and how she'd be a good girl and all that crap,"  Mary
said.  "She didn't do it.  She got a job, trained herself,
really, found a guy and married him real quick, just to have
someone to take care of her.  And Bobby's real sweet, but
he's sort of a...Bubba, you know?  Like there's all these
guys who go out and drink beer on Saturdays, and watch
football games, and do all that guy stuff?  And about every
other one of them is nicknamed 'Bubba'?  Well, Bobby is a
'Bubba', whether that's his nickname or not.  He's just a
good ole boy lawyer, looking for the big score that will
keep him in Budweiser and big screen, satellite dish
football games for life.  And fishing, of course.  And
Maggie finally decided she wanted more.  She thought she
deserved more, so she left him.  She was going to figure out
a way to go back to school.  She was going to get a job
here, and start going back to the community college, then
transfer the credits back to William and Mary, or NC State,
or somewhere else."

"I didn't know she was that unhappy with Bobby," I said.

"Bobby's a real hard guy to get mad at," she said.  "He's
just so darned...amiable, is that the word?"

"Yes."

"Oh, good."  The waiter appeared with our meals, and made
the appropriate little flourishes as he put them in front of
us.  Mary stubbed out her cigarette.  "Bobby is a nice guy,
just not very ambitious, or romantic, or loving, or
intimate.  Maggie was his wife, and he expected to keep the
house, look good at parties, and give him a little roll in
the hay once or twice a week.  She got tired of it."

Maggie didn't talk about your father much.  Or you, either,
for that matter."

"That's not surprising.  We weren't very close for a long
time.  At least not until recently."  The liquor was
beginning to catch up with her.  'Recently' came out 're-
schent-lee'.  She finished up the glass.

"That's what you said.  Things got better when Maggie moved
back?"

"Yes.  She said she was going to move in with me, like I
told you.  We were going to be roommates."  The word "told"
came out "tole".

"Really?"

"Yes, but then she went and killed herself.  But enough
about me and my dead sister.  Let's talk about you and my
dead sister."  Mary was now more than a little drunk.  "So
how was she in bed?  Maggie, that is."

I winced.  "Mary, I do not embarrass easily, but you're
testing the limits here.  Do you really expect me to answer
that question?"

"I suppose not.  She said you were pretty much a gentleman,
and that you didn't tell anyone.  She said you were..."  She
was groping for a word.

I helped her.  "Discreet."

"Yeah.  That's it.  Discreet."  It came out 'dish-kreet'.
Learn a new word every day.

"So you said you and Maggie were getting closer?" I asked.

She looked out the window at the ocean, then back at me.
"Let's say we had some things in common."

"Like what?"

"The men in our lives.  Or maybe I should say the man in our
lives."

I twirled the cocktail napkin I had been playing with.  "I
give up," I said.

She smiled a silly, drunken smile.  "Why, silly, Daddy, of
course.  He was screwing both of us when we were kids.
That's why she's dead.  She was going to confront him."

                       Dwarf Diaries
 
 
 
 
(A bit of history: During one of the big fluff battles, I think it was the
fight against Emperior, there was a prismatic dragon floating around.  It
acted like a prismatic sphere, sometimes throwing people into alternate
dimensions.  Logan, some kind of dwarf paladin I think, asked people to keep
an eye out for the dwarves who got thrown around.  Here's what happened to
five of them.)
 
Logan: I've got some very lost-looking dwarves here.  Lost isn't exactly the
  word for them. They were flung from a battlefield to the room in Tlau
  Talantlika where I keep my collection of more questionable magic objects.
  One of them, Gwolin, is a thief, and decided to plunder the room.
  He filled his pockets with a collection of very dangerous rings, and then
  climbed on a chair to get at a large box on a high shelf.  The chair-leg
  broke, and the bottles in the box went flying all over the room.  It
  happened to be a box full of changing powders.
 
  So, all five dwarves look rather odd at the moment.  Gwolin has clusters of
  clear tentacles where ordinary dwarves keep their arms and hair.  Blundir
  has immense blue ears and a six-foot long tongue, and it's a good thing he
  got the puffy-cheek powder too or he wouldn't be able to keep it in his
  mouth.  Oime's beard drips a sort of healing mead, and she burps bats, which
  she doesn't like at all.  Kjorn is a centaur-thing, half dwarf, half
  panther.  Kurad-nin got the worst of the lot: he's a bevy of (thirteen)
  nightingales, with his ordinary mind shared between them.
 
  They're the silliest hoard-robbers I've encountered in many a year, though
  among the most effective.  I was amused enough so that I didn't kill them;
  I just removed the rings from Gwolin's pockets, and had them amuse me from
  time to time.  I'm not expecting this world to last much longer (a glimpse
  into the mind of the Demiurge, who seems even more bloodthirsty than I am),
  so I'm moving my collections to somewhere safer, and I don't feel like
  moving the dwarves.
 
  I have no reason to be particulary fond of these dwarves.  I don't
  ordinarily get angry at uninvited guests, especially ones who were thrown
  here by accident.  I do ordinarily get quite angry at ones who try stealing
  from my collections.  They look funny, but they mostly sit around feeling
  sorry for themselves.  I had planned to leave them here to die or not with
  the world.  Oime is a good talker, even with a bat every few sentences, and
  somehow she persuaded me to send them offworld.  I will send them to Yest,
  which at least has mountains for them to play in.  Gwolin has helped
  himself rather liberally from the pile of things I had planned to leave
  behind, so I'm going to put an additional curse or two on them all; and
  further I give them this prophecy: they shall not be relieved of their
  body-changing curses until they come before me and amuse me properly.
 
  I'm leaving them one of the net.talkers, so that you can give them advice.
  Tell Gwolin to stop planning out loud to kill people when (1) they are
  immeasurably more powerful than he is, despite being smaller, and (2) they
  are around the corner, in earshot even without a dragon's hearing.
 
  (* To players: this is low-level fluff.  The dwarves are level 1-3.
  Treat them nicely, please. *)
 
Gwolin's Diary:
   October 19.  Oime somehow managed to persuade the dragon to let us go.  I
still want to attack it.  I'm sure we can kill it.  I told Oime that I'd
sneak up behind it and stab it with the glowing blue dagger I picked up while
it wasn't looking (it's gotta be a magic dagger!  I just know it!).  I'm sure
it could stab it through to the heart.  And even if I didn't, there are five
of us, and we're each a lot bigger than it (except maybe Kuraddy).  It can't
possibly be as dangerous as the prismatic crystal dragon was.  But Oime is a
coward.  She's afraid that it has more magic than her.  I told him that I've
got magic too, and not just this dagger.
   But Oime and Kjorn chickened out.  So the dragon drew this big circle in
the air and told us to walk through, and here we are in Bluggiville.
Bluggiville is not going to be my favorite city.  It's full of smelly humans,
and smellier goats.  And people keep *staring* at us.  I have to keep my
tentacles under my cloak all the time, and it's *hot*.  Kjorn is in even
worse shape.  They are making her stay in the barn.  Oh, I forgot.  We had to
try five inns before we found one that would take us.  Then we had a lot of
trouble with the money.  They don't like gold here.  They don't take
silver by weight.  We managed to change all our silver for circenes, and
there's enough for two or three days.  And these tentacles are really neat!
I cut a little slit in my cloak, and I took a fork off the next table without
anyone noticing!  OK, so it's only a fork.  Next time it'll be a purse or a
watch.
 
Blundir's diary:
  I hate this tongue.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Kjorn's diary:
 
Gwolin is a supreme blockhead, and will probably get us killed within the
week.  He walked in to an alchemist's shop, and offered the alchemist some
weird wand that he took from the dragon if the guy could brew him a potion to
send us back home.  So of course the alchemist took the wand, and played
around with some godawful herbs and metals and stuff.  He mixes and stirs and
boils for a while, chanting some kind of nonsense, and finally he comes up
with five little bottles of oily green gunk.  Well, we go back to the tavern
with our gunk, and eventually Blundir and Oime come back in and we're ready
to try the stuff.  Oime sniffs it, and she isn't so sure about it, and she
and Kurad-Nin and Gwolin argue about it for half an hour, and finally Gwolin
gets really pissed and chugs his bottle as if it were beer.
 
And he falls on the floor puking his stupid guts out.  Oime said that it was
not for the uninitiated to know what the gunk was (which means she doesn't
know), but it's pretty nasty poison.   Gwolin is a pretty tough cookie, so
he's still alive.  He's also pretty pissed.  If he were able to walk, he'd go
back and flame the alchemist's stop.  The dumb shit should have realized that
anyone in this city would give their teeth for that wand, whatever it does,
and that if he didn't know how to make the potion we wanted, he'd just make
us something so nasty we couldn't come back and take the wand from him.  The
idiot should have died.
 
Blundir's Diary:
 
  I stepped on my tongue twice this morning.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Blundir's diary:
  They made me take care of Gwolin.  I'm not having any fun here.  They got
  to go out and tell fortunes all day in the bazaar.  Three days in a row!
 
 
Gwolin's diary:
 
Lo!  No lout of an alchemist is able to defy *me*, Gwolin the Iron-Stomached,
son of Gwinlod who survived three drafts of Garnet's homemade beer, and
innumerable casks of Bjorkburp's special ale, grandson of Gwain stung by an
adder as a child, great-grandson of Gwarrow who wrestled the venomous toads
of Thistlejary.  And I have had my revenge, too, and twice over at that: and
so, ever, is it with those who seek to mess with Gwolin!
 
Last night, as soon as I was hale and sound, I did return to the shop of the
accursed alchemist Schamanu-Zor.  Locked and triple-locked, it was, but locks
cannot keep out the prince of thieves!  I soon found that a window was ajar,
and with three tentacles opened it.  Just then the Watch came to the shop,
for there was an alarm upon it, and they confronted me, demanding to know if
I was breaking into it.  I could feel the beady, cold gaze of a truthspell
upon me.  And so I answered "Breaking in?  Me?  How could I break in?  I
don't even have any arms!"  And they were properly ashamed, and left me in
peace.  No fool of the Watch shall catch Gwolin!  And I took nigh on two
hundred Circenes from Schamanu-Zor, and four potions, and a box of mixed
magic, and set fire to the rest for revenge.
 
Kjorn:
 
Gwolin is as stupid as a drunk badger.  Worse.  A drunk badger would go hide
in a hole and sleep it off.  Gwolin was seen by the watch messing with
Schamanu-Zor's shop, and took great pains to make himself recognizable -- how
many armless, hairless dwarven strangers are there in a town of humans?  Even
in the week with a fair?  We had to leave damn quickly when Gwolin got home
and told us what he did.  Even then we got caught: nobody but the innkeeper,
thinking we were skipping out on our last night's rent.  We had to pay him
triple -- out of Gwolin's newly-stuffed pocket, blessings to Durin.
Bluggiville wasn't such a bad place, either.  Oime and Kurad-Nin and I had a
nice little fortune-telling racket going, with Kurad-Nin flying all over
snooping, me in front to get attention, and Oime acting more Oime than usual,
burping bats and very accurate prophecies.  We got half a circene each, after
word got around.  When we get somewhere nice, we'll tie Blundir's tongue
around Gwolin's neck and then maybe he'll stay put.
 
 
Gwolin's Diary: (Saturday)
 
I do not believe these people!  Here I go earn more money in one night than
all of them together did in a week, and not only don't they thank me, they
tie me up at night!  In Broningham, yet!  I mean, we're here in this dinky
little town, one inn, two cheese-caves, a bunch of stupid hobbit mushroom
farmers, we're only here for one night anyways so it doesn't *matter* if I
steal anything, and they tie me up and set Kurad-Nin to watching me!  I wish
I had a birdcage!  I'd go out there and steal enough money so that we could
*buy* a carridge and ride in style!  But I'll show them tomorrow, and you'd
better believe it!
 
Besides, they're only feeding me cheese.  I don't like cheese.
 
Oime's Diary: (Saturday)
 
Alas, that the Great Art is by my hand and tongue thus perverted!  Alas, that
I must needs have the great thaumaturgies and miracles of magic drip forth,
and be nigh-well wasted on the dwellers in shadow!  Three spells, three
hard-won spells, have I spilled this day; for I must defile my Art or shed my
life.  Once at the grey day's dawning, when the massy gargoyle that whilom
dwelt in the citadel at the center of Bluggiville did come for us, to rend us
from life or by force bring us to the human's hatred, where all must die for
Gwolin's revenge.  Again in the hour of Mercury, the sixth of the day, when
Kjorn forgot her new body and near to drown in the wide Warressy.  And again,
that Gwolin be bound about with spells of warning, so that even if Kurad-Nin
sleeps, we shall know if he breaks his sworn word, and breaks the peace of
Broningham.
 
Blundir: (Sunday)
 
I can eat porridge out of a bowl without using a spoon!  It's just wonderful!
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Kjorn's diary (Sunday):
 
[...] Damn Damn Damn Damn Damn Damn Damn.  I did not mean to do it.  I want
to pull out all my fur, hair by hair.  I am going to get rid of this body as
soon as I can.  I hate these reflexes. Damn Damn Damn Damn Damn Damn Damn.
[...]
 
Gwolin's diary (Sunday):
 
And after all their tying me up, it's *Kjorn* who gets us into trouble!  We
go up to this Hobbit farmer's house, and try to buy dinner.  We're talking to
the farmer's wife, Mrs. Procilla Bannockbring, and her kids are playing by
the side of the road.  Suddenly one of them runs up and pulls Kjorn's tail.
So of course Kjorn kicks the kid with a hind leg.  The kid goes flying into
the ditch, and lies there screaming her head off.  Well, her head doesn't
come off, but her ear is pretty much gone.  Procilla goes berserk and starts
whacking Kjorn on the head with a rolling pin -- and the stupid woman just
stands there and lets her do it!  Oime runs over and starts dripping on the
kid, paying no attention to Kjorn at all.  Blundir and Kurad-Nin are totally
useless.  Finally I have to go put a dagger to Procilla's throat to get her
to stop pounding Kjorn.  Then Mr. Bargo Bannockbring and two farmhands come
running over, and as soon as they see me with the dagger they fall on their
faces and surrender.  Then Oime gets up and starts *apologizing*!  And Kjorn
charges *me*, and damn near kills me --- even though I saved her sooty
*life*!
 
Not only wouldn't they let me loot the place, they insisted that we pay them
fifty circenes! Fifty coal-blooded circenes!  And of course the rest of them
don't have fifty circenes together, so I have to pay two thirds of them out
of my own pouch.  And we didn't even get a sooty dinner out of them!  We're
camping on roots tonight and eating moldy cheese, except for Kjorn who is
cinder-pounding *celebrating*!  And I have to put up the tent, even though
it's her turn!
 
Oime's diary (Sunday):
 
[...] All that deep magic can do to heal, I have done and done thrice, and I
have even given Pando to drink from the healing mead that drips from my
beard, but it shall help him little.  Four scars will he have for ever and
aye, and little enough will there ever be of his ear; nor shall he hear
therefrom again.  There is less that I can do to heal Kjorn; her, too, I have
given much mead, and she now sleeps; but I fear that her spirit will war with
her body, her swift and bloodthirsty body, and give her no peace until she is
restored to herself.
 
 
 
Blundir's diary (Sunday):
 
I stuck my tongue out at the hobbit kids and made them laugh today, even
poor little Pando with the big bandage around his head.
 
 
PS: no, Pando did not change sex.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Kjorn's Diary (Tuesday):
 
Oime is being very funny these days.  She is treating me as if I were made of
glass.  She has even been volunteering to do the dishes, whenever I start.
I'm going to enjoy it.  It won't last long.
 
Gwolin's Diary (Wednesday):
 
I'm a hero again!  We were eating lunch in Chammaty, in this little place
called the Placid Cow.  Hobbits really know how to eat!  I had just finished
up my third plate of venison sausages when these two human guys in fancy
jeweled chainmail came in.  They sat down and ordered roast pig.  The Placid
Cow was serving venison sausages with bacon today, so of course they didn't
have any roast pig.  Dirty humans probably got their tastes in a soldier's
camp anyway.
 
So they got up and started insisting that they were Great Knight Sir Norbern
of Mishtragrand, something like that, and his Squire.  And of course they
thought that being Sir Norbean of Mergraband and his Squire meant that Mrs.
Cheesemarket should go kill a pig and roast it and have it roasted brown and
on their plates in a thin stone's fall.  Mrs. Cheesemarket said that Sir
Norburp would have to wait three hours for his pig to roast even if she
started it now, which she wasn't about to, not with a room full of people so
busy eating venison sausages and bacon.  So the Squirter of Sir Norbong of
Mistergrank pounded the table and rattled his jeweled chainmail and said that
Great Knight would not be insulted, and that he would have redress.  Well,
Mrs. Cheesemarket stomped back into the kitchen and brought me out another
plate of sausages, and as she walked past them the guy who called himself a
squile reached out and shook her.  Well, he got the sausages in his face.  He
howled and slapped her, and she nearly broke his nose with her ladle.
 
So the Squayre drew a short sword with a nasty hooked tip and lots of gold
wire twined around the handle.  So there Mrs. Cheesemarket was, facing this
Squirrel person ladle to short sword, and Sir Norbump of Mogglebump getting
out a mace and a crossbow and a javelin and a glaive-guisarme and a grenado
and an arquebus and a trireme and a wakizashi and a trident and a claymore
and a katana and a battleaxe and a ballista and and a greatsword bigger than
Mrs. Cheesemarket was, all for one hobbit.  Kjorn jumped up (she was standing
already, so she got there first) and broke a stool on the Squiddle's elbow,
and I ran over and stuck my neat blue dagger up under Sir Norburp of
Mistygrinch's fancy jeweled chainmail skirt.  He yowled like a stuck pig -- I
guess it comes from eating so many of them -- and fell over and wriggled, and
I got his purse and two of the pouches around his belt.  A couple of the
hobbits had gotten up by then, and took his weapons away.  I guess one of
them was a chirurgeon or something, he started taking off Sir Norbleat of
Middlegash's armor and sopping up blood with napkins.  I told the chirurgeon
were to tie a tourniquet, but he didn't do it.  Anyway, Sir Norbleed of
Mixtergland kicked one of the hobbits into the wall for that, and broke her
skull, but the chirurgeon explained what he was doing, and Plentiflora the
scullery-maid bopped Sir Norbloke of Milfterboing on the head with a chopping
block a few times, and he quieted down and let the chirurgeon take care of
him.  When the bandages got there, I made sure that they tied some around his
hands and feet too, just in case.
 
So the hobbits were pretty happy with us.  Mrs. Cheesemarket gave us a big
basket of food, and the Mayor of Chammaty got someone to lend us three more
donkeys, and we're staying in his house tonight.  I got Sir Norbladder of
Mibblebubble's helm, which has lots of gemstones on it, and the Mayor
actually *gave* me Sir Norbbley of Mobblebabble's dagger with the eagle's
claw on the tip. Kjorn had decided to keep the Squaffle's short sword with
the nasty hooked tip and lots of gold wire twined around the handle.  They
decided to take Sir Nibblebutter of Mixerbeanie and the Squiggle's weapons,
and if they gave them to us, we'd take them away and if Sir Nimmowbrain of
Mizzorgizzard and his Squaker want them back, they'll have to come after us,
and Sir Nifflegram of Moddergwatch isn't going to be riding very far for a
good many weeks to come.
 
Kjorn's Diary (Wednesday):
 
Gwolin is pretty pleased with himself, isn't he?  Oime is acting very
strange, though.  She kept trying to get me to "let go of my bitterness" and
things like that.  I don't really know what she means.  She was saying
something about me being upset about my accident with Pando, so I clawed
Squire Guilliame in the stomach after I disarmed him, and doesn't believe me
when I say that I was defending Mrs. Cheesemarket.  And she tried to give me
some herb tea to go to sleep by, and when I said no, she looked as if she
wanted to cast a spell.
 
Letter by Sir Norberg of Mishtragrand to his lady wife Esmerella:
 
Sir Norberg to his lady wife, greetings.
 
Brigands and monstres hav besett mee on my Way to the Dore of Norns, and I am
such africhted that I shal nowise arrive in time that the Company be stopped
ere it march to our very world And dorstep.  In Chamattie, A poore and
Drangly town of hobitts, Gwiliam and I Had Stoppedd for our noontide meal at
a meager inn.  So meagre that wen we asked for Pork, the huslady did nothing
to Get it, saying that she could no be bother to send the scoollery maid out
to buy it elsewhire.  We sihed, and prepared to lunch On her greasy sausages.
But when she broucht them To us, she was of such a sullen dispostion and
Contential Nature, and so much enraged to Madness by our suggestion that we
micht eat what We wished, that then she flung the sausages into Guilliame's
face and smote him michty with a ladle.  Sir Gilliames, being a Man of arms
and used to the field of war, by Long-drilled habit drew his Knife.  But ere
he culd put it away, a fell chimera of orgre and lyon, larger than an horse,
swinging a club which even I micht scarce lift in Two hands, lept upon him.
His left arm Is Broke (you do recal that he holds with the sinister), and he
has manie Deep claw-wonds on his belly and legs Even thrauch his
Mage-strenchtened armoring.  When I Rose myself to help him, a scoundrel who
had been hiding behind mee waiting for just such a moment leapt forth,
hamstringing mee and stealing my purse.  I fell to the ground, and was
clouted the side of my head on a table with sich a blow as I felt I micht
never walk again.  By good hap, the Mayor of Chamtie -- a stout man, if not a
Noble one, was Walking by, and at his second or third call did the Horde of
hoobbits cease to asult Mee.  I am resting at his home, but it shall be two
Weeks or three ere I can walk Again.  And much was stolen, my Weapons and
Certain Talismans and charms, as well as my purse bee gone.  In another leter
I hav sent Gregory to swift bring mee money and arms, and divers spells of
sorcery; do You aid him and swiftly send him on his way, For I am sore in
need.
 
In haste,
  thy loving husband.
 
(Post Scriptum by Guilliame: Dearest Esmerella, this ill hap may turn to our
good fortune.  For such was the injury that Sir Norberg did take at the
hobbits' hands that he shall belike have not the wherewithal to be a husband
to you, for though his wound is not so grave, the chirurgeon is such a filthy
and drunken scoundrel that surely it shall soon be mortified and make him
less than a full man.  And then he shall surely come less often to thy
chambers, and our time together shall be long and joyful.  In haste, but with
great wishes for our future happiness and love, I remain Guoilliame, [etc.])

                                 In Taberna
 
Gwolin's Diary
 
I sold two of the blue-threaded pearls and one of the opabins from Sir
Nirblefart of Mobblebladder's helm in Vernicolo for about six thousand
Circenes.  Sir Neeblebland of Mixtlebrobble must be a very rich man!  Or he
must have been, anyways.  So I had a lead camel's load of money in my pouch,
and fifty times that in gemstones waiting to be sold.  This meant that it was
time for a party.  So this morning when we were on the road, I promised that
we would eat dinner in the best restaurant in the town that we stopped for
the night.
 
Well, I didn't need to have sold those pearls and opabins to treat everyone
at the best restaurant in Hoggles-on-Ermwasket.  The whole evening only cost
about thirty circenes, plus another dozen or so for extras, but I'm getting
ahead of myself.   We passed through Harriford on the way there a bit after
noon, and I would have been happy to treat everyone to a dinner of roast wild
frobudgeon, but Kjorn and Oime wanted to keep going.  So that left us in
Hoggles-on-Ermwasket.  We asked around, and it turns out that the best place
to eat is this tavern called the Wise Panda, and it's run by butter goblins.
 
Well, we were all pretty leery about going to a place run by goblins, but
this was a bunch of *hobbits* telling us to eat there, so we decided to try
it.  The place was packed (with hobbits, so we knew they weren't fooling),
and we had to wait half an hour before we got a table.  When we did, it was a
great table, though.  We were right under the oak tree, and we could see the
newt-flashers off to the right and watch the sun go down over the Ermwasket
to the left, and Kurad-Nin could perch in the branches and they even brought
out some baskets of seeds for him.
 
The Wise Panda is one of these family style places.  Everyone sits at round
tables, and they bring out huge plates of food and put them in the middle of
the table and everyone dives for them and thirty seconds later the food is
all gone and they bring out another huge plate.  We were sharing our table
with two priests of Ameniodrarius, a tailor and his family (who came there
because his wife Maureen had a cold and didn't want to cook, and he had just
sold three embroidered gowns to the mayor), and an owl-dragon named Hyrex
Hermocules taking up three chairs, and the waitress was this cute little
butter goblin named Rosie, short for Rosamundi, with long dark hair and eyes
almost as big as Hyrex's.
 
The first course was eels boiled in wine with asparagus and onions.
Sacerglorio, the senior priest took one look at the plate and intoned "This
dish is _turpibus_ and _impudicibusque_.  It must be removed hence at once to
the kitchen, and a proper and dignified food brought henceforth therefrom
instanter."  The junior priest cowered.  Nollie, the tailor's younger son,
screamed "I hate eeeeels!"
 
Hyrex looked Sacerglorio straight in the face with his astounding eyes, and
said "You declined that wrong, I think."  Sacerglorio turned fifteen
different colors which I have never seen on a human before (including three
that I have never seen before at all), and sat down like a man falling into a
bottomless hole. I helped myself to Sacerglorio's eels, and gave Blundir
Nollie's share.  The junior priestess sat very still in her seat, but kept
looking over at Sacerglorio and wondering if he was too stunned to notice her
eating an eel.
 
Sacerglorio was a man of stern-cut cloth, and it wasn't long before he was
only five or six colors, and standing up and intoning sonorous phrases again.
"Fools that you are!" he declaimed, "to eat of this, the very food of
temptation!  Beware, beware, lest you find yourself driven to lecherous sin!"
Rosie the butter goblin was standing right behind him, stabbing the air with
her finger whenever he stabbed it with his.  Maureen squeezed her husband's
hand.  The tailor's teenage daughter smirked.  Nollie whined "Daadee, what's
a lecherous sin?"  His older brother whispered "It's a kind of zombie that
eats babies up at night, so watch out!"  The tailor stooped over and
whispered something stern-sounding to both of them.  There was a loud squack
from the kitchen as some large bird was driven one step closer to being the
main course, and one step further away from lecherous sin.
 
Blundir looked at Sacerglorio and asked "I've eaten lots of eels in
wine, but I've almost never been driven anywhere.  They always make me
walk."  Sacerglorio was ready to say something pontifical, but then Blundir
licked the wine sauce off of his lips and Sacerglorio turned another two or
three colors and squeaked.  Everyone turned to look at Blundir, so I stole
Sacerglorio's golden ankh.   Hyrex forgot himself, and stared just like
everyone else, and poor Blundir had no choice but to stick his tongue out
across the table and gaze into the owl-dragon's amazing eyes with a helpless
expression on his face.  All the tailor's children howled something at once,
and most of the rest of the children in the tavern did too.
 
Kjorn slammed her stein down on the table, and shouted "Stop it!  Let him
alone!" at Hyrex.  I knew she was crazy enough to tackle an owl dragon in the
middle of a restaurant alone, so I slipped over and got out my blue crystal
dagger.  Rosie came over and put a hand on what she must of thought was my
hand to stop me, as Hyrex apologized and let Blundir go. Blundir only turned
one color, but turned it bright enough to light up the whole tavern.  Rosie
didn't mind the tentacles.
 
Sacerglorio couldn't think of anything much to say to this, so he sat down
and scowled at a bun.  The junior priestess ate hers with butter, and kept
stealing glances at the eels.  The tailor's older son picked up a small eel,
tilted his head back, and tried to swallow it whole; fortunately, Kjorn was
close enough to keep him from choking on it.  A minute later, Nollie did it
successfully with a stalk of asparagus.  Blundir sat there hiding his head
behind a napkin, but Kjorn whispered to him until he took it off and stared
at his plate, nibbling on onions.
 
After a few more minutes, the eels were gone except for the ones on Blundir's
and Nollie's plates. (Maureen had made Nollie take one eel.) Rosie and
another goblin brought us an immense tray with three roast swans on it.
She took out a knife bigger than herself from a pocket, and started whisking
it on a sharpening steel.  Hyrex said "Pray do not trouble yourself cutting
mine," and stared at the largest swan until it got up out of the pool of
carrots and snails and walked across the table to lie down in his plate.
 
Sacerglorio howled "Blasphemy!  Summoning of the undead is the darkest evil!
And would you then eat of it, _obscurissimus_?"  and tripped over his chair
trying to get up.  The priestess scrambled over to drag him up, but he was
too wild and pulled her down on top of himself.  Nollie whined "Mummy, what's
wrong with the priestie?"  Rosie flung down the knife and glared at the
tangled priests.  After a moment Sacerglorio kicked the priestess off of him,
bowling down two dentists and a rather astounded ostridge at the next table.
He jumped on the table and kicked Hyrex' swan.  Hyrex made some polite sounds
of disapproval as he caught the swan in one claw.
 
Red as a burning beet, Sacerglorio started chanting "_Dies, nox, et omnia,
descendo minoratus_ ...".  The blue lines dripped from his outstreached hand
and started the table melting.  Oime started chanting "Krezu Gargel-ieoi, xe
argula;  ouvela;  Essela", and the priestess "Veni Creator Spiritus...".  Rosie
whacked at Sacerglorio with the sharpening steel.  The steel touched the
lines, though, and started melting as well.  Hyrex was too astounded to do
anything but take a bite of the swan in his left claw.  The tailor, his wife,
and the older son ran to Bluggiville in six seconds.  The daughter stopped by
the door of the tavern.  Nollie jumped up and down and squealed with joy.
 
The priestess threw a shower of copper-colored shell-shaped sparkles at the
blue lines, and Oime called up a small green cloud with lots of sharp teeth.
Sacerglorio swung the lines like a sword.  The sparkles scattered across the
room, some of them landing in people's steins and sending up hissing,
evanescent coppery birds made of winy steam.  The sword struck the cloud and
punctured it, and it fell to the table leaking green smoke.  Nollie tried to
catch it in a napkin.
 
Kjorn ducked under the lines and shoved Sacerglorio forward.  He took one
step too far, and his leg went through the melted part of the table.  Rosie's
steel had melted almost to the hilt; she had picked up a spoon in her left
hand and was trying to pry her fingers off of it.  I grabbed each finger with
three tentacles and pulled as hard as I could.  Together we got her hand off
before she had lost more than one joint of a finger.  Hyrex grabbed
Sacerglorio with his glare.  The ostridge, not really following what was
going on but determined to join the fight, kicked the priestess in the belly.
The green smoke landed in the swan-plate, and desparately tryed to plug its
side with a carrot.
 
Oime somehow stopped the table and steel from melting any further.  Kurad-Nin
calmed the ostridge down.  Hyrex squeezed Sacerglorio down to half his size.
Somehow Sacerglorio managed to cloth himself in a rush of fire and bound up
the chimney and away.  Rosie didn't let go of my tentacles, so I put some
more of them around her.   Nollie gave up trying to catch the smoke, and
tried to help it plug the hole.   Blundir hid behind his napkin again, sure
that somehow the whole thing was his own fault.
 
Well, cleaning it up wasn't so hard, except that the table was ruined and
Rosie kept wanting to go chasing Sacerglorio and make him unmelt her
finger,and she was too shocked to want to wait tables any more that evening.
Kjorn argued with her a long time, and finally she agreed that Sacerglorio
could probably kill her without any trouble at all.  I didn't really want
Rosie to be a waitress any more that evening either -- I'd have to take my
tentacles off her -- and so finally I invited her to eat with us somewhere
else .  The Wise Panda was pretty crowded and everyone was staring at us, so
we left and went to Wabbatty's for fried fish and apples.  Hyrex came with
us.  I don't know where the other people went.
 
The rest of dinner was pretty pleasant, except that it was full of surprises.
First the other waiter from the Wise Panda came running in and told Rosie
that she was fired unless she came back at once.  I hit him with a
five-circene coin on his left ear.  Rosie laughed, and that was that.
 
Then Maureen came and shouted at me for (1) rescuing "that butter goblin"
instead of Nollie, and (2) giving Nollie the green smoky thing with a carrot
in its side as a pet.  Oime finally stood up and talked mysteriously to her
of Dark Secrets and Hidden Purposes Beyond the Ken of Ordinary Hobbits.
Maureen turned pale and left.  Then Oime went back to talking mysteriously to
the rest of us about Dark Secrets and Hidden Purposes Beyond the Ken of
Ordinary Dwarves and Butter Goblins and Owl Dragons and Whatnot, like usual.
We ignored her.
 
Then Hyrex looked at me a long time, until all my colors flowed into my boots
and I stood there shivering and transparent.  After a while he let me sit
down and drink a mug of mulled wine.  (Rosie rubbed my back.)  I asked him
why he did it, but he only said that he couldn't find even a tiny seam in the
curse, and I should talk to a great wizard to have it removed.  Rosie asked
"What curse?", so Kjorn and I took her by the fire and we told her
everything.
 
So it's been a pretty exciting day.  Rosie is going home for the night, but
she's promised to meet us at Emilio's Grand Bakery for breakfast.

                            At the Ruined Temple
                         Dwarf Diaries, Part 1 A.N.
 
 
(Kjorn's Diary, Monday):
 
After the excitement last night, we all slept rather late this morning.  I
woke up with a haribande singing on my windowsill.  Gwolin, of course, was up
with the sprandils and geese, going to his breakfast date with Rosie.  Rosie,
it turns out, had gone home and fought furiously for four hours with her
roommate Eleanor.  Once Eleanor had tried to make up, but she squeezed
Rosie's hand -- Rosie's wounded hand and that set off the fight again.
Finally Eleanor went to sleep, and Rosie went and watched the stars go down
for the last time from the Village Oak, so she went to bed about the time
that Gwolin was getting up.
 
Eventually this all got sorted out, and the six of us had a very fine late
lunch at Emilio's Grand Bakery, with thirteen seed buns of different kinds
for Kurad-Nin, and we bought two dozen loaves and a gigantic wolio pie to
take with us.  And we stopped at Cornmobble's bookshop, and bought a map of
the area: no more wondering how far it is to the next town, or asking
confused peasants.
 
Because Rosie is coming with us, at least as far as Mistancleagh.  She has
decided that she'd rather try to find someone to try to heal her finger
(which hurts considerably, and is covered with tiny blue lines) than stay
here and seek a fifth job as a waitress, with so many of the restaurants in
town having fired her already.  She also seems to want to get away from
Eleanor her roommate.  I don't think I need to say what Gwolin thinks about
this.  I've never seen him gloat so much in my life.
 
 
(Kjorn's Diary, Wednesday)
 
Blundir and I caught a brace of frobudgeon with mallets today, so we had to
stop early to cook them.  We didn't want to carry them farther than we had
to, so we looked on the map and found that there was a monastary of the Order
of Cameleord in the area.  We followed the road through the forest, which
wasn't easy; it was overgrown, and wandered through streams, and forked in
ways that the map didn't mention.  After hiking for an hour (and carrying one
of the frobudgeons on my back, as the donkeys wouldn't stand the blood),
Kurad-Nin flying overhead saw some very monastic walls in the distance, and
we scrambled through the brush to get there.  It turned out to be a temple of
St. Lixy, windows overgrown with ivy, the chapel a pool of mud, and obviously
long abandoned.  We slogged through muddy halls to the kitchen, which was
somewhat higher than the rest of the building and fairly clean.  There was
almost enough room in the great fireplace with the figure of Lixy carved over
it to roast the frobudgeons.
 
Of course there wasn't any wood in the kitchen, and the woodheap outdoors was
inhabited by a large family of glistening red skinks, so we sent Gwolin into
the forest to collect firewood and mushrooms.  He didn't do it, of course.
Instead he brought back three pilgrims, two gnomes (Brogi with a bandage on
his left leg, and Hamerio wearing a yellow cap), and a rajik named
Ponghashtidar.  They also had a map from Cornmobble, but it didn't look
anything like our map, and neither of them looked anything like the land we
had walked through.  Brogi's pony had snatched a bite of unwise binderfresh
by the side of the road, and was suffering from staggers and palpitations.
Gwolin the ever-generous had offered Oime's skill with herbs for the pony and
a leg of my frobudgeon for the pilgrims.
 
Well, and he had the right of it.  Oime was more than happy to leave the
cooking to Rosie and Gwolin, and take a look at the pony.  The pony goggled
back at her bats with terrified eyes the size of saucers, and nearly fell
into the fire when it saw me. I went back to the fireplace with the bust of
Lixy to help Rosie, who appreciated being rescued from Gwolin's unsubtle
tentacles and took the opportunity to nearly char the rest of her finger off
in the fireplace. (She says that heat makes it feel better.)  Two minutes
later, of course, Oime came down and sent me into the woods to pick a tassle
of St.  Odin's Wort and charnberry, which she boiled up and put in some
oatmeal and fed it to the pony.
 
Then she, herself, went into the forest to gather some more herbs.  She came
back with a large basket full of unearthly vegetation, most of it still
wriggling gently.  She put three pots of varying sizes on the hearth next to
the frobudgeons, filled two with water and one with wine, and casually and
randomly threw her herbs into them -- three stalky blue-green things in the
big pot, then two of the floppy ones with yellow tendrils into the wine, then
the bushy one with tiny claws into the big pot, then the one chanting its
death-chant into the small pot, and so on, talking about magic all the while
and not even looking at what she was doing.  The pilgrims stared at her as if
she was crazy. Finally, she was down to six tiny mushrooms which whimpered
when she picked them up. She stared at them as if she didn't know how they
had gotten there, and very likely she didn't. She shook them a little (they
rattled), frowned at them, looked very carefully at all three of the pots,
and finally dropped them in Gwolin's beer, where they fizzled and smoked and
finally vanished without a trace.  Nobody had the slightest idea what she was
doing, probably not even Oime, and everybody stared at her completely
baffled, even the bust of Lixy, and nobody could think of anything to say, so
everybody was quiet when Gwolin came back and drank it.  It didn't calm him
down any, though, if that's what she was trying to do.
 
And so we sat and waited for the frobudgeon to cook.  Hamerio brought out some
expensive tlin imported on the backs of heretics from Meridakatu, and we sat
around the fireplace under the carved head of Lixy holding hot steaming
aromatic mugs and keeping out the cold.  And the conversation quickly turned to
our troubles and woes.  It does that a lot, these days; people usually ask
Oime about her bats, giving her a chance to say something sonorous and
arcane.  So Hamerio politely asked if we were all cursed by sorcery.
 
Gwolin, most sensitive of men, said, "Yes, everybody but Rosie."
 
Rosie glowered at him.  "My finger is giving me far more pain than your
invisible tentacles have ever given you, mister thief!"
 
Gwolin sputtered and grovelled for a few minutes too, and then Brogi rescued
him, explaining how his hand, too, was injured by sorcery.  It seems that
Brogi had sold five charixalatlu feathers on credit to a wizard of Melidor,
but had not known that they came from a male bird.  And of course when the
wizard went to conjure with them, one of them woke up and pierced his left
leg all the way through.  When Brogi came to collect his price from the
wizard, the wizard had paid him in a curse instead: that each day at dawn,
something should stab him through in that same place.  He has to carry a
sharp clean silver skewer and stab himself, lest something worse do it for
him.
 
Hamerio was the most pious of gnomes.  He had persuaded Brogi to go on a
pilgrimage and find a god who would cure him, and he was determined to ask at
every temple until someone answered -- and just because this temple was
abandoned and ruined wasn't going to stop him. He knelt in front of the
fireplace, knocking over Oime's mug in the process, and prayed to Lixy:
"Great and wonder-ridden saint, look upon us in our plight.  We beg of you,
in your boundless mercy and understanding, to bring joy and health and
happiness to those two among us who are most in despair and pain for the many
hurts and harms they have taken."  And the bust of Lixy answered in a voice
like starlight on still water, saying "Fear not, good gnome, and I shall
grant thy prayer when the moon rises."
 
Everyone stared at the fireplace, and none more astonished than Hamerio
himself.  Rosie clapped her hands as if she was already healed, and yelped
when she realized she wasn't.  The moon wasn't due to rise 'till well after
midnight.  Brogi knelt beside his brother and gave thanks.  Gwolin looked a
bit disappointed, obviously afraid that Rosie would go back to
Hoggles-on-Ermwasket.
 
Dinner was rather a feast; everyone had a hand in it. Rosie and I made a very
elegant sauce of white wine and garlic for the frobudgeon.  The pilgrims
brought out some very sharp old Sorgenfrei cheese which they melted on top of
slices of the breast.  Blundir and Kurad-Nin had gathered some almonds and
marrownuts on the way, and even Gwolin had picked up six ripe, orange, juicy
proys, which he gave to Rosie with his guess at what a gallant gesture might
look like.  She didn't look completely pleased by it, though; but perhaps she
was just anxious for moonrise and healing.  Moonrise was still hours off, and
her finger hurt more than ever with anticipation.
 
Two of Oime's potions were for the horse, but the one with wine was for us;
and a thoroughly terrifying sauce it was too.  She said it is an old family
recipe, but I can't remember my aunt ever making anything like it -- and I
don't believe that anyone but Oime could find any of those herbs.  I've
certainly never seen anything like them.  None of us would touch it, and even
the gnomes weren't brave enough to try something that color; they said it
would clash with their Sorgenfrei.  But Oime sat there, dipping little pieces
of bread and white meat into it and eating them quite happily, and finally
Ponghashtidar decided to try some of it.  And of course he jumped eight feet
off the ground at one taste of it, and stayed there until the next morning,
and neither Oime nor Rosie nor Hamerio could coax him down.  And moonrise was
still hours away.
 
So we finished off most of one frobudgeon, and almost half of the other, as
well as all the rest of the food.  Everyone was stuffed, and moonrise was
still hours away.  Rosie and I spent twenty minutes persuading Gwolin, who
hadn't done any work yet that day, to do the dishes.  Brogi and Oime went to
try to coax the pony to drinking one of the potions.  The rest of us listened
to its protests and occasional demands for a lawyer and/or exorcist for a
while, but moonrise was still hours away, and so Rosie volunteered to help me
try to dust off the beds.
 
All of the the beds that were still dry were inhabited by large scaly spiders
who protested violently when they were disturbed, and two of them were homes
to some very determined brown toads who threatened to start petitions
evicting us from the temple if we so much as slept in the same room as them.
So we came back to the kitchen, where moonrise turned out to still be hours
away and Blundir was doing the dishes under Gwolin's supervision.  Nobody
particularly wanted to be the one to move the spiders and toads, and Hamerio
quickly remembered that Ste. Lixy was known for kindness to animals as well
as people, and she would probably be displeased if we disturbed her temple's
inhabitants.  And moonrise was still hours away.
 
So, we decided to all of us sleep in the kitchen.  This hardly ended the
matter, as there were nine of us and only space for fourteen or fifteen and
moonrise was still hours away, but finally we agreed that Rosie should sleep
on one side of me and Gwolin on the other, and that Oime would promise not to
snore in Blundir's ear, and that we should put a blanket on the floor in case
Ponghashtidar came down.  And moonrise was still hours away.
 
Finally, we finished the last of the negotiations and arranged the bedrolls.
Oime was soon snoring noisily to an audience of ancient pots and pans hanging
on the wall and a slowly-growing crowd of bats, and her beard in a bowl so as
not to soak her bed. Blundir was next to her with plugs of parsley in his
ears.  Gwolin, to his credit, never once tried to sneak a tentacle over me
and went right to sleep.  Rosie was too excited to sleep, even though
moonrise was still hours away, and kept wriggling whenever I dozed off.
Hamerio and Brogi were on the great chopping-block, sometimes talking in low
whispers.  Kurad-Nin was mostly sleeping on the banisters, and Ponghashtidar
was still in the air.
 
And finally moonrise was no longer hours away, and everyone but Gwolin woke
up. A shimmering figure rushed into the kitchen from the general direction of
the chapel, a bright and ethereal bird perched on each hand.  She glided
around the room, once, swiftly looking at each of us, a look like a rush of
cold water on a broiling day.  Then she stood in the middle of the room, and
pointed; and the birds flew where she pointed, and there they healed.
 
The frobudgeons on the hearth stood up and gave the Saint their courtesy,
but she was gone.  Then they glared once at Blundir and twice at me for
killing them and three times round again at all of us for eating them, and
stalked out of the ruined temple as elegant as icicles.  Nobody could think of
anything to say, but I held Rosie for an hour while she cried herself to
sleep.

                   A Descent into the Maelstrom

The ways of God in Nature, as in Providence, are not as our ways;
nor are the models that we frame in any way commensurate to the
vastness, profundity, and unsearchableness of His works which
have a depth in them greater than the well of Democritus.
                                        JOSEPH GLANVILL

     We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag.  For
some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.
     'Not long ago,' said he at length, 'and I could have guided
you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about
three years past, there happened to me an event such as never
happened before to mortal man--or, at least, such as no man ever
survived to tell of--and the six hours of deadly terror which I
then endured have broken me up body and soul.  You suppose me a
very old man--but I am not.  It took less than a single day to
change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my
limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least
exertion, and am frightened at a shadow.  Do you know I can
scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy?'
     The 'little cliff', upon whose edge he had so carelessly
thrown himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his
body hung over it, while he was only kept from falling by the
tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edge--this
'little cliff' arose, a sheer unobstructed precipice of black
shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world
of crags beneath us.  Nothing would have tempted me to be within
half a dozen yards of its brink.  In truth so deeply was I
excited by the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at
full length upon the ground, clung to the shrubs around me, and
dared not even glance upward at the sky--while I struggled in
vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of
the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds.  It was
long before I could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit
up and look out into the distance.
     'You must get over these fancies,' said the guide, 'for I
have brought you here that you might have the best possible view
of the scene of that event I mentioned--and to tell you the whole
story with the spot just under your eye.
     'We are now,' he continued, in that particularizing manner
which distinguished him--'we are now close upon the Norwegian
coast--in the sixty-eighth degree of latitude--in the great
province of Nordland--and in the dreary district of Lofoden.  The
mountain upon whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy.  Now
raise yourself up a little higher--hold on to the grass if you
feel giddy--so--and look out, beyond the belt of vapour beneath
us, into the sea.'
     I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose
waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the
Nubian geographer's account of the Mare Tenebrarum.  A panorama
more deplorably desolate no human imagination can conceive.  To
the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, there lay
outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black
and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the more
forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against it
its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking for ever. 
Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and
at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was
visible a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its
position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which
it was enveloped.  About two miles nearer the land, arose another
of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at
various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.
     The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more
distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about
it.  Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward
that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed
trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight,
still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a
short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction--as
well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise.  Of foam there was
little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.
     'The island in the distance,' resumed the old man, 'is
called by the Norwegian Vurrgh.  The one midway is Moskoe.  That
a mile to the northward is Ambaaren.  Yonder are Islesen,
Hotholm, Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm.  Further off--between
Moskoe and Vurrgh--are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and
Stockholm.  These are the true names of the places--but why it
has been thought necessary to name them at all, is more than
either you or I can understand.  Do you hear anything?  Do you
see any change in the water?'
     We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen,
to which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that we
had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from
the summit.  As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and
gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of
buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same moment I
perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the
ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which set
to the eastward.  Even while I gazed, this current acquired a
monstrous velocity.  In five minutes the whole sea as far as
Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between
Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway.  Here
the vast bed of the waters seamed and scarred into a thousand
conflicting channels, burst suddenly into frenzied convulsion--
heaving, boiling, hissing--gyrating in gigantic and innumerable
vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a
rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes, except in
precipitous descents.
     In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another
radical alteration.  The general surface grew somewhat more
smooth, and the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while
prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been
seen before.  These streaks, at length, spreading out to a great
distance, and entering into combination, took unto themselves the
gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the
germ of another more vast.  Suddenly--very suddenly--this assumed
a distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more than a
mile in diameter.  The edge of the whirl was represented by a
broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped
into the mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as
the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black
wall of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-
five degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and
sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling
voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty
cataract of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.
     The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. 
I threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an
excess of nervous agitation.
     'This,' said I at length, to the old man--'this can be
nothing else than the great whirlpool of the Maelstrom.'
     'So it is sometimes termed,' said he.  'We Norwegians call
it the Moskoe-strom, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.'
     The ordinary account of this vortex had by no means prepared
me for what I saw.  That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the
most circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception
either of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene--or of
the wild bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the
beholder.  I am not sure from what point of view the writer in
question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have
been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm.  There are
some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be
quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly
feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.
     'Between Lofoden and Moskoe,' he says, 'the depth of the
water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other
side, toward Ver [Vurrgh] this depth decreases so as not to
afford a convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of
splitting on the rocks, which happens even in the calmest
weather.  When it is flood, the stream runs up the country
between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the
roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the
loudest and most dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard
several leagues off, and the vortices or pits are of such an
extent and depth, that if a ship comes within its attraction, it
is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom, and there
beat to pieces against the rocks; and when the water relaxes, the
fragments thereof are thrown up again.  But these intervals of
tranquillity are only at the turn of the ebb and flood, and in
calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence
gradually returning.  When the stream is most boisterous, and its
fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a
Norway mile of it.  Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried
away by not guarding against it before they were carried within
its reach.  It likewise happens frequently, that whales come too
near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and then it
is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their
fruitless struggles to disengage themselves.  A bear once,
attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the
stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be
heard on shore.  Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being
absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to such a
degree as if bristles grew upon them.  This plainly shows the
bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled
to and fro.  This stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of
the sea--it being constantly high and low water every six hours. 
In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it
raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the
houses on the coast fell to the ground.'
     In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how
this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity
of the vortex.  The 'forty fathoms' must have reference only to
portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or
Lofoden.  The depth in the centre of the Moskoe-strom must be
unmeasurably greater; and no better proof of this fact is
necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into
the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of
Helseggen.  Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling
Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with
which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of
belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears, for it
appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest
ships of the line in existence, coming within the influence of
that deadly attraction, could resist it as little as a feather
the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.
     The attempts to account for the phenomenon--some of which, I
remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal--now
wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect.  The idea
generally received is that this, as well as three smaller
vortices among the Ferroe Islands, 'have no other cause than the
collision of waves rising and falling, at flux and reflux,
against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the water so
that it precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher
the flood rises, the deeper must the fall be, and the natural
result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of
which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments'.--  These are
the words of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.  Kircher and others
imagine that in the centre of the channel of the Maelstrom is an
abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote
part--the Gulf of Bothnia being somewhat decidedly named in one
instance.  This opinion, idle in itself, was the one to which, as
I gazed, my imagination most readily assented; and, mentioning it
to the guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that,
although it was the view almost universally entertained of the
subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own.  As
to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it;
and here I agreed with him--for, however conclusive on paper, it
becomes altogether unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the
thunder of the abyss.
     'You have had a good look at the whirl now,' said the old
man, 'and if you creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee,
and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that
will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-strom.'
     I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.
     'Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged
smack of about seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the
habit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to
Vurrgh.  In all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at
proper opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it:
but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we three were the
only ones who made a regular business of going out to the
islands, as I tell you.  The usual grounds are a great way lower
down to the southward.  There fish can be got at all hours,
without much risk, and therefore these places are preferred.  The
choice spots over here among the rocks, however, not only yield
the finest variety, but in far greater abundance; so that we
often got in a single day, what the more timid of the craft could
not scrape together in a week.  In fact, we made it a matter of
desperate speculation--the risk of life standing instead of
labour, and courage answering for capital.
     'We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the
coast than this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to
take advantage of the fifteen minutes' slack to push across the
main channel of the Moskoe-strom, far above the pool, and then
drop down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterham, or Sandflesen,
where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere.  Here we used
to remain until nearly time for slack-water again, when we
weighed and made for home.  We never set out upon this expedition
without a steady side wind for going and coming--one that we felt
sure would not fail us before our return--and we seldom made a
miscalculation upon this point.  Twice, during six years, we were
forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm,
which is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to
remain on the grounds nearly a week, starving to death, owing to
a gale which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the
channel too boisterous to be thought of.  Upon this occasion we
should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything (for
the whirlpools threw us round and round so violently, that, at
length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had not been
that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents--here
to-day and gone to-morrow--which drove us under the lee of
Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.
     'I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties
we encountered "on the ground"--it is a bad spot to be in, even
in good weather--but we make shift always to run the gauntlet of
the Moskoe-strom itself without accident: although at times my
heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so
behind or before the slack.  The wind sometimes was not as strong
as we thought it at starting, and then we made rather less way
than we could wish, while the current rendered the smack
unmanageable.  My eldest brother had a son eighteen years old,
and I had two stout boys of my own.  These would have been of
great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps as well as
afterward in fishing--but, somehow, although we ran the risk
ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get into
the danger--for, after all said and done, it was a horrible
danger, and that is the truth.
     'It is now within a few days of three years since what I am
going to tell you occurred.  It was on the tenth of July, 18--, a
day which the people of this part of the world will never forget-
-for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that
ever came out of the heavens.  And yet all the morning, and
indeed until late in the afternoon, there was a gentle and steady
breeze from the south-west, while the sun shone brightly, so that
the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to
follow.
     'The three of us--my two brothers and myself--had crossed
over to the islands about two o'clock P.M., and soon nearly
loaded the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were
more plenty that day than we had ever known them.  It was just
seven, by my watch, when we weighed and started for home, so as
to make the worst of the Strom at slack water, which we knew
would be at eight.
     'We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and
for some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of
danger, for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend
it.  All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over
Helseggen.  This was most unusual--something that had never
happened to us before--and I began to feel a little uneasy,
without exactly knowing why.  We put the boat on the wind, but
could make no headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the
point of proposing to return to the anchorage, when, looking
astern, we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-
coloured cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity.
     'In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away
and we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction. 
This stage of things, however, did not last long enough to give
us time to think about it.  In less than a minute the storm was
upon us--in less than two the sky was entirely overcast--and what
with this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark that
we could not see each other in the smack.
     'Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt
describing.  The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced
anything like it.  We had to let our sails go by the run before
it cleverly took us; but, at the first puff, both our masts went
by the board as if they had been sawed off--the mainmast taking
with it my youngest brother, who had lashed himself to it for
safety.
     'Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat
upon water.  It had a complete flush deck, with only a small
hatch near the bow, and this hatch it had always been our custom
to batten down when about to cross the Strom, by way of
precaution against the chopping seas.  But for this circumstance
we should have foundered at once--for we lay entirely buried for
some moments.  How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot
say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining.  For my
part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself flat
on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow, and
with my hands grasping a ring-bolt near the foot of the foremast. 
It was mere instinct that prompted me to do this--which was
undoubtedly the very best thing I could have done--for I was too
much flurried to think.
     'For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and
all this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt.  When I
could stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still
keeping hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear. 
Presently our little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog
does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some
measure, of the seas.  I was now trying to get the better of the
stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so as to
see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm.  It
was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I had made
sure that he was overboard--but the next moment all this joy was
turned into horror--for he put his mouth close to my ear, and
screamed out the word "Moskoe-strom!"
     'No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment. 
I shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of
the ague.  I knew what he meant by that one word well enough--I
knew what he wished to make me understand.  With the wind that
now drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of the Strom, and
nothing could save us!
     'You perceive that in crossing the Strom channel, we always
went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather,
and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack--but now
we were driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a
hurricane as this!  "To be sure," I thought, "we shall get there
just about the slack--there is some little hope in that"--but in
the next moment I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to
dream of hope at all.  I knew very well that we were doomed, had
we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.
     'By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent
itself, or perhaps we did not feel it so much, as we scudded
before it, but at all events the seas, which at first had been
kept down by the wind, and lay flat and frothing, now got up into
absolute mountains.  A singular change, too, had come over the
heavens.  Around in every direction it was still as black as
pitch, but nearly overhead there burst out, all at once, a
circular rift of clear sky--as clear as I ever saw--and of a deep
bright blue--and through it there blazed forth the full moon with
a lustre that I never before knew her to wear.  She lit up
everything about us with the greatest distinctness--but, oh God,
what a scene it was to light up.
     'I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother--but
in some manner which I could not understand, the din had so
increased that I could not make him hear a single word, although
I screamed at the top of my voice in his ear.  Presently he shook
his head, looking as pale as death, and held up one of his
fingers, as if to say "listen!"
     'At first I could not make out what he meant--but soon a
hideous thought flashed upon me.  I dragged my watch from its
fob.  It was not going.  I glanced at its face by the moonlight,
and then burst into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean. 
It had run down at seven o'clock!  We were behind the time of the
slack, and the whirl of the Strom was in full fury!
     'When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep
laden, the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem
always to slip from beneath her--which appears strange to a
landsman--and this is what is called ridging, in sea phrase.
     'Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but
presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the
counter, and bore us with it as it rose--up--up--as if into the
sky.  I would not have believed that any wave could rise so high. 
And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge that
made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty
mountain-top in a dream.  But while we were up I had thrown a
quick glance around--and that one glance was all-sufficient.  I
saw our exact position in an instant.  The Moskoe-strom whirlpool
was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead--but no more like the
every-day Moskoe-strom than the whirl, as you now see it, is like
a mill-race.  If I had not known where we were, and what we had
to expect, I should not have recognized the place at all.  As it
was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror.  The lids clenched
themselves together as if in a spasm.
     'It could not have been more than two minutes afterwards
until we suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in
foam.  The boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot
off in its new direction like a thunderbolt.  At the same moment
the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind
of shrill shriek--such a sound as you might imagine given out by
the water-pipes of many thousand steam-vessels letting off their
steam all together.  We were now in the belt of surf that always
surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course, that another
moment would plunge us into the abyss, down which we could only
see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we
were borne along.  The boat did not seem to sink into the water
at all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the
surge.  Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on the
larboard arose the world of ocean we had left.  It stood like a
huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.
     'It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very
jaws of the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only
approaching it.  Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got
rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first.  I
supposed it was despair that strung my nerves.
     'It may look like boasting--but what I tell you is truth--I
began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a
manner, and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a
consideration as my own individual life, in view of so wonderful
a manifestation of God's power.  I do believe that I blushed with
shame when this idea crossed my mind.  After a little while I
became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl
itself.  I positively felt a wish to explore its depths, even at
the sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was
that I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore
about the mysteries I should see.  These, no doubt, were singular
fancies to occupy a man's mind in such extremity--and I have
often thought since, that the revolutions of the boat around the
pool might have rendered me a little light-headed.
     'There was another circumstance which tended to restore my
self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which
could not reach us in our present situation--for, as you saw for
yourself, the belt of the surf is considerably lower than the
general bed of the ocean, and this latter now towered above us, a
high, black, mountainous ridge.  If you have never been at sea in
a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion of mind
occasioned by the wind and spray together.  They blind, deafen,
and strangle you, and take away all power of action or
reflection.  But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these
annoyances--just as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed
petty indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet
uncertain.
     'How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible
to say.  We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying
rather than floating, getting gradually more and more into the
middle of the surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible
inner edge.  All this time I had never let go of the ring-bolt. 
My brother was at the stern, holding on to a small empty water-
cask which had been securely lashed under the coop of the
counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept
overboard when the gale first took us.  As we approached the
brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the
ring, from which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavoured to
force my hands, as it was not large enough to afford us both a
secure grasp.  I never felt deeper grief than when I saw him
attempt this act--although I knew he was a madman when he did it-
-a raving maniac through sheer fright.  I did not care, however,
to contest the point with him.  I knew it could make no
difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him have
the bolt, and went astern to the cask.  This there was no great
difficulty in doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough,
and upon an even keel--only swaying to and fro with the immense
sweeps and swelters of the whirl.  Scarcely had I secured myself
in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to starboard, and
rushed headlong into the abyss.  I muttered a hurried prayer to
God, and thought all was over.
     'As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had
instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my
eyes.  For some seconds I dared not open them--while I expected
instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my
death-struggles with the water.  But moment after moment elapsed. 
I still lived.  The sense of falling had ceased; and the motion
of the vessel seemed much as it had been before, while in the
belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along.  I
took courage and looked once again upon the scene.
     'Never shall I forget the sensation of awe, horror, and
admiration with which I gazed about me.  The boat appeared to be
hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface
of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose
perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but
for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around, and for
the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the rays of
the full moon, from that circular rift amid the clouds which I
have already described, streamed in a flood of golden glory along
the black walls, and far away down into the inmost recesses of
the abyss.
     'At first I was too much confused to observe anything
accurately.  The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that
I beheld.  When I recovered myself a little, however, my gaze
fell instinctively downward.  In this direction I was able to
obtain an unobstructed view, from the manner in which the smack
hung on the inclined surface of the pool.  She was quite upon an
even keel--that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel with
that of the water--but this latter sloped at an angle of more
than forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our
beam ends.  I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had
scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in
this situation, than if we had been upon a dead level; and this,
I suppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved.
     'The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of
the profound gulf: but still I could make out nothing distinctly
on account of a thick mist in which everything there was
enveloped, and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like
that narrow and tottering bridge which Mussulmans says is the
only pathway between Time and Eternity.  This mist, or spray, was
no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the
funnel, as they all met together at the bottom--but the yell that
went up to the heavens from out of that mist I dare not attempt
to describe.
     Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam
above, had carried us to a great distance down the slope; but our
further descent was by no means proportionate.  Round and round
we swept--not with any uniform movement--but in dizzying swings
and jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards--
sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl.  Our progress
downward, at each revolution, was slow, but very perceptible.
     'Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on
which we were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the
only object in the embrace of the whirl.  Both above and below us
were visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building-
timber and trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as
pieces of house furniture, broken boxes, barrels and staves.  I
have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken
the place of my original terrors.  It appeared to grow upon me as
I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom.  I now began to
watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated
in our company.  I must have been delirious, for I even sought
amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their
several descents toward the foam below.  "This fir-tree," I found
myself at one time saying, "will certainly be the next thing that
takes the awful plunge and disappears,"--and then I was
disappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship
overtook it and went down before.  At length, after making
several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all--this
fact--the fact of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a
train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my
heart beat heavily once more.
     'It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn
of a more exciting hope.  This hope arose partly from memory, and
partly from present observation.  I called to mind the great
variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden,
having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-strom. 
By far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the
most extraordinary way--so chafed and roughened as to have the
appearance of being stuck full of splinters--but then I
distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were
not disfigured at all.  Now I could not account for this
difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were
the only ones which had been completely absorbed--that the others
had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, from
some reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they
did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or of
the ebb, as the case might be.  I conceived it possible, in
either instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the
level of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which
had been drawn in more early or absorbed more rapidly.  I made,
also, three important observations.  The first was, that as a
general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their
descent--the second that, between two masses of equal extent, the
one spherical, and the other of any other shape, the superiority
in speed of descent was with the sphere--the third, that, between
two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of
any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly. 
Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this subject
with an old school-master of the district; and it was from him
that I learned the use of the words "cylinder" and "sphere".  He
explained to me--although I have forgotten the explanation--how
what I observed was, in fact, the natural consequence of the
forms of the floating fragments--and showed me how it happened
that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered more resistance to
its suction, and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an
equally bulky body, of any form whatever.1
     'There was one startling circumstance which went a great way
in enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn
them to account, and this was that, at every revolution, we
passed something like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a
vessel,
while many of these things, which had been on our level when I
first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now
high up above us, and seemed to have moved but little from their
original station.
     'I no longer hesitated what to do.  I resolved to lash
myself securely to the water-cask upon which I now held, to cut
it loose from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the
water.  I attracted my brother's attention by signs, pointed to
the floating barrels that came near us, and did everything in my
power to make him understand what I was about to do.  I thought
at length that he comprehended my design--but, whether this was
the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and refused to
move from his station by the ring-bolt.  It was impossible to
reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a
bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to
the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the
counter, and precipitated myself with it into the sea, without
another moment's hesitation.
     'The result was precisely what I hoped it might be.  As it
is myself who now tell you this tale--as you see that I did
escape--and as you are already in possession of the mode in which
this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate all that
I have farther to say--I will bring my story quickly to
conclusion.  It might have been an hour, or thereabouts, after my
quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast distance
beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid
succession and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged
headlong, at once and for ever, into the chaos of foam below. 
The barrel to which I was attached sunk very little further than
half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at
which I leaped overboard, before a great change took place in the
character of the whirlpool.  The slope of the sides of the vast
funnel became momently less and less steep.  The gyrations of the
whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent.  By degrees, the
froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the gulf
seemed slowly to uprise.  The sky was clear, the winds had gone
down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when I
found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the
shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the
Moskoe-strom had been.  It was the hour of the slack--but the sea
still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the
hurricane.  I was borne violently into the channel of the Strom,
and in a few minutes, was hurried down the coast into the
"grounds" of the fishermen.  A boat picked me up--exhausted from
fatigue--and (now that the danger was removed) speechless from
the memory of its horror.  Those who drew me on board were my old
mates and daily companions--but they knew me no more than they
would have known a traveller from the spirit-land.  My hair,
which had been raven black the day before, was as white as you
see it now.  They say too that the whole expression of my
countenance had changed.  I told them my story--they did not
believe it.  I now tell it to you--and I can scarcely expect you
to put more faith in it than did the merry fishermen of Lofoden.'

BUMMERS 
  by Thomas Nevin Huber

  I hate the city. Twenty-five million people and I'm livin' in 
The Pits. The pits of despair, the pits of poverty, the pits of the 
worst of the worst. It can't get any worse.

   Al-Zed is the biggest city on the most populated planet in the
Alliance. It houses the headquarters of the Alliance, the most advanced 
medical center, and the collected works of civilization. If you want 
somethin', you can find it here. If you don't want somethin' -- 
you'll still find it.

   Years ago, cities used to have slums. Ghettos, they called them. They 
used to be out in the open -- eye sores of trash-filled lots, half-burned 
buildings, and boarded-up windows and doors. Al-zed was like that . . . 
for a while. Until they decided to make it the show case of the Alliance.

   But do you think they'd make it a decent place to live? Not as long 
as Ragnoruk remains the prison planet and death world to us Dracs. Make a 
mistake, get caught, and bang! Off they send you to an early grave. Not 
that we can't survive in a double-gravity environment -- we can. It's 
just that we can't live very long in that situation. But then, you know 
all that -- DON'T YOU?

   Enough of this chatter. My story is an oddity, I suppose. First, I'm 
a barmaid down in The Pits. That's what they call this place. When they 
built the so-called model of the universe above us, they didn't bother 
tearin' down where we lived and worked and made love. Instead, they 
just drove the massive pillars right down through our places -- down to 
bedrock, where nothin' could shake them loose.

   Then they built the city on top and left us down here -- in The Pits. 
Where the sun don't shine, and it stinks like I need a shower. That's 
because I really do -- need a shower. No water, at least, not for things 
like that. And the stuff we drink is enough to give a normal Drac a bad 
case of the runs for a month.

   Bad? You bet. But it could be a lot worse. Hell, it is a lot worse. 
I'll tell you about it.

   One night, I was workin' the night shift. Heh! There is no day shift, 
but this was the night, night shift. A little man sat at the end of the 
bar and I'm watchin' him. He's been nursing that drink all night. Causin' 
me no trouble, but he ain't doing much of nothin' either.

   Finally, I decide that he's been alone long enough, so I go up to him 
and nod.

   He glances at me and then stares back at the drink.

   "Need a refill?" I ask.

   "Nope."

   "Need some company?"

   He sighs one of those sighs. Something that sounds like the night 
wind on Ragnoruk's High Plains. You know, kind of ragged and sad. I 
swallow at the sound and stay put. I know for certain that if I move, 
he'll let me wander away. Then there'll be two of us -- lonely and alone. 
It ain't supposed to be that way, but that's the way it is.

   He stares ahead and finally shrugs. "'Spose so," he says. Just like 
that. Nothin' to say yes and nothin' to say no.

   I slide into the seat across from him and wipe away an imaginary spot 
with my bar rag. Not that it does any good. There are plenty of real 
spots on that table.

   "Ever been in love?" he asks, all of a sudden, like.

   I stare at him, but he doesn't return my look. Just sittin' there, 
that little man with his half-finished drink.

   Well, I'm not very good at talkin' or maybe you hadn't noticed how 
I can't stay on a subject very good and I know that my grammar could 
use some help. So I shrug and he nods.

   "I know whatcha mean," he replies.

   I scratch at an itch on the side of my nose and stare at one of the 
beams they drove through this place. Just part of it made its way into 
the room, so one wall is mostly beam. And crushed furniture. We sawed 
the ends off, 'cause that's all we could do.

   The stuff's the beam's made out of is inpreg . . . heck, it's damned 
tough. As tough as some of the animals on Ragnoruk. And so it looks out 
of place here, where everything needs cleanin' and paintin' and . . . .

   "I was in love once."

   The little man's words surprise me. After a while, I shrug and say, 
"Tell me about it." I'm a sucker for a good story.

   "It was late and I'd just gotten off'n my shift. I'm the night 
watchman over at the Bell Tower . . . ."

   I grunt because I know that place. It used to be a bell tower, until 
they took the top off when they put in the first elevated. But it still 
needs watchin' and I guess that's what he does.

   "I'd stopped in a tav much like this place," he continues, "for my 
usual drink afore goin' on home." He swishes his glass a little and 
stares at the liquid goin' round 'n' round. I watch it, too.

   "Then I saw her." A far-away look creeps into his eyes. "She coulda 
stepped outter one of them beauty rags," he says, something glinting 
in his eyes.

   "Blonde, clean as the air in the Heritage District. She looked like 
she needed a friend, so I sat down across from her. She smiled at me."

   For the first time, the little man looks at me! As if I'm the girl of 
his dreams. I don't know what he's seeing, but it ain't me. Not now, not 
with the look he's giving me. I smile a little, back at him.

   "Yeah, like that," he says. "She pulls out a weed and offers me one. 
I don't usually smoke, but I figger one can't hurt. She puffs on hers and 
I take a drag on mine. It'd been years, but I still remembered how not to 
breathe it in. I let it out slowly and she blows a circle with hers.

   "Funny . . ." he says, drifting off. I look at him as he seems to slip 
somewhere out of time. Like it doesn't have any meaning for him. We sit 
there a minute, maybe two, I don't know. Time doesn't flow normally 
when it's like this.

   "We both enjoyed a drink and then I asked her if she's got any place 
to stay. She says she don't, so I offered my place."

   I raise an eyebrow at him.

   "She didn't say why, just that she'd like that. I don't know why."

   The little man looks at his drink and then takes a slow sip. Nice 
and easy, and I notice his hands. Gentle and kind. I think I understand 
what's goin' on. The girl's on the rocks. Sometimes we see them here in 
The Pits. And I guess that's kinda what he experienced.

   He puts down his drink and rubs his head. Wrinkles come and go as he 
rubs like he's rubbin' a headache away. He looks at me and shakes his 
head. "It was like a dream come true," he says, gettin' that far-away 
look again.

   "We walked from the tav to my place, 'bout a block and a half. It 
ain't much but it's all I have. I keep it clean and neat, no messy 
dishes or anything like that." He pauses, starin' off into space, like 
there's no tomorrow.

   He takes a deep breath. "I let her in ahead of me, and she turned to 
face me as I followed." A look of sadness crosses his eyes.

   "`Come here,' she told me. I didn't know quite what to do. She was 
beautiful, and she reached out for my hand. I took it and she pulled me 
gently to her."

   There's somethin' in his eye -- I can't tell what -- and he rubs it 
away before I can see it plainly.

   "God, what a body," he whispers. "So kind, so lovely, so wonderful. 
We kissed, then. Deep and long. Passionate like I've never been kissed 
or kissed since."

   "As we broke apart, I asked her if she wanted anything, like 
something to drink or eat. She told me that would be nice, so I got out 
some cheese and crackers. It's about the only thing I kept around. We 
shared and made a bunch of small talk."

   A bitterness crosses his lips. "She'd been battered, she had, by 
some sonofabitchin' spacer. I couldn't see nothin' until she raised 
her skirt and I got a good look at her legs. Bruises like you wouldn't 
believe."

   He takes another drink. "You ever been battered?" he asks.

   A chill runs down my back. Sure I have. What girl hasn't been, down 
here in The Pits? We get it and we see it. Nothin' new. Except maybe for 
him. His eyes tell me that he ain't one of them. There's a pain there 
that you can see but can't describe.

   The best I can do is shrug my answer and he nods. "I don't like it 
when a man beats a woman. It don't make him no man, it makes him a 
nothin' -- a Ragnorukian antworm."

   I know what he's talkin' about. A bug that is built like an ant, but 
drags its body behind it, oozin' out slime behind it, all along its 
trail. That's what he was talkin' about. A man that's got so low that 
he's an antworm -- someone that beats women.

   He continues, "I laid my hand over hers and she smiled at me. I don't 
know why she did that, but it made me feel whole. I wasn't empty no more."

   I just sit there and look at him.

   "Later that night I turned down the lights and undressed for bed. I 
could see her moving against the darkness. Graceful, like an angel. 
Maybe she was." His eyes look like their gettin' heavy, so I clear my 
throat and swallow. He nods a knowing nod.

   "I watched her," he confesses to me. "I watched her get undressed 
in the dark. She did it at the end of the bed, knowin' that I was 
watching her."

   I watch his eyes. They're deep and green. Gentle and kind -- no 
malice, no hatred -- no lust. He glances at me and I hastily look down.

   "She crawled into bed next to me all naked and warm. I could feel 
her warmth next to me. Dry and clean, like a newborn babe. I felt for 
her hand and found it. We held hands for a long time."

   I watch him as he swirls his drink again. His hands -- no callouses 
-- are just gentle hands, like his eyes.

   "Pretty soon, she drew my hand to her and asked me to rub her softly. 
I did, rubbing her back as she cuddled next to me, purring like some 
kitten in ecstasy. It didn't take her long before we really got together."

   He shakes his head and murmurs the words to an old, old song. "Her 
kisses were sweeter'n wine..."

   He's sittin' there for a long time, just starin' into emptiness. 
My heart goes out to him as he finishes his story.

   "I never felt so whole," he repeats. He's gentle and decent and 
don't go into the details of their love, but I know they did it. All 
natural and gentle as you please. You can see it in his face.

   He finishes his drink in one gulp, then sets down the glass. "The 
next morning, the sun was shinin'. That was before they built the city 
on top o' us. It had been rainin' the night afore, but now it was 
shinin' like nothing was wrong with the world.

   "I turned to her and found her gone. In her place was a six-word 
letter: `I've got to be movin' on.'"

   That's all he says. "I've got to be movin' on."

   His gentle eyes fill the room before me and his hands lay there 
empty. He's never felt so whole. What I would give to be like that.

   I've never been much of a looker, and I ain't had no men like him in 
a long, long time. I reach over and take his hand in mine, and slowly 
bring it to my lips. "I know I ain't much to look at," I tell him, "and 
I'm twenty years too old, but damn! I sure wish I was that girl."

   "Well that's okay," he replies, taking my other hand in his. "I don't 
mind at all. I'll wait around 'till you get off, then if you don't mind 
an old bachelor, why don't you come over and sit a spell."

   "I'd like that," I tell him and then give him a little smile -- just 
like I did some twenty years ago.

                                    FLEAS

                                        Copyright 1991, Adam Poszar.



              Fleas?  Yeah, we had 'em.  Whole darned town had 'em.
          Lady on the news said it was because of the weather.
          Don't know if I ought to believe her or not.

              The dog brought 'em in.

              The vet gave us some pills, for the dog that is.
          Didn't work.  Gave the dog a bath.  Dog had 'em the next
          day.

              My wife found one on her ankle.  "Least we got one of
          'em," I told her.   That made her grumpy AND jumpy.

              Went back to the vet, got some special flea-killing
          soap and gave the dog another bath.  That lasted 'bout two
          days.

              Went out and bought fifty dollars worth of chemical
          stuff and bombed the house.  Didn't see a single one, for
          almost a week.

              I found a couple, one was on my foot, the other was on
          my wrist.  I wasn't quick enough.  One of 'em got away.

              Got to where we were smackin' places that felt like
          fleas whether there were fleas there or not.

              Gave the dog another bath, again with the special
          soap, sprayed it with some special kind of poison spray
          the vet sold us, and put a sure-kill flea collar on it.
          Oh yeah, and we got sixty dollars more in chemicals and
          bombed the house again.

              We watched nervously for two weeks.

              Now I admit we were pretty jumpy by then.  There were
          a couple of nights when I woke up 'cause my wife was
          scratchin' herself in her sleep.  I never said anything to
          her 'cause she was scratching places that we very rarely
          discussed.

              I'd even gotten to slapping myself when I was at work.
          It wouldn't have been so bad except that we both have
          freckles.

              'Bout halfway through the second week, the dog's hair
          started falling out.  At least it made it easier to find
          the fleas when they came back.

              Less that a month ago we got rid of the dog.  It
          looked like a sixty-pound Chihuahua by then anyway.






              And we bombed the house again, this time with over a
          hundred dollars worth of stuff.  It's been a month and a
          half since, and we haven't seen a single flea.

              This morning I got up early, made coffee, and took a
          cup up to my wife.  She was still asleep.

              I set the cup down real careful, so's not to spill
          any.  I leaned across the bed and gave her a big kiss.

              She smiled, opened her eyes, reached up, and slapped
          me in the face so hard I almost saw stars!

              "Sorry Honey," she said, "I guess it was just a
          freckle."

William Burroughs -- A Sketch
John C. Kramer, M.D. Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry,
   University of California of Medicine, Irvine, California 92717.

William Burroughs -- A Sketch
  John C. Kramer, M.D.



Late in July 1978 I spent an afternoon with William Burroughs at his summer
apartment in Boulder, Colorado. We were to talk together and record our
discussion on tape. It would be the starting point for a chapter of a book.

The conversations are from the transcript of the tape. They are much
abbreviated; phrasing and words have often been changed and are not
necessarily in the order they occurred.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Photo deleted. -- Dr. Rat]

The light was too dim when the photo of Bill Burroughs was taken. The
shutter speed was slow, probably 1/15 of a second, and the camera moved.
The picture is irretrievably blurred. And the negative was stored roiled
up. There are fine cracks all over, like in an old oil painting. But it's
him. No doubt about it. The look could be called sad or grim. It really
looks like Bill Burroughs.

He wouldn't say anything about what he was writing now. Maybe he wasn't
writing anything, just taking it easy and didn't want to say so. But maybe
he just didn't want to talk about it.

Considering the language in his books you'd never know it when he talked.
He was like a near-retirement State Department man I'd once met -- eastern,
good school accent, just loud enough to hear and sometimes not. Courtly.
Good manners, not in a formal discomfort-making way, but so that you felt
you never could do anything wrong.

His place wasn't what I expected. A student apartment. Usual furniture.
Areas: kitchen area; eating area; living-room area. No hall to speak of.
Two bedrooms and bath. Books and magazines neatly stacked. Boy lives there.
Almost certainly plans to be a writer. Cobble Hardy. Good name for a
writer.

People entered, talked, left. Bright lady who wondered who I was. Probably
partly a collector of famous people. Didn't show disappointment when she
found out who I wasn't. Two young sisters knocked. Their mommy wanted her
pot back. My breath caught a notch watching what Burroughs was taking from
the kitchen. It was a pot. He wished he could have kept it a little longer.

Richard Evans Schultes' name came up. Burroughs said, @@Know him well. We
took a trip to South America together. He has a definite disagreement with
the attempt to eradicate cocaine there. He says that it doesn't hurt them
at all. That's what Dick Schultes says. I think it must cut off the
circulation in the gums. That's what does it. Teeth fall out. It's a
disgusting habit, I think. Just physically. I tried it. All it did is
freeze up my mouth. No systemic effect. It seems like a waste of time to
me.''

@@Have you ever shot coke?''

@@Good heavens, yes. Lots of it. When I was on junk. With heroin.''

@@Speedball.''

@@Yeah. When I take it alone it makes me too nervous.''

@@What role did junk, opiates, play in your life as a writer?''

@@My experience as an addict was very useful to me as writer: the whole
syndrome of addiction and withdrawal and the extensions of that and other
forms of addiction. It gave me a great deal of material. A writer can
profit by something that someone else may not be able to profit from at
all. Yet they were very disagreeable experiences. Very boring
experiences.''

Was that all there was to Burroughs' junkie life -- material for novels?
@@Okay, it was important in the sense that it provided material. But did it
do something to your soul?'' The question was real but it couldn't be said
with too much intensity. Then it would sound melodramatic.

Burroughs, laughingly, @@That's a metaphysical question.''

@@Of course it is.''

@@The whole experience of addiction and withdrawal does change people in
some ways. Any basic experience is like that, like being in prison for a
long time. Nobody who hasn't been there knows what it means. It does make
some changes, yes.''

Burroughs' first book was  Junkie . Later books were surrealist extensions
of that realistic biographical novel. Addiction gave him the impetus as
well as the material. I didn't follow up on the idea of @@impetus.'' I
should have. Instead I told him how I had found something deadly honest in
the addicts I had known, at least when you didn't have the power to give or
withhold anything from them. Falseness, it seemed to me, had been burned
away. Was this what had happened to Burroughs?

He agreed. @@Addiction... the mere fact of addiction does put someone in
touch with certain fundamentals. It's something you can't deny; it's there
and it gives you a sense of reality that maybe you would not have without
it. I've always said that maybe if schizophrenics were addicted to opiates
it would get them out of their catatonia. You would say, @well, you won't
move -- now there it is, over there, go and get it.' I've never seen an
addict schizophrenic when he was on junk. They've got to be in touch with
reality. At least enough to get the drugs and administer them.''

But whatever else it did for schizophrenia, junk didn't carry them much
beyond sanity. @@Addicts are,'' he said with finality, @@as boring a bunch
of people as I ever encountered. They've got this one track mind.''

@@Scoring and fixing.''

@@Drearily.''

I recall being told that they sat and stared at T.V. for hours. Burroughs
sighed, @@That they do. Billie Holiday said that she knew she was cured
when she stopped looking at T.V.''

Dr. John Yerbury Dent, gone now these several years, was the one that
William Burroughs says cured him of his addiction. Did it with apomorphine.
Its chemical structure is very much like morphine but different enough that
the nauseating effect is emphasized. But it isn't the nauseating effect
that does the job, Burroughs says, but that it is a metabolic stabilizer.
He doesn't understand why it hasn't been more widely used.

Old Doc Dent was great. Had some marvelous stories. He was strictly for
voluntary treatment only. Burroughs liked Dent for this, but it was still
the apomorphine and only the apomorphine that did the job for him. Maybe
so.

Thunder and a sudden deluge punctuated the Colorado afternoon. Lipton tea,
sugar, no milk. Lemon? Sorry, no lemon.

Other junkie writers. Coleridge. De Quincey -- his confessions told the
story with precision. I always thought so. Good to hear it from Burroughs
-- Bill.

What about psychedelics?

@@Well, cannabis is useful. When you're stuck and don't know where you're
going you smoke cannabis and then you see four or five ways the narrative
can go. No one is going to become a writer from taking any of these drugs
but they can get beneficial material from them.

@@I don't like any of the stronger psychedelics. I would never take LSD...
I hate it.''

@@You've tried it?'' (Obviously.)

@@I've tried it. I just hate it. I don't like the feeling.... It makes me
nervous. My coordination isn't good and there's a metallic taste in my
mouth and there's nothing I like about it. I've taken mescaline,
psilocybin. The only one I've been able to use with consistency is
cannabis.''

@@Has anything useful come to you with mescaline or psilocybin?''

@@Yes, but mostly of an unpleasant nature. There is one interesting one
though, yage', but I've never been able to get any since I left South
America. There's  Banisteriopsis  in it; that's the main ingredient but not
the only one. The medicine men use it to potentiate their powers, to locate
lost objects and that kind of thing. But I'm not impressed much by their
performance. Everybody has telepathic experiences all the time. These
things are not rare. It's just an integral part of life. The faculty is
probably increased to some extent by any consciousness expanding drug.''

We talked dope talk some more. Opium smoking and opium dreams. Life in
Morocco and how it was the old people, not the young ones, who smoked
cannabis. And about majoun, marijuana candy. And I told him about khat in
Arabia. And he told me about the lies that Anslinger spread. And we told
each other about Hasan-i-Sabah and how the  haschischins  were not driven
to murder because they were stoned. And he got back to his apomorphine
stories.

And then we talked about writing. Burroughs was turned on to his style
through a suggestion of his friend, Brion Gysin, a painter. Gysin had said
that writing was 50 years behind painting. What Burroughs decided was to
apply the montage method to writing.

@@That would be,'' he said, @@actually closer to the facts of perception
than would, say, a sequential narrative. For example, you walk down the
street. You see it and you put it on canvas. That's what they did first.
But that's not how you really see it or remember it. It's more jumbled.
There are the street signs and the vendors and the houses and people
walking. You don't see them like a photograph. You look at diverse images.
Painting it that way is montage. I merely applied it to writing. So there's
nothing very new there.''

@@Do you rearrange with great thought or do you toss it up in the air and
however it comes down...?''

@@Both. You get a random factor. Your choice comes in what you use.''

@@If it doesn't sound right you toss it out and try again?''

@@Yeah. You see the random factor in life every time you look out the
window or walk down the street. Your consciousness is being continually cut
by random factors. I try to make this explicit by taking words and cutting
them up. That's what happens all the time anyway. That's my theory about
art. Art is making you aware of what you know and don't know you know. That
is, the actual facts of perception.

@@When Cezanne's paintings were first exhibited people didn't realize that
this was an apple, that was a pear, seen from a certain angle. They were so
upset they actually attacked the canvasses with umbrellas. Now, anybody,
any child, would know what it is.

@@The same way Joyce made people aware of their own streams of
consciousness... on one level, that is. Consciousness is much more complex
than that. Now we don't feel that Joyce is at all unintelligible.''

@@Didn't Joyce spend a hell of a lot of time putting complex phrases
together, each with several meanings?''

@@No doubt about that. He spent 20 years on  Finnegan's Wake . It's very
difficult to read.''

I raised the question of hearing versus reading. which registered better?
Bill said he had given 60 or 70 readings in the past few years and that
some things read well and some didn't. Fitzgerald, he thought, was better
left on paper.

Enough about writing. Burroughs wanted to talk about endorphins, those
natural morphine-like molecules, and about opiates in invertebrates. I
would send him what I had, I said.

How about some pictures? Fine. Don't you ever smile, Bill? A grin flashed
out, lingered and faded.

Tea time was over. Cocktail time was here. Gin and tonic? Sure.

Another.

And another.

In kitchen tumblers. A couple of ice cubes. No lime.

The pictures came out blurry. (Like a first impression?) There hadn't been
enough light and exposure time was slow. But one of them worked out. Blurs,
cracks and all, it looked like Bill.

 He 's just my Bill   An ordinary guy ...

You ain't no ordinary guy, Bill.

        This file was inspired by my experiences at a local supermarket today.  The names and events have been slightly altered to protect the innocent.

-----------------------


        ABCO - There it was in big, red letters above the store.  I fought past the polyester_clad hordes and made my way into the market.  Upon entering, the smell of rotting fruit and decaying meat met my nostrils - my kind of store.  I pulled out my shopping list from my jeans and proceeded to acquire myself a nifty cart.  Of course, the one I got had a wheel that wouldn't spin.  I went to an aisle to get the first item on my shopping list - stuffing.  While perusing the multitude of Stove Top Stuffing (c) flavors, a tiny waif of a child strolled up next to me.  I edged away from this odiferous, dribbling mass of flesh and continued with my stuffing selection.  While reaching for "FINE TURKEY FLAVOR" I heard a whisper:

        "Psssst!  Bobby!  Get away from there!"

I look at little Bobby, then I turn around.  There was Bobby's yuppie_mother.  She stood their clad in her reeboks and guess jeans (40 and trying to look 14) with a mixed look of disgust and fear upon her face.  Again, the whisper:

        "NOW BOBBY! NOW! MOVE YOUR ASS!"

        "But mom!"

        She held her breath, then quickly walked over and grabbed Bobby by his arm and dragged him away.  Noticing her unusual intake of oxygen, I sniffed.  Sure enough, the strong, sweet, smoky odor of bud_ez were floating up from my jacket.  Oh my.  She probably thought I was going to deal drugs to her child.  I grabbed a can of green beans and exclaimed:

        "Hey, wait!  You forgot something!"

        I threw the can with all my might.  The can sailed lazily through the air, spinning slowly towards its final destination - the back of Bobby's little head.  With a pleasant cracking sound, the can went halfway into his head before stopping.  Bobby's entire body was thrown forward from the impact of the can.  His mother screamed out loud as she looked at him lying on the floor in his blood and brains.  

        "Dude. Boge!  Sorry lady.  I get these spasms some times.  You know, FROM DRUGS!!! AAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!"

        "YOU BASTARD!!!! MY SOOOOOOOON! MY SOOOOOOON!"

a message from the pa system interrupted her screaming:

        "Herb, clean-up in aisle 6."

        Wondering what an Herb looked like, I decided to stick around.  Sure enough, there was Herb - along with his 4" thick glasses, pocket protector, and flare_bottoms.  

        "Hi Herb!  Will you be my friend?" I asked him as I mashed the side of his head in with a box of stove top.  I took his lack of reply as a "no" answer.  Slightly angred, I reached into his pants and ripped his penis off - which I lobbed at Bobby's still screaming mother.  It landed with a nice <splat> at her feet, spraying her with blood and matter.  She looked at the severed member on the floor and a bizarre look came upon her face.  She licked her lips, then started to remove her sweatshirt.  Yep, she was definitely undressing.  Off came the sweatshirt, then her shoes, and jeans.  By now, our little aisle had attracted some attention.  All eyes had left me and focused on the now-nude mother of Bobby.  

        I noticed the moisture beginning to form on the red lips of her shaved vagina as she sat down on the floor.  She stretched and spread her legs - then took the limp, bleeding dick in a hand.  With her other hand, she spread her cunt apart, then slid in the dead dildo.  The eyes of the people watching her opened in surprise and shock as she began to moan in pleasure as she slid it in and out of herself.  

        Suddenly, several male on-lookers took their pants off and lunged for the wench upon the ground.  Bored, I paid for my box of stuffing (half-price because of the blood and dents in it) and left.  As the automatic door slid open and I walked out, I could hear Bobby's mother exclaim:

        "Oh yes!  Use the watermelon! Use the watermelon!"

                            DOPEY DENNIS

Once upon a time, there was a little boy called Dennis. Everyone called him 
Dopey because . . . well, read on and you will see why. Dennis lived with his 
mother in a nice house with a courtyard, vegetable plot, cellar and a henrun. 
One day his mother, since she had to go shopping, said to him,
   "I'll be away for an hour or two, son. Now, the broody hen is sitting on 
her eggs. Make sure nobody goes near her. Keep the house tidy and don't touch 
the jar in the cupboard, it's full of poison."
   "Don't worry, Mum," the little boy said, and when his mother had gone, he 
went into the yard to keep guard over the broody hen. However, tired of 
sitting, the hen got up to stretch her legs for a little before going back to 
the eggs. Dennis picked up a stick and yelled:
   "You nasty creature, get right back on those eggs!"
   But the broody hen, annoyed, only said, "Cluck!", and so Dennis hit her 
with his stick. He didn't really mean to do her any harm, but the blow fell on
the middle of her neck and the poor hen dropped dead.
   "Oh!" gasped the lad. "Who's going to sit on the eggs now? Well, I had 
better do something about that!" So he sat on the eggs . . . and broke the 
lot! Getting up with the seat of his trousers sticky with egg yolk, Dennis 
said to himself, "Mum will give me such a scolding. But to keep in her good 
books, I'll give her a surprise, I'll make the lunch." He picked up the hen, 
plucked its feathers and put it on the spit to roast.
   "A roast calls for a good wine!" he said to himself. He took a jug and went
down to the cellar where he started to draw sparkling red wine from a barrel. 
"Mum will be pleased with me," he told himself. At that moment, there was a 
dreadful noise in the kitchen. Dennis said to himself, "Who can that be? I 
must go and see." And he went . . . forgetting to turn off the tap on the 
barrel.
   Up he ran to the kitchen and saw the cat with the roast hen in its jaws and
the spit overturned. "Hey thief!" shouted the lad. "Put my hen down!" He 
picked up a rolling pin and started to chase the cat which, terrified as it 
was, firmly held on to the roast chicken as it dashed from room to room. The 
pair of them knocked against the cupboards, overturned tables, sideboards and 
stools, smashed vases, pots, plates and glasses. The devastation ended when 
the cat dropped the hen, leapt out of a window and vanished from sight. Dennis
picked up his roast, laid it on the table and said:
   "Now, I'll go and fetch the wine." He went back to the cellar . . . which 
was flooded with the wine that had poured out of the barrel. "Good gracious!" 
gasped Dennis. "What am I to do now?" He didn't dare go in, for before him 
streched a lake of red wine.
   "I'll have to mop it all up," muttered Dennis to himself, "but how? I could
go into the yard and get some sacks of sand, bring them into the cellar and 
scatter the sand over the floor . . . But that's much too hard work. I'd 
better think of something else, now then . . ." Seated on the bottom step, his
elbows on his knees, holding his head in his hands, the lad tried to think of 
a good idea. It really was an alarming situation: there were nearly six inches
of wine all over the floor and in it floated corks, bottles and bits of 
wood . . .
   "I've got it!" Dennis suddenly exclaimed. He picked up one of the bags 
lying on a table, opened it . . . and started to scatter all the flour it 
contained. "Splendid! The flour will absorb the wine and I can walk about the 
cellar without wetting my feet," he cried.
   In no time at all, he had spread not one but five bags of good flour on the
floor. In the end, the floor was covered with a wine-coloured, soft, sticky 
paste, and as he walked on it, it stuck to his shoes. Dennis went to get the 
jug he had filled and carried it in great delight back to the table, leaving 
red footprints everywhere.
   "Mum is going to be really pleased," he said.
   Nevertheless, when he thought of all the mess he had made, he began to fear
a scolding and maybe punishment too. "Never mind," he said, "I'll drink the 
poison and die." So he went to the cupboard and picked up the jar. He thought 
the poison would be a black liquid, but the jar contained a red cream. He 
picked up a spoon and said, "I'll eat it then instead of drinking it."
   Just as he was about to take his first spoonful, he realised how silly he 
was. Nobody should ever eat poison, not even when your name is Dopey Dennis. 
Instead, he decided to hide from his mother so that she would not be able to 
punish him.
   A quarter of an hour later, his mother returned. When she saw the 
overturned furniture, the broken plates and the red footprints, she got a 
fright and cried, "Dennis! What has happened? Where are you? Answer me!"
   There was no reply, but she suddenly noticed a pair of legs sticking out of
the oven.
   "I'm not surprised you are hiding from me, Dennis, after causing all this 
mess," she said. "Well, while I am clearing up after you, you can take this 
roll of cloth to the market and try and sell it for a good price." And she 
handed the boy a roll of cloth as she spoke. "Oh, I will," said Dennis. "Leave
it to me."
   When he got to market, Dennis began to shout, "Cloth! Who'll buy this 
lovely cloth?" Several women came over and asked him,
   "What kind of cloth is it? Is it soft? Is it hard-wearing? Is it dear? How 
long is it? How much does it cost"? Dennis exclaimed:
   "You talk too much, and I don't sell things to chatterboxes," and off he 
went. He passed by a statue and mistook it for a fine gentleman, so he asked 
it, "Sir, would you like to buy this fine cloth? Yes or no? If you don't say 
anything, that means you do. Look here! Do you like it? Yes? Good! Then take 
it," and he left the cloth beside the statue and went home.  
   "Mum! Mum!" he cried. "I've sold the cloth to a very well-dressed 
gentleman!" The woman asked:
   "How much did he give you for it?" Dennis muttered,
   "Oh! I forgot to ask him for the money! Don't worry, I'll go and ask him 
for it." He ran back to the statue but the cloth had gone. Someone had clearly
taken it away. Said Dennis to the statue, "I see you've taken the cloth home 
already. Fine, now give me the money!" Of course, the statue did not reply. 
Dennis repeated his request, then losing his temper, he picked up a stick and 
began to beat the statue about the head . . . which broke off and rolled to 
the ground. Out of the head poured a handful of gold coins, hidden there by 
goodness knows who! Dennis picked up the coins, put the head back in position 
and went home.
   "Look!" he called. And his mother stared in astonishment at this small 
fortune.
   "Who gave you such a good price?" his mother asked him. The lad replied:
   "A very dignified-looking gentleman. He didn't speak, and do you know where
 he kept his money? In his head!" At this, Dennis's mother exclaimed:
   "Dennis, listen! You killed the broody hen, broke the eggs, flooded the 
cellar with wine, wasted five bags of flour, smashed plates, bottles, vases 
and glasses; you nearly ate the cream, if you think you're going to pull my 
leg as well you're badly mistaken! Get out of here!" And grabbing the broom, 
she chased him out of the house.
   "I don't want to see you again till tonight! Off you go into the vegetable 
plot." But, as the boy was sitting on the doorstep and did not budge, his 
exasperated mother picked up the first thing that came within her grasp and 
hurled it at Dennis's head. It was a big basket of dried figs and sultanas. 
Dennis shouted then:
   "Mum! Mum! Quick! Bring a bag! It's raining dry figs and sultanas!" His 
mother slumped into a chair and said sorrowfully:
   "What can I do with a boy like him?"
   Now, since Dennis went about telling folk he had a lot of gold coins, the 
magistrates sent for him. "Where did you find those coins?" they asked him. Dennis replied: 
   "A gentleman gave me them in payment for a roll of cloth." 
   "What gentleman?" said the magistrates severely. 
   "The gentleman that is always standing at the corner of Plane Tree Street 
and Jasmine Road," replied the boy. 
   "But that's a statue!" gasped the magistrates. Dennis said: 
   "He didn't say what his name was, but maybe it is Mr. Statue. He kept his 
money in his head." The magistrates gaped at each other in utter astonishment.
Then the chief magistrate asked: 
   "Tell us, Dennis, when did you do this piece of business?" 
   "It was the day it rained dry figs and sultanas!" the boy replied. Again 
the magistrates exchanged looks, and now certain that Dennis really was dopey,
they said: 
   "You can go home, lad, you're free!" 
   And so Dennis went home and lived there happily with his mother. A bit 
dopey, yes, but he never did anybody any harm, and that's all that counts.

                    THE TAIL OF THE BEAR

   Once upon a time there lived a fisherman who earned a living selling fish, 
making his rounds to the customers on a horse-drawn cart loaded with his catch
of the day.
   One cold winter day, while the fisherman was crossing the woods, a fox 
smelled the fish and began following the cart at a close distance. The 
fisherman kept his trout in long wicker baskets and the sight of the fish made
the fox's mouth water. The fox, however, was reluctant to jump on the cart to 
steal a fish because the fisherman had a long whip that he cracked from time 
to time to spur on the horse. But the smell of fresh fish was so enticing that
the fox overcame her fear of the whip, leapt on to the cart and with a quick 
blow of her paw, dropped a wicker basket on the snow. The fisherman did not 
notice anything and continued his journey undisturbed.
   The fox was very happy. She opened the basket and got ready to enjoy her 
meal. She was about to taste the first bite when a bear appeared.
   "Where did you get all that marvellous trout?" the big bear asked with a 
hungry look on its face.
   "I've been fishing," the fox answered, unperturbed.
   "Fishing? How? The lake is frozen over," the bear said, incredulously. "How
did you manage to fish?"
   The fox was aware that, unless she could get rid of the bear with some kind
of excuse, she would have had to share her fish. But the only plausible answer
she could come up with was:
   "I fished with my tail."
   "With your tail?" said the bear, who was even more astonished.
   "Sure, with my tail. I made a hole in the ice, I dropped my tail in the 
water and when I felt a bite I pulled it out and a fish was stuck on its end,"
the fox told the bear. The bear touched his tail and his mouth began watering.
He said:
   "Thanks for the tip. I'm going fishing too."
   The lake was not too far away, but the ice was very thick and the bear had 
a hard time making a hole in it. Finally, his long claws got the job done. As 
time went by and evening approached, it got colder and colder. The bear 
shivered but he kept sitting by the hole with his tail in the water. No fish 
had bitten yet.
   The bear was very cold and the water of the lake began freezing again 
around his tail. It was then that the bear felt something like a bite on the 
end of his frozen tail. The bear pulled with all his strength, heard something
tear and at the same time felt a very sharp pain. He turned around to find out
what kind of fish he had caught, and right then he realized that his tail, 
trapped in the ice, had been torn off.
   Ever since then, bears have had a little stump instead of a long and thick 
tail.

A Peace Song

Last nite I had the strangest
 dream I never dreamed before.
I dreamed the world had all
 agreed To put an end to war.
I dreamed I saw a mighty room
 All filled with women + men, And
the paper they were signing said
 They'd never fight again.
  And when the paper was all
   signed and a million copies
   made.  They all joined hands
   and bowed their heads
  And grateful prayers were
   prayed.
  And the people in the
   streets below
   were dancing round and round
  While guns and swords
   and uniforms
  Were scattered on the ground.

                            Lionbirds
                    by Martin R. Crim (1994)

This is the rationalist view:
     The lionbird is a species of eagle which travels and hunts
in prides.  Prides take prey of all sizes from pigeons to bison,
and also eat carrion.  Each pride has a king, or alpha male,
several subordinate males, and many females.  Many young males
leave the pride to travel in bachelor packs, and eventually join
prides other than those of their birth.  Their secretive breeding
habits have led to the legend that they hatch their eggs in
heaven.  This legend is disproved by the occasional sighting of a
lionbird in Fire Season, when they supposedly are all in heaven. 
Their plumage is tawny.  Males have golden crests, and the king
always has the largest crest in the pride.  Kings live only a
year, worn out by monopolizing the mating.  Lionbirds have a
group song, sometimes heard by humans, which is alien but
rhythmic.

This is the theistic view:
     The lionbird is one of the oldest children of Vrok.  It was
one of the favorites of Murharzarm and he often hunted with it. 
The lionbird pride emulates the divine order of Yelm, with a
king, several subordinates, and males over females.  The male's
golden crest is a special blessing from Vrok, and sign of his
favor.  It is regicide to kill a king lionbird, ignoble to slay
any male lionbird, and bad luck even to disturb a pride.
     The sky gods use lionbirds as messengers to mortals, for
they travel to the sky once a year, in Fire Season.  Outlaw birds
must remain behind on the earth.  When the prides reach heaven,
old kings retire there forever.  One male in each pride finds the
divine meal which makes him the new king.  The females bear the
new king's eggs and hatch them near the end of Fire Season.  The
eggs are gold in color, but not metallic.  Fed on fire berries
and the meat of heavenly animals, the young grow fast.  At the
end of Fire Season, the females push the young out of their
nests, and the fledglings must learn to fly as they plummet
toward the earth.  The pride follows, calling out instructions to
the young ones.  Those who learn to fly join the pride.  Those
who do not, plunge into the sea.  This represents the virtue of
Justice.
     The lionbirds sing, representing the virtue of Harmony. 
Their song often reveals messages from heaven to those with the
wisdom to understand.  To hear their song is a blessing, and
bound to bring the same joy of the heart which the sun brings
when he bursts through clouds.
     Sheng Seleris was accompanied in much of his career by a
pride of lionbirds who brought him messages from the sky gods. 
They sang to him each morning, and he interpreted their songs to
his companions.  Other solar heroes, mostly of the Golden and
Silver Ages, had friendly lionbird prides. 
     Lionbird feathers are good for many Light, Fire, Harmony,
Life, and Death magics.  Crest feathers are best.  Pentian kings
need lionbird feathers for their head-dresses.

This is the game view:
Lionbirds are medium-sized eagles.  Their keen sight and high
intelligence would make them good familiars and allied spirits,
but they grow lonely away from their pride and sometimes pine
away and die.  A lone bird lives no more than five years in
captivity, less if caged or wing-clipped.  Allying an entire
pride is possible, if one gains the friendship of the king. 
However, the whole pride then flies away in late Sea Season.  The
king does not return, so neither does the pride (in most cases).
     An adventurer can use Falconry (a/k/a Hawking) to train a
lionbird.  Training is easier if the trainer wears a yellow
feather crest on his hat or helm.  The lionbird song is
instinctive, however, and training cannot change it.  Using
Falconry on a king lionbird carries a 50 percentile penalty.
     The statistics below are for an average male, which is about
.8 meters long, beak to talons, and has a 2 meter wingspan (about
the size of a bald eagle).  The king has a SIZ of 4 (1.1 meters
long and 3 meter wingspan--the size of a California Condor).  The
king has a STR of 18 and INT of 5, and POW above 12.  Average
females are .7 meters long, with a 1.8 meter wingspan and STR
2D6+4, but are otherwise the same as average males.  The smallest
young observed are SIZ 2 (.6 meters long, 1.5 meter wingspan).

Note: Lionbirds Dive to kill small prey or to wound larger prey. 
Lionbirds attack large foes (SIZ 4 and up) in a group, with some
distracting the foe while others Dive and then claw and peck. 
The distraction subtracts 5% from the target's skills for each
lionbird in the attacking group, up to 75%.  Each lionbird that
closes gets a Dive attack.  If the prey does not effectively
attack back, the lionbird stays near it and gets Claw and Peck
attacks in the next round.  If the prey tries to attack back, the
Lionbird wheels away, climbs, and gets another Dive attack on the
sixth round after the last Dive.  Lionbirds never suffer a damage
penalty for STR + SIZ when using natural weapons.

Skills: Dodge 80+19, Scan 100-6, Search 100-6.
Armor: 1 point feathers on abdomen, chest, and head.


Random note: The mongols used Golden Eagles to hunt wolves, and
the weight to strength ratio of raptors is much higher than
represented in the RQ rules.  Change the Hawk stats on page 24 of
the RQ Creatures Book to STR 2D6+2 for hawks and STR 2D6+5 for
eagles.  The strength of raptors is concentrated in their talons
and flight muscles, however, and a normal human could wrestle one
pretty easily as long as he guarded against the beak and talons.=========================================================================================

     It was dawn.  The sunlight tore through the open window and burned the 
tiny eyes of the infant girls squirming on the bottom of the crib.  Their bald
pussylips moist with fresh urine, drained from their cunts after hours of 
sucking on mommies tits.  They started to cry, stomachs were empty, it's feed-
ing time.  Th heat was unbearable, our diapers are wet!  Goddamnit, bitch!
Where the fuck are you..?  Stayed out late at GlamFags, picking up poseres..?
What about us, you sleazy gashmonster..?!?  Well, it wasn't a good night for 
mom.  After going home with a guy wearing hairspray and lace, she was horribly
raped and beaten by several women wearing strap-on dildos.  They injected her
with LSD.  She was not herself.  She woke up in a garbage can, her crotch was
soaking wet with blood.  As she stumbled home, she saw a pigeon, feeding it's 
young.  As the tiny birds opened their beaks, the bird regurgitated into the 
eager mouths of her children.  Children ( Don't I have TWO children ).  The 
sight made her ill, but at the same time, it got her wet.  Kicking the door
open, she found two thrashing infants, screaming loud enough to wake the evil
dead.  She saw the pee streaming down their legs ( Oh, my clit ) from old 
diapers not properly fastened.  She ripped the smelly rags off her babies and
stuck two fingers up each of their pink pussies.  The shrill of their cries
was so loud it made her dizzy.  Breaking the crib wall off, she dived in and
licked the blood and piss off the twin's thighs until her own pussy was 
reaming.  The taste of the girl's vaginal excretion made her ill.  Realizing
they haven't had breakfast, she grabs one of the girls, wraps her mouth around
the child's and pukes last nights pizza down her tiny throat.  The baby kicked
and let out muffled cries as she spasmed from the choaking.  Liquid excrement
sprayed all over mom's cunt.  She could almost smell the strained peas in her 
runs.  Scooing up the wet shit in her hand, she drops the dead body and turns
to the other girl.  She hungrily licked and surped up the feces out of her 
palm.  The remaining girl ( watch the infant die ) closed her eyes, preparing 
for her unspeakable demise.  Mom gulped down the shit and turnd to her remain
ing child.  She let out a final scream as mom grabbed her face and forced her
jaw open.  Eyes watering, brown fluid drooling out her mouth, she embraces
'precious'..

                                        New Story
=========================================================================================
Be a CLERK all my life?  NOT ME!

     I work at temporary jobs in different offices in various departments at
a University.  The jobs can last anywhere from 1 day to a number of months
and pay from five-something to nine-something an hour.  The moronic robot
ones pay the lowest.  Usually jobs are centered around a telephone and/or
computer screen.  I worked in Custodial Services for a few weeks.  At this
job I'd get calls from people who were usually upset and in the midst of a
problem requiring custodial services; like spilled coffee on the floor,
cobwebs on the ceiling or piss on the toilet seat.  Ah, the University.
Sometimes I'd get actual 'emergency' calls like when somebody puked on the
side of a building or smoke alarms that kept "enunciating" or a bigwig
locked out of his (or her) office.  It was my job to keep log of these
things and send the proper custodians out to remedy the situation: One day
I got an interesting call from OB-GYN (Obstetrics- Gynecology). They needed
a janitor to clean the "sperm collection room".  Visions of a young Don
Johnson hooked up to a mechanical sperm extracting device went through my
mind. "A Boy And His Dog", remember? The caller said that the room hadn't
been cleaned for awhile and was very much in need of custodial services. 
She advised me to have them disinfect the doorknob and to tell them not to
touch magazines.  Yech!  Who would want to?!
     I end up making lots of photocopies at some of my jobs.  This is good
as it familiarizes me with different machines and their functions plus I can
sometime get some of my own stuff done.  Another thing I sometimes do is
distribute campus mail.  I like this.  I have so an affinity with mail and
the campus mailing system is quite awesome.  The best thing is that it
requires no postage to send any size package from one university department
to another.  If you have friends in other departments it's easy to send and
receive things via campus mail.  Another good thing is that probably 99% of
the envelopes circulating through campus mail are 'recycled', in that they
are used over and over again.  Another mode of communication used by the
university is fax.  Fax is fuckin' far out!  I got faxed by MR. NOSE once!
Fax is tricky.  My first fax took four tries before I finally got it out.
Sadly it was only going about four blocks away.  And ironically it was an ad
for a job as campus recycler.  Is fax paper recyclable?  I often end up with
equipment that is mine to use as long as I'm at a particular job; like desk,
stapler, tape dispenser, telephone, computer, colored pens, etc.  This makes
me feel good for some reason.  It's a little strange but I've always gotten
charge out of office supply stores, probably the way some people feel about
hardware stores or auto parts shops.  Another thing I've got is e-mail
(electronic mail)-communication via computer screen.  It's too cool.  I love
it; you've got the creativity of the written word with the convenience and
efficiency of the spoken.  It's that fast.
     I worked at the Dean of Medicine's satellite office once for a while.
One of my duties there was to type information into a "database".  The
papers I got the information from were called "evals".  I called them
"evils".  They were evaluations filled out by health care workers (doctors
mostly) after they'd attended medical conferences, usually held in places
like Tahoe, Maui or Las Vegas, etc. (you get the idea).  Through the
anonymous 'evals" the conference attendees could make comments on and
ratings of speakers, services, facilities, skiing, surfing, whatever.
There were a couple of interesting things about these evaluations: one being
the titles of some of the lectures like, 'Morbid Obesity - A 480 lb. Woman'
or 'Gangrene In The Arm Of A 52-Year Old Farmer' or 'A Light Touch -
retrieving a Lightbulb From The Anus Of A 28-Year Old Man'.  The other
interesting thing was the "comments" section.  Anonymity can turn some
people into real jerks.  I felt bad just typing up some of their vicious and
cutting remarks.  After a couple of days of this I started doing some
editing.  At first just toning down a bit on some of the real scathing
things and then after another couple of days, I started adding a few of my
own "comments' amidst the rest; nice stuff though, like 'should be more
women lecturers", "it'd be nice to have some sort of recycling facilities or
receptacles available", "more fruit and juices at luncheon would be good".
I felt like a high-tech Robin Hood.
     Usually the jobs that sound the most important are the most boring.  I
especially hate the ones where there's nothing to do but look at the clock
and try to look busy and purposeful.  Another plus about working in the
university system is that the dress code is generally fairly lax.  I'm not
sure if this is because of the academic affiliation or if it's the civil
service proletarian mind-set but I'm not complaining.  Unfortunately in the
past two years they've made it so a 'temp' can only work a certain amount of
hours per year.  So far this hasn't affected me too adversely and there's
generally always work when I want (need) it.  I guess that 'temps' are
probably looked down upon in some circles and people are sometimes
suspicious of our lifestyles.  But what the hell, if you're of a certain
temperament (pardon the pun), it's a pretty good way to make a living and
have a life at the same time.

   Jayne should devote an entire issue of JAYNE'ZINE to an examination of her
jobs, past and present.  It's really quite amazing how interesting another 
person's dull and dead-end jobs seem to be when viewed from the safety of a
distance.  Not to imply that Jayne's jobs are such, just that the drugery of
others is such a facinating subject; if only we could be as objective about
our own forms of slave-wage earning, perhaps they wouldn't seem quite so
tedious.  Then again... :)

                       THE WEEPING PRINCESS

   Once upon a time . . . a greedy emperor forced his subjects to pay heavy 
taxes. Not only the poor were squeezed, but the nobles in this immense empire 
were highly taxed too. At last, tired of being crushed by taxes, the nobles 
held a protest meeting. When the emperor heard about this, he took fright for 
he feared a rebellion. So he sent out this proclamation to put an end to their
complaints:
   "The nobleman that can make my daughter Sarah smile again, for she's 
mourning the loss of her fiance. will never pay taxes again."
   This caused an uproar at the protest meeting. Most of the princes decided 
there was no need now to complain, for each was quite sure he would succeed 
where others might fail. So off they went to get ready to try and make Sarah 
smile. But some of the nobles warned their fellows that, with his words, the 
emperor was not really abolishing any taxes at all. From that day on, a long 
procession of noble knights trooped from all over the empire to the palace to 
try and console the weeping princess.
   The crowds cheered them as they passed, but when they returned with bowed 
heads, the same crowds booed and whistled at their failure. The days went by 
and the list of defeated knights grew longer . . . Indians, Circassians, Arabs
and Turks . . . from all over the provinces came bold young men, bouncing with
confidence and hope. But the minute the princess set eyes on them, she just 
wept and wept. The emperor was delighted, for each failure meant another 
taxpayer. Even the common folk seemed contented to see that the rich too did 
not always get what they wanted. The only unhappy person among them was Sarah,
who went on weeping.
   One day, a Mongol prince seemed to be on the point of winning a smile. He 
thrummed his balalaika for hours, playing first a sad tune, then a more 
cheerful one, till he finished by playing a merry jig. The princess sat for 
ages staring at him eyed and the onlookers thought she was about to smile.
Instead she burst into floods of tears, to everyone's disappointment. A 
Kurdish chief, famed for his humour, who had already kept the court in fits of
laughter, tried to steal a smile from Sarah with his witty remarks. But the 
princess's dark eyes filled with tears. Noblemen came from as far away as 
Persia, but in vain.
   The only person who had not yet appeared was Omar, the chief of the tiniest
farthest away province. A bright, intelligent young man, he had cleverly got 
the better of certain greedy ambitious relatives that tried to take away his 
power when he succeeded his uncle as chief. The emperor's messengers had taken
a long time to reach this remote realm, and though Omar set out at once, on 
hearing the news, he rode for many days on his fine black horse. Then, one 
evening, he reached the palace. When the tired and dusty traveller explained 
to the stable boys why he had come, they laughed in scorn. But they had orders
to obey, so they told him to enter.
   "It's late," they said, "and you won't see the princess till tomorrow."
   The emperor's other daughters, however, were soon told of the new arrival.
"He's the most handsome of them all!" exclaimed one of the servants. So 
Marika, the emperor's youngest and prettiest daughter, with her sisters, 
peeked through a window at the sleeping Omar. Next morning, the emperor 
ordered the newcomer to be led before Sarah. The court crowded round to watch.
Unlike all the other suitors, Omar did nothing at all to amuse the princess. 
He stared at Sarah without saying a word. And she stared back, with an empty 
look on her face. The two young people stared silently at each other. Then 
Omar went back to the emperor and said:
   "Sire! Give me your sceptre and I will solve the problem of Sarah." 
Surprised at such an odd request, the emperor followed Omar into Sarah's room.
The other princesses clustered round, smiling and admiring the handsome young 
man. With a deep bow to Sarah, Omar straightened up and dealt her a blow on 
the head with the sceptre. Screams filled the air the emperor threw up hls
arms in rage and his daughters fled in all directions. The guards drew their 
swords. Then the whole room stopped in amazement. For, out of Sarah's head, 
which had been chopped off by the blow, rolled broken springs and pieces of 
metal. The princess that never smiled was a doll! A perfect dolll And nobody
had ever been aware of it except Omar.
   The only princess that couldn't stop laughing was Marika. The emperor 
glared at her.
   "Be quiet . . ." he ordered. But he too saw the funny side of it. For the 
crafty emperor had been making use of Sarah the doll as a way of guaranteeing 
himself a steady flow of taxes from all his subjects. And now, a man more 
cunning than himself had exposed his trick. The emperor had a sudden thought:
he would rid himself of the cheeky Marika and gain an astute son-in-law able 
to help him hold onto his kingdom.
   "You should be put to death for this insolence," he said, "but I'm going to
spare your life, if you marry my youngest daughter. Of course, you won't need 
to pay taxes!" Smiling at a happy Marika, Omar nodded silently. Down in the 
depths of his mind he was thinking:
   "One day, dear father-in-law, I'll be sitting on your Imperial throne." And
he was, a few years later.
