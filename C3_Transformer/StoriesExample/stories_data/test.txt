                         THE GREEDY DOG

   Once upon a time . . . a dog managed to steal a large steak from a 
butcher's shop, and ran into the woods to eat it in peace. On reaching the 
banks of a stream, he happened to see his face reflected in the water. Never 
for a moment thinking that he was looking at himself in the water, what he
thought he saw was another dog, holding a large steak in its mouth. 
   Being a greedy dog, he jumped into the stream to snatch the other dog's 
meat. Of course, the reflection vanished and he could see no sign of dog or 
steak.
   Only then did he realize that, when he barked to frighten the other, he had
dropped his stolen meat. Unluckily for him, the current was swift and the 
steak had been carried away. And though the dog hunted all over, he couldn't 
find a trace of it. Which meant, that instead of having two steaks. he was 
left with nothing.

..    TITLE:  THE WIND, THE COLD, THE CANDLE
..
  The pickup bucked and skittered sideways.  Dan jammed the shift lever into
second and wrestled the wheel around.  The engine screamed.  Outside, the
blizzard wind shrieked.  The pickup hung poised, its nose up, unwilling to
move.  Diana wanted to tell Dan she loved him with all her heart.  She clamped
her lower lip between her teeth and hung on as the truck tipped forward into
the drift.  A spray of white powder drove up and was snatched away.  The four
wheels caught, one at a time, and the pickup crawled up the side of the
barrow-ditch.

  "Dan?"

  "Just a sec, honey." He sucked in a deep breath and shook himself loose.
"That was a little too close." He got the pickup back on the hardtop and the
going was briefly easy where the wind whipped the snow from the road.

  "Shouldn't we go back and try to help them?  Leaving them like that..."

  "Diana, honey, think a minute, okay?  We have a pickup.  No room for anybody
else.  They are inside a car, out of the wind.	As soon as we get to town, we
can send the sheriff and his snowmobiles and what-not out.  We are helping
them, as best we can." He patted her knee and grinned, "Besides, we gotta get
junior in where it's safe and warm, hummm?"

  "I suppose...  but still..." It wasn't really possible so soon, only the
third month, but she felt extra weight deep in her middle so she said nothing
more.

  The pickup worked its way along, whining and grumbling.  Along with snow, the
wind whipped tumbleweeds and even sagebrush past.  The occasional drifts across
the road became more numerous.	The road surface was hard to tell from the flat
plain around but, because blizzards are common in Wyoming, the Highway
Department had long ago set out stakes topped with reflectors every hundred
yards or so along every official road in the state.  The snow was thick enough
that Dan had to squint and guess to find each one.  Headlights were no help at
all in the murky storm light.

  He could not find the next blizzard stake.  Maybe it had been knocked down.
Perhaps the road turned.  Maybe the snow was just too thick.  His breath came
in short, hard, shallow gasps as he whipped his head from side to side, forcing
his eyes to probe deeper into the storm.  He slowed the truck, hoping to feel
the difference in surface if a wheel left the blacktop.  Off to his left, he
spotted the stake, leaning crazily to one side, its white reflector catching
the feeble sunlight.  He wrenched the wheel around and felt the rear wheels
break loose and spin.  He backed off the gas to give them a chance to grab but
the heavy pickup had too much momentum, he'd swung it too hard; the rear end
eased slowly into the barrow-pit and Dan felt the frame crunch solidly as the
truck high centered; half on the road, half in the ditch.

  A blizzard in Wyoming is a very different thing.  In Minnesota, the trees
modify a blizzard, give it substance.  The snow drifts up everywhere in
fantastic, romantic and capricious ways.  In Wyoming, along the North Platte
River, where the mountains end abruptly and the high, dry, flat plains spread
north and west of Casper for hundreds of miles, nothing catches the
wind-whipped snow.  Or nothing much, anyway.  The bad storms rise quickly, and
are as quickly gone, but they are savage beyond comprehension.

  Dan didn't waste much effort on cursing.  He'd gotten stuck with no help; it
was up to him to correct the mistake, to get help to Diana and the child.  The
truck had a good heater, the cab was warm and the wind could find no way in.

  Like most Westerners, Dan kept blankets and candles in the truck winter and
summer.  In winter he added other gear.  His mittens were surplus U.S.	Air
Force, leather and fur on the hands with nylon canvas sleeving that tied just
below the elbows.  He wore heavy, insulated boots, ski pants and a very good
parka.	To cover his face, though, he had only an old, dusty, blue bandana he
found under the seat.  He would have to walk head down, arms wrapped around his
face much of the way into Casper.

  He figured it at about two miles.

  They had driven aimlessly west of Casper on the back roads, the tire tracks
that scar the Wyoming tundra, exploring land that looks flat and dull and is
full of sudden beauty.	It was Dan's idea, to roam the brown, empty land, to
give him room to think about himself, about the baby to come, and about Diana
but he came to no conclusion that morning.  The sky was hard winter blue with
just a few high cirrus clouds.	Off on the western horizon, thicker, darker
clouds gathered but Dan and Diana were each preoccupied until the storm was
upon them.  By the time they found the highway, they were crawling in the
center of a tiny, grey-white circle.

  As he laced his boots on good and got his mittens, he went over things with
Diana.	"Okay, light a candle right after I get out.  Be surprised how warm
it'll keep you.  Open a window just the tiniest crack to let in a little air.
If it gets too cold, run the engine until the cab warms up, then shut it off."

  He took Diana's face between the palms of his mittens.  There was much he
wanted to say but he did not know how.	He nearly became lost in her green
eyes.  "Diana, I got us into this.  I'll get us out.  You just stick tight.
And don't, for God's sake, leave the truck.  Okay?" She nodded, he kissed her
quickly and, before he could weaken, snapped open the door and leapt into the
blizzard.

  The wind yanked the heavy door from his hand.  The hinges popped and he was
afraid the door had sprung.  But when he got behind it and pushed, the door
closed solidly.  He grinned at Diana through the window.  She was already
shivering in the sudden cold.  She leaned close and mouthed, "I love you,
Danny.	I love you." He blew a kiss to her with a clumsy mitten, turned into
the storm and discovered he had made a huge mistake.

  The wind blasted from what Dan had thought to be the southeast.  Along the
Yellowstone Highway between Casper and Powder River, that could not be.

  The bad storms come from the Gulf of Alaska.	They pile up against the
Cascades, tumble across several mountain ranges until finally they top the
Grand Tetons and the Wind Rivers and come hooting down the wide, dry flats of
central Wyoming.  The bad storms are from the Northwest.  Always have been,
always will be.

  He was ashamed:  He had known they were north of the highway, not south.  But
when he found the highway, he somehow believed that east, and town, was to the
right hand.  So he turned, mistakenly, west.  In that direction, the nearest
building was at least ten miles further on; a small ranch headquarters and a
tiny rodeo arena where he had dogged steers just last summer.  He turned his
back to the wind and trudged back the way he had come.

  He hoped Diana wasn't watching.  He knew she was.  He hoped she would
understand.  He knew she would wonder.	He thought to stop and explain but
couldn't bear to say that he had been wrong.  He hoped she would figure it out
by herself and rest easy.

  They'd managed about a mile on the highway, so instead of a mile closer, he
was a mile further away.  That was two miles more than he had thought when he
jumped from the truck.	Make it four miles, then add another for bad luck and
he was easily a fool for going on.  He ought to turn back, get in the truck and
explain to Diana his idiocy.  They could hold each other and talk and joke the
afternoon and night time away, lighting one candle from the stub of the last,
keeping each other warm under the scratchy wool of the army surplus blankets as
they waited for the daylight and the end of the storm; the inevitable snowplow
followed by a Wyoming Highway Patrol car equipped with food and drink.

  Diana lit the candle just like Dan told her to.  She watched as he turned
first one way, then the other.	He hesitated, walked to the left, hesitated
again and she hoped he would turn around and come back to her but she knew he
wouldn't.  He had decided to go to Casper for help and Dan always did what he
set out to do.	She held the candle in her hand as she watched the back of his
parka until it vanished with startling suddenness in the snow.	She held the
candle in her hand so that its light shined through the window for a long time
after she could see nothing but the snow racing ahead of the wind because
perhaps he could see it and know that she waited in trust for him to return.

  Dan's breath was already freezing in the bandana and he could feel the wind
at his left shoulder cutting through the insulation and tight weave of his
parka.	Except that the wind threatened to lift him bodily from the ground, the
walking was not at all treacherous.  The hard blacktop had, in most places,
only the thinnest of snow cover and it crunched under his boots.  He thanked
God, though he was not a believer, that he did not have to face the wind.

  He saw, with only mild surprise, that it had not been a stalled car, after
all.  It was the gate the Highway Patrol swung across the road to close it.
He'd known something was not right about the drift.  Not right for a car,
anyway, but he'd just whooped off the road, into the ditch and back up on the
other side, determined to keep going.  He had to get to town.  The patrol would
ignore the highway, now.  They couldn't help.  He had to save Diana.  And the
baby.

  Last night, when he got in from work, he was looking forward to a good
weekend of nothing much, maybe some poker Saturday night.  Some football
Sunday.  As usual, he headed straight for the shower.  The locker-room at the
refinery wasn't much for clean-up and welding is grimy work.

  He didn't see that Diana had the dining table set with flowers and candles.
He zipped right past her to the bathroom.  He missed the carefully curled and
swept hair; the sweet, clear scent of her only just registered.  Dirt was an
unpleasant part of work.  Afterwards he itched until he could get showered
good.

  To his credit, he saw her careful preparations as soon as he, towel wrapped
around his waist and sandy hair still dark with water, padded into the kitchen.

  So, he dressed to match the table and she poured the wine and served the
t-bones and the baked potatoes and told him she was pregnant.

  She would never demand that they marry.  He knew that but he could see no
other way.  Under his feet, the road held straight southeast.  The wind
definitely hit him more squarely across the back.  The chill dug into the backs
of his legs and his feet were becoming heavy and numb.	He cracked the ice from
his bandana again.  His breath was heavier and harder to draw through the
fabric.  He held his mittens over his mouth, hoping to thaw the bandana a
little more.  His parka hood, drawn close around his face, blocked much of the
noise but the wind still screamed and rattled past.  He held to the left edge
of the road.

  Somewhere up ahead, the roads to Natrona County International Airport joined
the highway from the north and there he would find help...if anybody was left
in the terminal and shops.  He wrapped his arms around his face and stumbled
on, head down, watching the boot toes flash forward and then recede, first one
then the other in a stuttering rhythm, as the snow whipped between his legs and
the storm pushed him before it.

  It seemed with every step he lost some freedom.  He got a job at the
refinery.  He had to be there five days a week at seven, sharp.  He met Diana;
no longer could he look for the casual girls he had once known.  They moved
into an apartment that neither could afford alone.  He accounted to her for his
time.  She didn't demand that, or even ask, but he had to, anyway.  He wouldn't
feel right, otherwise.

  But he kept the ultimate freedom.  He could, anytime he wanted, grab his
billfold and walk.  Anytime up to last night, he could walk.  And he couldn't
blame her, either.  That was the hard part.  She couldn't use the pill or an
IUD and he couldn't stand creams and condoms.  He knew it could happen.  He
pretended that it wouldn't.  Nearly two well used years passed before it did.

  He gambled and he lost.  Maybe he lost from the start.  Her eyes had hooked
him at a party.  The deep, strong green pulled him across a smoky living room
to meet her in a quiet corner.	He admired the strong lines of her.  She wore
her body proudly.  Her shoulders, perhaps a shade too wide, were straight and
carried the warm weight of her breasts with no apology.  Her waist narrowed
sweetly just above the wide belt of her Levi's.

  But it was her eyes that brought him and kept him.  In the depths he found a
woman, not a girl nor a chick.	She had suffered great hurt once, he knew.  And
she was wary of a new entanglement.  His feet, moving with no help from him,
caught in a drift of snow and he stumbled sideways, nearly falling, wrenching
himself upright only by the narrowest of muscle cracking margins.

  The drift trailed from the big airport sign.	Had he not stumbled, he'd have
gone right past, leaving another mile before the next possible help.  His feet
were no longer a part of him, the skin of his forehead rasped when he touched
it with his mittens and his legs felt both rubbery and wooden simultaneously.
The road ran north a half mile to the terminal with nothing but a few leafless
and spindly trees planted to either side to break the wind.  It cut now from
his left front quarter.  He tucked his chin deeply into his right shoulder,
wrapped his arms over his face, and slogged on.

  Perhaps a baby would complete the perfection of her.	Their life had begun to
seem too large, too loose.  And they sometimes rattled against each other like
the last two hard dried kernels in a feed bucket.  Maybe he was halfway to the
terminal.  It might as well be halfway to the moon.  He was exhausted, his
breath dragged through the bandana in hard gasps.  He couldn't pull it down to
breathe more freely.  The bandana was stuck to his frozen nose and cheeks.
Diana loved kids, that was certain, and the kids at the School for the Deaf
surely loved her.

  He grinned at that.  Just last week, Diana had been all bubbly excitement
over the planning for next month's annual end-of-school tour and picnic.  As
teacher's aide, she would make sure that all the kids were dressed and equipped
right for the ride to the Dave Johnson power plant and the picnic and fishing
in the little park PP&L had built along the North Platte.  She spent two nights
drawing up lists of things the kids should or could bring so the parents
wouldn't be caught by surprise.  Diana liked to be organized and almost always
was.  Dan wondered what she would have organized for this little picnic, if
she'd known about it ahead of time.

  He giggled behind the bandana.  He heard other giggles.  High pitched and
chittering, the giggles became a manic laughter that racketed from one side to
the other of the road to the airport.  He dropped his arms and searched with
squinted eyes into the white blindness for the voices.	He heard the laughter
behind him.  He whirled.  It was still behind.	Again he spun around.  Now, off
to the left, he saw a vague shadow.  He heard more laughter, shrieking and
clacking, a cold and shivering cackle.	He ran after the shadow, his arms
windmilling and his feet thudding through the snow to the hard frozen ground
beneath until he fell, his face buried deep in the whiteness.  It was warm, as
warm as the first warmth he'd ever known and he gathered it to him and opened
himself to the searing heat of the snow on the skin of his face and he felt his
forehead and cheeks blistering and he knew he had to stand up or be consumed in
the flames so he couldn't get Diana back from the wind and the cold.

  He rubbed his mittened hands hard against his face, up and down, and didn't
know that the skin cracked and broke and that the blood froze in the crevices
of his face and along the ridge of the bandana where it froze to his cheeks.
He faced the wind and moved against it, into the hard, pin- sharp grains of
snow driven through his lashes against his eyes.  The wetness from his tear
ducts froze before it was fairly above the skin and began to cover the whites
to either side of his nose and he shambled against the wind, arms at his sides.
He leaned forward and his legs moved to catch him before he fell but they were
slow.  Without the wind pushing him back, he would have fallen before the foot
could be planted, before the boot at the end of the strange stick that hung
from his knees could dig into the snow and hold long enough for the other stick
to swing forward.  The wind held him until he fell.

  He crawled but he didn't know which way.  He couldn't find the wind and the
whiteness was not white any longer but was rough and grey and hard...as hard as
any sidewalk he had ever skinned a knee on and he knew he was on hands and
knees, head down, looking at the wide sidewalk in front of the long curve of
the terminal building.	He had to find the big doors, the doors in the center
of the curve.  The building blocked the wind.  A huge drift built up on the
drive but that was no concern.	The huge drift that built up in the lee of the
pickup with his life and a candle within was his concern.  He crawled again,
blood began to drip from his chin.  His corners of his eyes began to thaw.  The
pain was so bright he had to close them and he crawled into the snow bank.

  He turned back and crawled on until he ran into the red brick terminal wall.
He tried to follow the curve.  Again and again he lost the roughness of it
against his left shoulder and blundered away.  Blindly, he lumbered back to the
wall and scraped against it until again he lost all touch.  And he heard the
laughter again but it didn't scare him this time.  This time, he joined in.  He
laughed at the joke.  It was so funny.

  All these two years, he'd hated a part of himself.  He hated the part that
was hung on Diana.  He hated that part because it wasn't free and easy, like
the rest of him.  The joke was, all that time, he was hating the wrong part.
That part wanted to find a snug house with strong, true walls for his family.
That part wanted to get good furniture...hell, it wanted to make the furniture,
to build it beautiful and lasting...to make his life and his candle as snug and
comfortable and warm as could ever be.	The part he hated all that time was the
part of him that kept him alive right now.  That was the joke.	And so he
laughed.

  He laughed as loudly as he might at the monstrous joke life played on him and
the janitor warm in the terminal heard a noise like a dry coughing above the
wind and he called to the guy who'd stayed at the United counter because there
was no way to drive home, to help drag the frayed and bloody bundle onto the
shiny tile floor.  The United guy took over then, because he'd just helped his
son earn the cold weather survival merit badge.

  And Dan stopped laughing at the joke long enough to tell them where to find
his candle.

  ... the Yin and the Yang, the Good and the Bad, the Light
and the Shadow - for this is the crux of the matter, this
alter-ego of what we call Protoculture, the Entity known as
Neoculture.

     Excerpt from PROTOCULTURE AND THE CHILDREN OF THE SHADOW.

                           CHAPTER 1

  Exactly how did I come to the idea of the `Think-Cap`? Well,
when we first developed the Veritech Fighter, we thought we
could control its movements by manipulation of controls in the
cockpit.  This theory crumbled very quickly as we tested the
first plane: its movements were jerky and it left a lot to be
desired in menoeuverability. What we needed was a device like
the human brain to put the finishing touches on the Veritech's
actions.  From there we developed a helmet containing various
apparatus to record the brain's `thoughts` and transmit them
to the `central nervous system` of the plane.  I believe the
term `Thinking-Cap` was first used by Admiral Hunter, while
still a civilian.  It shortened to `Think-Cap` and the name
stuck amongst the pilots. 
                                         Dr. Lang, Interviews.


  Hausthar C. Reneth gave the novel he was holding but a
nervous glance as he waited in his bunk.  He was a boy of
about 17 years, normal height for his age (6 feet 2 inches),
short reddish hair and a body who although wasn't fat could
have done with a little more exercise.  His eyes gave a lonely
feeling, a feeling most people picked up instantly.  This
peculiarity awarded him very little friends and the fact that
he was shy of nature did nothing to help.
  He turned over and wondered when the P.A. system would call
his name.  Hausthar had been in training at the Robotech
Defence Academy for two years now and was waiting eagerly for
the final exam.  Two years of hard drills and brain wrenching
theory on space and atmosphere flight contour and combat were
culminating in a combat simulation where luck somehow seemed
to enter the game.
  Sitting up on his bed, he had just started reading again
when the P.A. hummed to life. 
  "Cadet Reneth, Hausthar C.  Please report to the briefing
room for final combat simulation 5."  The voice from the
speaker was calculated to send chills along a cadet's spine. 
It did.

  As he walked towards the simulation rooms, Hausthar went
into his meditation routine.  To properly interface with a
Veritech Fighter there had to be no outside thoughts, no
interference within the pattern of thoughts of the pilot.  Any
deviance would slow the Mecha's response and make you a
target. 
  Two steps from the Com-Sim door he heard a metallic voice
sounding from within, garbled beyond recognition.  Hausthar
unstrapped his side-arm from its holster (Pilots are to wear
regulation gear during simulations, Simulation Rule No. 24)
and flattened himself against the wall.  The doors were
automatic so he would have to fiddle with the lock and if he
were silent enough he could have surprise on his side.  In a
flash he faced the door and charged in, the door opening in
front of him - and fell down, his foot caught on a wire
stretched inches from the floor. 
  "You have just been killed Cadet!  One does not charge in
when one is expected you know.  Or didn't you hear your name
being called out over the Academy's P.A.?"  Hausthar looked up
to see a metallic figure looming over him like a vulture
waiting for its prey to die.  He forced his eyes into focus
and recognised the semi-humanoid shape.
  "Victor!  What are <you> doing here?" he exclaimed. 
  "I am to be your Com-Sim examiner my friend.  But let me
tell you; if you do as well in there as you did just now, you
haven't got a chance." 
  Victor was a six feet high android, a marvel of Robotech
engineering, created not two years ago.  He was endowed with
the strange life-like qualities that all
Robotechnology-produced machine seem to achieve.  As far as
Hausthar knew, Victor was a one-of-a-kind unfortunately, for
supplies had been redirected towards the construction of the
SDF-2.  Victor worked for Dr. Lang, the Earth's discoverer of
Robotechnology.  What his functions were, however, Hausthar
could only guess at.
  Ever since they had met, Victor had looked after him, acting
like a brother to him and pulling practical jokes most of the
time.  It had been a rather strange sight to see an android
set up a joke and laugh afterwards.  Exedore, the Zentraedi
scientist, had explained that this came from the fact that
Victor used Protoculture technology.  As to what Protoculture
was supposed to be, no-one seemed to have any idea - or they
weren't telling.  For reasons unknown to Hausthar, only a
handful of people outside Dr. Lang's scientific team knew of
Victor's existence; a secret Hausthar seemed privy to. 
  Victor pointed towards the simulation cockpit.  "If you will
enter the simulator, we will start as soon as possible.  You
will be coming from 3 O'Clock high with regard to the enemy
target at a velocity of Mach 2.  Your deceleration factor will
be at an initial 0.  Objective: infiltration and destruction
of a Zentraedi Battle-Cruiser by any, repeat <ANY>, means
deemed necessary.  You will be piloting a VF-1J with full
ammo-pack.  Battle-pod density will be at maximum.  Three
squadrons are there to assist you.  Understood?"  Hausthar
nodded.  "Good.  Now if you will wait a moment, someone else
is taking the test too." Victor entered the control room and
looked into the adjacent simulation area where another figure
was waiting by its machine.

  Michele Cequor was not impatient by nature but the waiting
was gnawing at her nerves.  She was a tall, slender girl, 16
years of age, with long, rust-coloured hair and light-green
eyes that wouldn't quit sparkling.  Among boys her age she was
considered `dangerous` ever since she put one of their friends
in hospital after he had made a rather open pass at her.
  A series of heavy footsteps behind her made her turn around
and face her examiner.  Victor stepped into the pool of light
surrounding the simulator and greeted her.  Michele replied in
kind as she jumped into the cockpit.  She wasn't surprised to
see Victor, after all he had always been there for her
whenever she needed help.  Especially since her parents had
died.  She shook her head, banishing the thought.
  Michele had already been briefed about the simulation and
Victor was now checking her straps.  She understood the
meticulous care with which he did it.  Series five simulations
were rough on you.  Many a time had she come out of the
cockpit with bruises and she had heard of a couple of broken
arms from last year's graduates.  This was as close to reality
as you could come (almost) without risking your life.
  Victor finished his checks and closed the simulator's
canopy. Swiftly, he made his way back to the control room,
closed the door behind him and sat down in front of two
consoles, the chair straining under his weight.  He flicked a
couple of switches and monitors came to life around him.  He
particularly studied two sets of screens which would give him
an outside observer's eye-view of the simulations and an
interior view of the cockpits.
  The lights dimmed within the confines of the simulator rooms
as he bent over a mike and signalled the start of the tests. 
On his screen he saw the faces of the young pilots relax as
they made contact with their Mecha.  With but a few moment's
hesitation both went into action, unleashing destruction in
their own, private little war.

  Hausthar menoeuvered his Veritech close to the
Battle-Cruiser and searched for an opening while firing at
incoming Battle-Pods.  The enemy's ships looked not so much
like machines as headless, featherless ostriches: oval spheres
from which hung pairs of reversely-hinged mechanical legs.  He
looped to avoid incoming laser fire and released a pair of
heat-seekers at the Pod in front of him.  He was just about to
target another when his plane shook from a direct hit. 
Turning his head to inspect the damage, he saw a sizeable hole
in his left wing.  In space it did not matter but it now ruled
him out from any atmospheric combat that might take place.  He
swore and told himself to be more careful.  Looking forward
again he relaxed, mentally reaching further inward to the core
of his Veritech Mecha.

  It wasn't so much having trouble as not getting a break. 
Ever since the simulation had begun, Michele hadn't had a
chance to search for an entrance into the Zentraedi Cruiser. 
She blasted the few Pods that were on her side of the ship and
switched her plane to Guardian configuration.  Her F-14
look-alike plane shuddered a little as the two engines swung
down to form legs, the exhaust splitting in two, becoming
feet.  The ailerons folded inward and the tail assembly
flipped and came to rest on top of the main body.  From the
back, where they had been positioned between the engines, two
rectangular pods moved to the side, swung forward and hands
slid out from their fronts to form two arms.  The Veritech
hung there for a moment, a majestic hawk with arms, then
detached a high-powered GU-11 gun pod from its right forearm
and readied itself for battle.  Already more Pods were coming
from over the Cruiser to do battle.  The Guardian swung its
GU-11 towards them as Michele mentally reached in and sunk
into the technology that surrounded her.

  Victor was quietly watching the simulations when an alarm
sounded - something was wrong with Hausthar's simulation.  He
was about to request further information when a second buzzer
joined in, this time coming from Michele's console.  What had
been deemed impossible was now happening: the simulations were
being tampered with.  Victor reached for the phone and started
dialling.

  Hausthar was in trouble - for a while now, he'd had a couple
of Pods on his tail and could not shake them off.  He had got
himself to accept the inevitable when a sudden burst of
high-density depleted trans-uranic shells took out both
enemies at once.  He turned around and saw a Veritech in
Guardian mode blasting Pods in every conceivable directions. 
Taking advantage of the fact that the Pods were now more
interested in the Guardian than in him, Hausthar changed his
Mecha into Battloid.  The plane mechamorphed to Guardian and
continued to change; the `legs` moved forward along the
cockpit as the plane split in half just before the wings.  The
two parts folded as the wings swung back, forming chest and
back.  A laser turret previously located under the cockpit
slid from its protective placing and rightened itself on the
`shoulders`, looking like a visored helmet.  The Battloid
grabbed the GU-11 gun pod from its fore-arm and headed for the
Battle-Cruiser.

  Michele had been eliminating Pods right and left, trying to
make her way towards the cruiser, when she encountered a
Veritech in need of assistance; whoever was inside was pursued
by two Pods and had tried to shake them, to no avail.  She
back-flipped her Guardian and sent a burst of high-density
depleted trans-uranic tracers at the pursuers.  The tracers
met their targets, ripping armor off the Pods and reaching
into the vehicles to their power plants.  Both Pods
illuminated the sky with the light of their final doom.  The
now-freed Veritech changed into Battloid and proceeded to
blast a portion of the Battle-Cruiser's armor away.  It waited
outside long enough to look her way, as if making sure she was
all right, then entered the ship.  Michele took this as an
invitation, fired her last pair of heat-seekers at an
approaching Pod and followed the Battloid into the ship.

  Dr.Lang entered the control room running and proceeded to
sit down without asking a question; apparently he had been
briefed on the problem.  His eyes gleamed with excitement. 
Victor was not sure what to make of this.  Dr. Lang was not
known for his emotional outbursts.  In fact, nothing phased or
excited him apart from Robotechnology.  For him to be this
restless it must have been very interesting indeed.
  "I don't <believe> it!  Victor, have you seen this?  They've
broken into each other's simulations!"  Lang's German accent
was strong during moments of stress and this was one of them.
  "I never dreamed this would be the outcome of the project! 
This... <this> is incredible!"  Lang reached for the intercom
and requested for the transcript of the simulations to be
brought up to him as soon as possible.  He leaned back with a
smug look on his face.  For the first time in his existence,
Victor saw Lang smile at something that was not powered by
Protoculture.  They both turned around and faced the monitors
where a battle of rare violence was unfolding.

  Hausthar and the other Veritech (which had changed into
Battloid by now) made their way towards the engines at a
painfully slow pace.  They were stuck outside a cargo bay with
Zentraedi troops shooting at them from inside and Battle-Pods
coming in from the rear.  Hausthar looked towards the bay's
ceiling, changed to Guardian and unleashed a series of
missiles at the power circuits overhead.  A chain of
explosions raked the cargo bay and shook the corridor in which
they stood, forcing the Battloid to hold on to an overhead
pipe.  Hausthar peeked inside the bay and saw no movement.  He
motioned the other Mecha to follow him and crossed the
now-devastated area to the door on the far side.

  Michele watched as the Guardian beside her released a
contingent of missiles at the bay in front of which they had
stopped.  She grabbed an overhead conduit as the floor moved
from underneath her feet and steadied the Battloid.  The
Guardian urged her on and crossed the open expense of the
cargo bay.  Michele followed it, allowing herself a look at
the dead Zentraedi.  The aliens were fifty to sixty feet tall
and humanoid in build.  In fact, if it wasn't for the height,
they could have passed off as her next-door neighbours.  The
Veritech's Battloid mode had actually been created to handle
hand-to-hand fighting with those giants.
  A nearby explosion shook Michele out of her daydream and
brought her back to the 'reality' of the simulation.  The shot
had been fired by a group a Battle-Pods which had caught up
with them while they had been pinned down.  Michele ordered
her Battloid to turn around and fired a shot at the electronic
lock on the door between them and the Pods.  The door hissed
shut, breaking one of the Pods' laser cannon in two. 
Michele's Battloid broke into a run and followed the Guardian
to the nearby engine room.

  Hausthar watched in admiration as the Battloid accompanying
him got rid of a group of following Pods.  <Not bad!> he
thought.  <They're making these simulations more realistic all
the time.  If I didn't know better, I'd swear that Battloid is
controlled by a real pilot.>
  His train of thought stopped short as he found the door to
the drive room.  The door was shut tight so a couple of
bullets made themselves acquainted with its lock.  He left the
Battloid as a guard and went inside to try to overload the
engines.  No sooner had he stepped inside that three Zentraedi
stepped from behind what looked like maintenance material and
showered the area he was occupying with lasers.
  <Maintenance material?  Wait a minute.  Zentraedi don't know
how to maintain or repair any of their equipment.>  He'd have
to talk to somebody about this!  Hausthar dodged his Guardian
to the side and emptied his Gatling gun into the power
coupling of the engines behind the Zentraedi.  The GU-11 made
the awaited buzzsaw sound as its gatling cannons peppered the
coupling until it ran out of ammunition.  The coupling began
to glow with the light of uncontrolled energy.  Hausthar did
not wait to see the result of his shots and retreated out of
the room as explosions began to resound within.

  Michele had somehow sensed that the Guardian wanted her to
remain on guard outside the room.  She heard shots being
exchanged within and suddenly saw the Veritech come through
the door as if its laser-punctured tail rudders were on fire. 
She followed it down the corridor and arrived at a dead end. 
With an unspoken agreement she let loose her remaining tracers
while the Guardian opened fire with its laser turret; the wall
could not take the combined beating and gave way.  The air
rushed out to meet the vacuum of space, sucking out the two
Veritech Mecha at the same time.  Both reverted to Fighter
configuration and kicked in their after-burners to gain speed. 
<To Hell with fuel consumption!> thought Michele.  <I've got
to get out of here!>
  From behind her a bright light emerged as the
Battle-Cruiser's engines finally gave way to the on-rushing
flow of energy and exploded with a flurry of unleashed
Protoculture.

  Hausthar's jet shook as it caught shrapnel in its belly,
warning lights telling him he had lost his left engine and
laser turret.  The Veritech next to his waved its wings at him
in victory and returned to the SDF-1.  Hausthar nudged his
plane into a low-consumption orbit towards the Fortress until
he could be picked up by the rescue operators.

                           CHAPTER 2

  There was not a day during most of the First Robotech War
when I did not hear of a pilot's incredible escape from death
quoted as 'coincidence' or 'shear dumb luck' and that got me
thinking.  So many 'coincidences' were happening that I
finally got around to interviewing Dr. Lang and the Zentraedi
Historian/Adviser Exedore on the subject.  Their answers
talked of a Plan - not, as one might be excused to think, a
military plan, but rather one emanating from the Protoculture. 
It was their belief that the Protoculture was able to shape
events much more easily than it did machines during
mechamorphosys, a term invented by Robotech Research to
describe the process of transformation of a Veritech.  What
are the implications of this Plan and what is it working
towards?  Exedore seems to think even the Robotech Masters,
creators of the Zentraedi race, do not know.  Maybe we shall
find out if we ever meet with the Invids, rumoured to
literally thrive on Protoculture.

  Cadet Reneth went back to the mess hall where he met with
Michael Circle, one of his rare friends.  Greeting him with a
wave of his hand, Hausthar sat down at an empty table, waiting
for Michael to join him.  Michael was a tall, slim young man
with a life-guard's build and a smile that would let you know
everything was going to turn out for the best.  He also was
the Academy's top scorer in the simulator and in social
events.
  Michael sat on the chair opposite Hausthar's and had started
digging into his lunch when the results from the final exam
were posted on the master bulletin board screen.  Michael
glanced down the list to his name and gave a <whoopee> as he
viewed his score.  Hausthar had a look at it.  Rather
impressive; Michael had good reason to be pleased.  He shifted
his gaze downward to his name and froze as he reached it:
there, in blinking letters where his score should have been,
was a message from High Command.  Slowly he read it out. 
<Report to Dr. Lang at once.>  What had happened?  He hadn't
cheated on any of his tests, so why was he summoned by the
sacro-saint of the R.D.F.?
  Michael was still grinning madly when he finally caught the
look on Hausthar's face.  He turned around, saw the notice and
the smile vanished from his own.  No-one, but no-one, was ever
called to Research unless something drastic had happened and
so far those who had gone there had never gone back to the
academy.  Whatever the problem Hausthar had with Research it
was a big one, and Michael intended to make sure his friend
got away clean.

  Hausthar sat in the waiting room, reading a technical
magazine relating the latest advances in Robotechnology,
trying hard not to look nervous - and failing at it.  The
receptionist glanced in his direction over her glasses and
smiled.  Most people had the jitters whenever they were called
to see Dr. Lang; his irisless eyes alone were enough to put
you off.  But Dr. Lang seem to have a knack for making people
feel that Robotechnology was the Ultimate Science, and
theatrics was his best approach at it.  Even so, Lang was
taking longer than usual with the person he was talking to
right now.
  Hausthar was about to ask the receptionist to ring Lang when
the door to his office opened and a young woman with rust-
coloured hair walked out briskly, her face lit up by a joyful
smile.  Lang followed her out of the office and spotted
Hausthar.  "Ah, there you are.  I am sorry about the delay. 
Won't you come in?"  The receptionist goggled at her employer,
hearing him apologising to someone.  The outburst of concern
from Lang did nothing to calm Hausthar's nerves.  He had heard
of Lang's legendary aloofness when it came to people; the fact
that he was now making an effort to be charming was unnerving.
  Lang sat down behind his desk, took a file that was lying on
top of it and began to read out loud: "Cadet Hausthar C.
Reneth.  Date of birth: Unknown, presumed to be around 1995. 
Place of birth: Unknown, from the accent presumed to be North
American Continent.  Found wondering in the Western
Wastelands, amnesiac, in September 2011.  Amnesia was
accredited to shock.  Both parents presumed dead.  Entered the
academy in January 2012.  Almost perfect scores on the
simulators during his stay.  Nature: Shy.  Recommendations:
Cadet Reneth is too non-violent of nature to make a proper
combat pilot.  Suggest position in rear-echelon.  Signed: E.J.
Maetseas, Academy Supervisor."  Lang placed the folder back
down and looked at Hausthar with his totally black eyes.  A
moment of silence passed before Lang talked again.  "I had a
look at your last simulation, Cadet."  Again a pause, making
Hausthar sweat more than he thought humanly possible.  "I have
a proposition to make to you.  How would you..."  At that
moment, shouts of protests emerged from outside the office.  A
cry of surprise echoed through the door, which was suddenly
flung open by a tall, smug looking, brown-haired Cadet. 
<Michael>, thought Hausthar.  What was he up to now?
  "I'll apologise later to your secretary for tying her up,
Doctor."  Michael had a gleam in his eyes, a gleam that
Hausthar had learned not to trust; it generally meant that he
was about to pull a joke on somebody.  Michael stepped forward
and the office started to fill with scores of students until
only the area behind the desk was free of them, the Cadets
maintaining a respectful distance from Lang.
  "We've come to expiate our sin, Doctor.  Whatever it was, we
were all in on it.  Right guys?" he shouted to the mob behind
him.  A deafening chorus of <Yeah>s and <You're on>s erupted
from the group.  Michael grinned that smile of his again.  "So
what's it gonna be, Doc?  You can't very well expel the whole
Academy."  A smug look made its way past the smile on his
face.
  Lang looked at the crowd in his office and smiled inwardly
as he spied the looks of concern on all the present faces. 
"As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted, how
would you like to become a part of Robotech Research?  We are
currently looking for new test pilots."  A wave of silence
swept the crowd as the words sunk in.  All eyes were on a
baffled Hausthar who was still trying to make some sense of
the situation.  After several tense seconds, his brain finally
gave signs of life.
  "I accept."  The shouts and cheers from his fellow students
set off half the earthquake alarms in the building.

  As the last of the Cadets left the office, a side door
opened and Victor joined Dr. Lang in his office.  "It is as
you predicted."  To Victor this did not make sense.  His
forecast had been that only Michael would turn up to defend
his friend.
  "Yes my friend," said Lang "it is surprising.  But no less
than is to be expected when you try to outwit the
Protoculture."
  Victor turned towards the files on the table.  "I see you
have transferred the other to the Skull Squadron.  Is that a
wise move considering the importance you seem to attach to her
well-being?  Surely you must know that the Skull is a
commando-like outfit, picked for all the dangerous missions. 
Do you really want to endanger her so?"
  "Victor, let it suffice to say that it would be going
against the Protoculture to do otherwise.  She requested the
transfer and I gave it to her."  He paused for a while,
sitting amidst his thoughts.  "I have new orders for you
concerning these two.  You will watch over them and report
their every actions to me and me only.  I want to know where
they are at all times.  And most importantly, they must never
meet or get to know of each other!  Is that understood?"
  "The order is understood, but not the motives.  Surely there
can be no harm to the Shaping if two humans meet one another?"
  "Ah yes, the Shaping... Let me show you something about
those two particular humans."  Lang went over to a wall safe
and placed his hand on a touch-sensitive plate.  A light
emerged from the safe's door and scanned Lang's left eye
before a soft voice finally said "Retinal scan positive.  Safe
opened."  A muted click sounded as the safe swung open.  Lang
reached in and removed a thick dossier which he offered to
Victor.
  "Here, read this."
  Victor scanned the first page and let out an electronic
whistle of surprise.  "So that's why you are so interested in
them.  But what about the third?"
  "The third one?"  Lang paused, lost in thoughts.  "He died
right after his 'birth'."  He turned to face the panoramic
windows behind his desk.  The Japanese countryside laid out in
front of him, his irisless eyes wondering towards Fujiyama,
lingering on the dormant volcano.  He still found that memory
too vivid, even after all this time.  "I consider it a
personal failure.  The blame was entirely mine."  His eyes
stayed fixed on the mountain, his thoughts away from
Robotechnology to his moment of failure.  He never heard
Victor leave.

  Michele knocked on the door of the flight commander's office
and cursed under her breath.  She was perspiring heavily and
swearing against the air-conditioning which had been present
on the plane that had brought her here.  Why couldn't they
have turned it off and let her get acclimatised with the
South-American climate?  She waited for an answer to her
knock, then walked into the room.
  The office was not especially large and the lack of windows
did nothing to help; windows were not particularly sought
after near the Zentraedi Control Zone - they had the nasty
habit of attracting Battle-Pods at night.  All along the walls
were aerial photographs and military maps of the area around
the South-American Grand Cannon, a military base that had been
taken over by Zentraedi Malcontents.  On the far end of the
room was a desk and standing around it were two figures.  The
first one, obviously female, had green hair, what Michele
would have called a perfect body, and yet gave out an aura of
command and power.  The second figure was that of a man with
blue hair, a person who would look right paper-pushing behind
a desk.  Michele approached the woman.
  "Corporal Michele Cequor, reporting for duty, Ma'am."  She
gave a brisk salute and waited.  Not being able to see the
woman's rank, she had decided against possible embarrassment
and not guessed it.
  The woman with the green hair turned towards her with a
startled look on her face and answered her salute.  A grin
appeared on her lips.  "Good morning to you, Corporal. 
However, I am not the commanding officer.  The person you want
is Commander Maximillian Sterling."  The woman's shoulder
finally fell into the pool of light generated by the room's
incandescent globe and a Lt. Commander insignia shone hard in
the semi-darkness of the office.
  "Thank you Ma'am.  Could you please direct me to him?"
  The woman's grin expanded to a smile.  "Certainly."  She
gave the man next to her a push with her elbow.  "Max? 
There's someone here to see you."
  The man looked up from the maps and pushed his glasses
further on his nose.  He obviously had not heard a word of the
conversation which had taken place.  "I'm sorry Miriya, what
did you say?"
  "I said someone's here to see you."  She pointed to Michele
who had, by that time, turned completely red.
  Commander Sterling moved around the table and stared at her,
his blue-tinted glasses shining in the darkness.  "What can I
do for you?"  His voice was calm and soothing and his attitude
gave off an air of self-humility.
  Michele was still red with embarrassment.  "Corporal Michele
Cequor, reporting for duty, Sir."  Her blood was beating
furiously in her neck.  She hadn't been here for five minutes
and she'd already committed a blunder.
  "Oh yes, we were warned about your coming.  It seems you
consider yourself quite a good fighter pilot."  Sterling's
smile seemed on the verge of neatly splitting his face in two. 
"A friend of mine taught me that thinking is different from
doing."
  The Lt. Commander's voice came from a seat near the far
corner.  "Max, would you please stop teasing her?"
  Michele's face was once again red, but this time from anger. 
How could he doubt her abilities?  "If you do not believe my
files, maybe a test...?"
  "Yes, why not."  Although Michele would not have thought it
possible, Sterling's smile increased again.

  The base's simulation room was smaller than the one at the
Academy but otherwise looked the same.  Michele strapped
herself in and gave the <Go> signal.  A tech's voice resounded
in her ear.  "We'll run a simple simulation: attack of a
Zentraedi renegade camp.  Intelligence has it that the
renegades are armed with a Heavy-Artillery and a Tactical Pod. 
Good Luck."  Lights dimmed, the simulation began.

  Michele was flying at low altitude over the jungle, her VF-
1A responding swiftly to her controls.  She spotted a column
of smoke coming from below, slowed her fighter and
mechamorphed to Guardian, her Veritech hovering just above the
tree-top.  She zoomed-in her external cameras towards the fire
and spent a few seconds spying on the fire's proprietors.  She
counted two Heavy-Artillery and a Fighter Pod.  Once more
Intelligence had failed to live up to its name.  She kicked in
her external speakers and spoke in a firm voice.
  "<Zentraedi.  This will be your only warning.  Stand clear
of the Pods with your hands up.  Do not attempt to resist
arrest or face the consequences of your actions.>"  Military
Protocol dictated the warning, Zentraedi up-bringing decreed
the response; as usual, the renegades paid no attention to the
threats and jumped for their Pods.  Michele released two heat-
seekers which promptly dispatched one of the Heavy-Artillery
Pods and its pilot.  The rest of the Pods started to
retaliate.  Warnings echoed through the Veritech's cockpit as
shots came up from the jungle, originating from two Female
Power Armors which had laid hidden there.  Too late to do
anything about it, Michele realised she had fallen into a
trap.  The shots impacted on her Guardian, penetrating armor
and frying internal circuitry.  Backups automatically came on-
line, but the damage had already been done; the Veritech
plunged to the Earth, its engines flamed-out.  It hit the
ground with a deafening thud and laid there, unmoving.

  Miriya looked at her husband and saw a frown on his face. 
"Well, she's out cold.  It'll be over in a minute."  She
pointed to the console where Michele could be seen slumped on
her seat, her eyes closed.  A trickle of blood emerged from
under her helmet where she had hit her head on the control
panel.
  Max had already called the paramedics and was about to call
off the simulation when the technician cried out in surprise. 
"I don't believe it!  The Veritech's <reconfiguring!>"
  Maximillian's eyes opened wide.  "What about the girl? 
What's her condition?"
  The tech gave the screen a glance.  "She's still out."
  "Then who is controlling the plane?" enquired Miriya.
  Once again, the tech turned to the console, punched out a
code and made a sound of consternation.  "The computer says
<she> is Ma'am!"

  The Battloid had finished its reconfiguration and now stood
above the trees' canopy.  It dodged the shots fired at it by
the Fighter Pod, rightened itself and grabbed the GU-11
attached to its forearm.  Swiftly taking aim, it pressed the
trigger of the auto-cannon.  The Fighter Pod disappeared in a
bubble of fire.
  The Female Power Armors hung back while the Heavy Artillery
Pod discharged its four missiles.  The Battloid saw it had no
chance of avoiding all of them - counter-measures took out
two, a shot from the gun-pod destroyed a third but the
Veritech had to sacrifice its left arm to protect itself from
the fourth.  The arm disappeared in a cloud of smoke and
debris.
  The wings that formed the Battloid's back swung apart,
revealing sets of missiles; two metal streaks rose from them
on pillars of smoke and annihilated the offending Pod.  Alarms
screamed for attention inside the Battloid as the internal
temperature rose due to a short-circuit in the engines.  A
wail came from the radar as it registered a high-energy
reading from both Power Armors.  The Battloid dropped to the
ground, but too late; one of the beams of energy emitted from
the Power Armors connected with its head, perforating the
armor and severing the servo-motors controlling the head's
laser gun.
  Using its hand to position the laser, the Battloid fired it
at one of the Female Armors.  The laser hit one of the Armor's
missile launchers, melting away the armor and raising the
internal temperature so fast the missiles contained within
exploded, reducing the machine to so much dust.
  The last assailant fired a salvo of missiles and flew away. 
The quickly aimed missiles exploded around the Battloid, but
one made its way to the left torso, ripping the internal
structure apart, causing more alarms to wail in the cockpit. 
The Battloid raised its GU-11 gun-pod and fired at the
receding Zentraedi Mecha.  Armor flew apart from the Power
Armor while the GU-11 started to melt from over-heating.  The
heavy shells finally made their way to the engines of the
Armor and ruptured its primary power source.  The pilot's cry
of rage was cut short by the ensuing explosion.
  The Battloid fell back against a tree, smoke coming out of
the gash in its head, clutching its left side, adopting the
slumped position of its pilot.
  Michele still hadn't moved.

                           CHAPTER 3

  V.C.T.R.; J.N.C.M.; you guys just love to give us weird
initials, don't you?  Have you ever thought what it would be
like to live with initials instead of a name? Hausthar called
me Victor, why don't you call her Janice Em?
                       Remark by android V.C.T.R."Victor"-1 to
                     the Research and Development Cyborg Team.


  The entrance to the building was anything but obvious -
trees, bushes and the architecture did much to hide the front
door.  Hausthar searched for a while, gave up and turned
towards the soldier patrolling the outside.
  "Excuse me.  Is this RDF Research?"
  The sentry looked up and smiled.  "Sure is.  May I help
you?"
  "Er... yes.  Where is the front door?  The path leads up to
nowhere."
  "You're new, aren't you sir?  Well don't worry, everybody
asks me the same question when they first arrive.  You see,
the people in there have a rather strange sense of humour. 
They've hidden the door with an Enhanced Video Emulation so
no-one'll see it.  Just walk straight down the path and into
the wall."  The guard gave him a salute and went back to his
post.
  Hausthar walked to the wall, gave a last pleading look to
the guard, closed his eyes and stepped forward.  He didn't hit
concrete, instead something <wush>ed and a stream of cool air
hit his face.  Opening his eyes, he found himself in the
reception area of an office building.  The door he had just
stepped through once again made its sound as it closed behind
him, still hidden from sight.
  "May I help you?"  The voice was soothing - if he hadn't
been so nervous, Hausthar might have enjoyed it.  He was.  He
didn't.
  "Yes.  I am looking for Dr. Lang.  Where may I find him?  My
name is Reneth."
  The secretary who had been sitting behind the reception desk
got up and walked towards him.  "Ah yes, you must be the new
test pilot.  Nice to meet you Corporal Reneth."
  Hausthar looked at her with a start.  "I'm sorry, there must
be some mistake.  I'm only a Cadet."
  Once again, the secretary beamed her cheerful smile at him. 
"Not since 1600 hours yesterday you aren't.  Dr. Lang pushed
it through.  You must be something special for him to go
through all that trouble."
  "I'm not, I assure you.  I'm just a pilot who nearly didn't
make it on his last simulation."  Hausthar's mind was working
overtime.  Once again Lang had shown human interest in him. 
Hausthar pinched himself hard to make sure he wasn't a
Protoculture-powered android.  His pinch drew blood.  <At
least I'm human.>  He turned his mind back to the problem at
hand.
  "Where might I find Dr. Lang please?"
  The secretary went back to her desk, typed a short sequence
into her computer and waited for the response.  "He is in
Research Lab 19.  If you'll take the elevator to the fifth
basement, it's the third door on the left, fourth corridor to
the right."  Her hand was pointing to an empty wall.  Looking
up again, she noticed the hopelessly-lost gaze on Hausthar's
face and explained.  "The whole reception area is full of
E.V.E.s but if you look carefully, you will notice small white
signs on the floor.  They indicate doors and elevators.  You
want the elevator in the North wall."
  Hausthar thanked her and walked up to the wall, placing his
hand up from where he'd found a mark.  It disappeared into the
wall and the effect of seeing his arm cut off at the wrist was
almost more than he could endure.
  "Why the cocky set-up?" he asked.
  "Well, the R&D staff have a pretty weird sense of humour. 
If you think it's strange, how do you think <I> felt when I
came back after one weekend to find somebody had remodelled
the entire building like this?  Anyway, it doesn't extend into
the Lab area, so once you get into the lift there shouldn't be
any problems."  She picked up a folder from the desk, gave
Hausthar a small wave and vanished through a wall.

  Hausthar drew in a deep breath, walked through the wall into
the elevator, hit the button marked '-5' and fell back against
the rear of the lift.  <This is too much!>  He had expected
strange things to happen, but inside the labs, not in the
reception area!
  The lift slowed to a stop and opened its doors.  Hausthar
sighed with relief as he was confronted with doors.  <At least
there isn't any of these blasted E.V.E.s down at this level.> 
Hausthar wandered down the corridors, looking for the room he
had been directed to.  He came to a halt in front of a door
marked "V.C.T.R. Maintenance Lab".  As he tried the handle,
the door suddenly opened and a startled Hausthar found himself
in front of a tall mound of metal.  It spoke to him.
  "<Haust!>  What are you doing here?"  The voice was very
familiar - it reminded Hausthar of ...
  "Victor?  Is that you?  What happened?"  If what was
standing in front of him was indeed Victor, then someone must
have shoved a grenade in his insides - minus the pin.
  "I'm here for my check-up, as usual.  You didn't think I
repaired myself, did you?  C'mon in, the more the merrier."
  Hausthar entered the room and was treated to a sight he
would never forget.  Victor's  'skin' was lying on a set of
benches at the far end of the room.  All around were batteries
of electronic equipment of various sorts, none of which were
familiar to him.
  "So this is where you come for your lube job?"
  "Yes - apart from the fact that each of my <lube jobs>, as
you put it, costs over thirty thousand credits.  All of
this..." he made a sweeping movement with what Hausthar could
only describe as his right arm "...and all these people are
here just to make sure everything ticks at the right moment. 
All are here to make sure I am in the best of health.  I get
the best mechanics for my joints, the best electronics experts
for my micro-chips... but I still can't figure out why they've
got medics on the team."  His voice lowered so only Hausthar
could hear.  "To tell you the truth, they turn me off before
the medics start on me, so I don't know what they do.  I've
tried asking but I keep hitting a blank wall."  His voice went
back to normal.  "So - what are you doing here?"  He sat back
on a tilt table and settled himself as the technicians went
back to work.
  Hausthar looked for a while before answering.  "I'm looking
for Dr. Lang.  I was told he might be somewhere around here."
  "Well, you got close.  Actually, he's in the next room down
the hall.  Listen, if he's waiting for you, you'd better
hurry."
  Hausthar opened the door to exit, then turned around.  "When
will you be finished?"
  "None of your business, boy.  I'll meet you in your room at
1900 hours - and try to be there, OK?"
  Hausthar gave him a puzzled look.  "How do you know where my
room is?  I've only just arrived."
  "Simple, organic brain!  I reserved it for you.  Nice room
in the west wing, overlooking the cliffs and the sea.  Had
your things transferred there from the Academy already. 
You'll love it.  Now run along.  Mustn't keep the Doctor
waiting."
  Victor ushered Hausthar out and closed the door behind him. 
Hausthar turned down the corridor and made his way to the next
door.  Opening it, he arrived just in time to hear Lang
talking to a small boy.

  The boy must have been five to eight years of age, with
blueish hair, and was wearing a body-suit with RDF insignias
pinned to it.  Lang was crouched next to him, holding one of
those electronic kits which seem to fascinate kids that age.
  "I've told you already, Scott.  If it doesn't want to work
the way you want it to, bashing away at it won't help."  Lang
was examining the breadboard on which the circuit had been
built, prodding several micro-chips which looked the worst for
wear.  "You can't force experiments or people to conform to
your world view!" continued Lang.  "The Universe just doesn't
work that way!  Do you understand?"  The small boy nodded and
kept on staring Lang in the eyes, apparently determined to
take all the Doctor could dish out in the way of lectures. 
"Good.  Now let's see what went wrong."
  Hausthar thought this a good time to make his entrance.  He
cleared his throat and stood at attention.  "Cadet... er,
Corporal Reneth reporting, Sir!"
  Lang looked up in surprise.  He obviously hadn't heard
Hausthar come in.  "Ah, Corporal.  Welcome!  Come in, come in. 
I'd like you to meet my godson, Scott Bernard.  Scott, this is
Corporal Hausthar Reneth.  He'll be working with us from now
on."
  Scott looked up and returned Hausthar's salute.  He was the
only one who even bothered.  Lang nearly smiled at this.  "I
think I should warn you that protocol is not what it should be
around here.  You must understand that we can't just drop
everything and return a salute every time someone walks in. 
We're pretty informal on that subject."
  "I'll try to remember Sir."
  Just then, Lang noticed the still-present Scott, holding his
circuit board in his hand.  He gestured to one of the female
staff.  "Susan, could you please take care of Scott while I
look after Corporal Reneth?"
  The tall, slender tech made her way towards the group, long
amber hair trailing in her wake.  Lang made the presentations. 
"Hausthar Reneth, I'd like you to meet Susan Bernard - my
niece and Scott's mother."
  Hausthar started to salute, but remembered Lang's
instructions and offered his hand instead.  Susan shook it
warmly.  "Glad to have you on the team." she said sincerely. 
She bent towards Scott, took his hand in hers, and led him
away to a bench on the other side of the room.
  "Scott shows great potential as a pilot, but I'm afraid he
just doesn't have the patience to be a scientist." mused Lang. 
Turning towards Hausthar, he beamed a smile.  "Well, any
questions?"
  "Well.." started Hausthar.  "Now that you mention it... What
am I to do here?"
  Lang gave him a startled look.  "You mean they haven't told
you?  Hah, bureaucratic baboons."  He took Hausthar by the
shoulder and led him along the lab.  "You are here to start
tests on new series of Veritechs and Ground Support Mecha."
  "And why have I been promoted?  Not that I mind..."
  "That is easy to explain.  It is an idea of Gloval's,
actually.  To reward volunteers for their services."
  Hausthar had stopped listening after the second sentence. 
"Gloval?  As in 'Admiral Henry J. Gloval'?"
  "One and the same.  You see, Henry... I mean Admiral Gloval,
thought that our present weapons might pale in front of the
Robotech Master's arsenal if it ever came doing to fighting. 
So we have been commissioned to furnish new series of
Destroids and Veritechs.  Let me show you."
  Lang leaned towards a vid-screen and turned it on.  He
punched a sequence of buttons while explaining.  "The last
Zentraedi attack taught us that our Destroids aren't up to
shape, especially the M.A.C. IIs - we lost another one three
days ago.  They're just too easy a target at short range. 
Ah!"  The vid-screen finally came to life, showing a picture
vaguely resembling a M.A.C. II.  The picture rapidly changed
and a whole stream of Mecha were displayed whilst Lang
continued to talk.
  "You see, although we may have the advantage of surprise, it
is a very thin one.  So we have reconfigured the Destroids to
give them better defences in close-quarter combat.  We have
also designed a new series of Veritechs.  Here's the Logan,
the A.J.A.C., and a new ground-based Veritech, the Hover
Tank - none of which have been tested yet.  That's your job
and that of the other pilots.  It's up to you people to test
all these new Mecha and find their faults - and chances are
there will be a lot of them."
  Hausthar was still staring at the screen where pictures of
high-tech helicopters turning into Battloids were quickly
replacing those of a plane barely taller than a man changing
to Guardian.  This was followed by a Hovercraft Tank changing
to a two-legged gun turret and finally into a Battloid.  The
shape of that last Battloid gave Hausthar the eery impression
that it was wearing tails.
  "When do I start?" he enquired.
  "First you'll have to settle in," answered Lang "then learn
the theory behind these new Mecha and have a couple of
sessions in the simulator so you know what they are supposed
to be like.  You'll then try it on actual machines and tell us
where and when they differ from the simulations.  You'll first
try out Research new pet Veritech -  it's a replacement for
the VF-series Veritech... faster and more compact."  He
suddenly seemed to remember something.  "Have you got a room
yet?"
  "Yes, Victor booked on for me.  Even transferred my things
to it already."
  A dark cloud briefly crossed Lang's face.  He quickly
dismissed it with a smile.  "Good, you'll settle in fast then. 
The secretary will give you directions to your room.  Please
come by my office tomorrow at 0900 hours.  We'll finalise your
transfer then."
  Lang turned around without further goodbyes and started
arguing with a technician as Hausthar left.  The argument
echoed through the hall as he headed for the lift, Lang's
voice filling his mind.
  "...And I'm telling you we <don't> need a personality system
check.  Why put more hardware into it than is necessary? 
There is no way J.N.C.M. will develop a relationship with her
other than the one we'll program it with!..."

  As he turned the corner, Hausthar realised he was lost. 
Where he thought the lift should have been was a long
corridor, with doors sprinkled in its walls.  He heaved a
sigh, looked skyward in desperation and approached the first
door.  His recent experiences had made him wary though, so he
first looked in to check if he was not about to interrupt an
experiment.
  The room was large and dimly lit.  The only source of light
was a spot shining from the ceiling onto a table in the centre
of the room.  Upon that table was a small girl, still a baby,
her greenish-blond hair dispersed around her face.  Her head
was covered with electrodes connected to an apparatus Hausthar
recognised immediately - it was the power source from a
Veritech.  What was she doing wired to a Protoculture
Generator?  As he was about to step into the room, a voice
resonated through the darkness, human but with a metallic
twang to it.
  <Well Cochran?  Any reactions?>
  "No Dr. Zand.  We haven't been able to get even a squeak out
of the Sterling girl.  And we've been pumping her full of
Protoculture all day."
  The voice that was Zand gave a thoughtful sound before
answering.  <Increase the level by a factor of two.>
  Cochran stepped into the light.  "But sir, this could kill
her!"  He immediately regretted his outburst.  Hausthar saw
his eyes go wide, his breathing becoming irregular, his hands
clawing at his throat as if someone, something, was choking
him.  The voice came from the darkness again.
  <I said increase the level by a factor of two.  Do you have
something against that?>
  Cochran shook his head negatively in panic, his face
starting to turn blue.  His knees had buckled but he had not
fallen.
  <Good.> said the voice.  <Just remember that.>
  Cochran collapsed to the floor, his breathing coming back as
a painful hiss.  After several seconds he got up, wandered to
the generator and turned a control.  The hum from the
generator increased and a moan rose from the table.
  Nobody noticed Hausthar as he closed the door and went in
search of a bathroom in which he could be sick in peace.

  The first thing she was aware of as she came to was pain -
pain in her head, pain in her ribs, pain every time she drew a
breath.  Her mind started to register other things beside the
pain... a regular beeping sound coming from her left, a slight
cool breeze and warmth on the right side of her face.  She
opened her eyes and closed them just as fast - waves of pain
crashed around in her skull.  She waited until they had
receded and tried again, this time slower.  Her eyes slowly
focused on a blank area in front of them.  <Wall>, she
thought.  She slowly turned her head towards the warmth and
noticed a window through which sunshine was streaming.
  Her mind swung into action as she tried to correlate the
different sights and sound around her.  Awareness finally came
to the top.  She was lying in a hospital room.  Assuming she
hadn't been moved, she was still in a RDF base somewhere in
South America.  She had been sent here to join part of the
Skull Squadron that had temporarily been placed under the
command of Max Sterling.  Her name was... Her name was... Her
eyes opened wide in alarm as she realised she couldn't
remember.  Her name was flitting in and out of her awareness,
taunting her with its information, but never giving it up. 
She laid back once again with a sigh of despair.
  The door opened and a nurse walked in, checked the
instrument panel next to her bed and beamed one of those
smiles that only nurses had been trained to give.
  "Good morning Corporal Cequor.  Nice to have you back
amongst the living."  She proceeded to tidy-up the bed.
  Her name!  And with the name came a flood of memories. 
Michele Cequor, Corporal fresh out of the Academy, had
challenged perhaps the greatest ace the RDF had ever known and
had wound up in hospital!  The problem was, she couldn't
remember how.  Fleeting images of Female Armors and explosions
wavered in her mind.
  "How did I get here?" she asked nervously.
  The nurse finished her chores and looked at her before
answering.  "I really don't know what happened to you.  They
brought you back from the simulation room with a couple of
broken ribs and a concussion.  It was touch and go there for a
while but you looked like you wanted to pull through - and you
did!"  She started for the door.  "You'll be released in a
couple of days so enjoy the holiday.  From what I hear, the
Skulls are being moved back to Macross in a week.  See you
later."  She closed the door behind here.
  Michele looked at the ceiling and tried to get her memories
and feelings straight.  The squadron was being recalled.  That
meant she would be under the orders of this hard-head she had
heard about - what was his name again?  Hunter, Richard
Hunter.  He kept on having this on-again off-again
relationship with both the singing star Lynn Minmei and his
superior officer, Lisa Hayes.  <What a jackass!>
  She laid back and waited to be discharged.  This was going
to be a long week!

                           CHAPTER 4

  People have come to regard Protoculture as just another fuel
to burn, just another weapon to use.  What they do not seem to
understand is that Protoculture radiates, sends out shock-
waves with its every use.  The warriors using it do not seem
to realise that every time they fire a shot, someone out there
has his or her life thrown out of balance.
  And I don't mean the person who gets his head blown off by
the shot!
                  Jan Morris: Solar Seeds, Galactic Guardians.


  Michele was walking away from the hospital, trying very hard
not to break into a run.  She hated the place.  It kept on
reminding her of the price of failure in war.  She made her
way over to the squadron's headquarter, knocked on the door,
waited for an answer and walked in.
  "Corporal Michele Cequor, reporting for duty, sir!"  Hadn't
she said the same thing just a week ago?  Wasn't this the
start of a conversation that had led her to a hospital bed?
  Her thoughts were cut short by the almost too cheerful voice
of the squadron's present commander.  "Hello again, Corporal. 
And how are we feeling today?"  His voice was too syrupy for
her taste.
  "Not too well, sir.  I still don't know how I went with the
simulation.  Nobody seems to want to tell me."
  Sterling's smile left his face.  "Well, let's just say you
showed me I was wrong.  It was a rather, ah... interesting
experience to watch you at work.  Are you packed?"
  The question took her by surprise.  "Er... Yes sir! 
Actually it's more like I haven't yet unpacked.  I spent all
of my time in the hospital."
  "It doesn't matter.  We've been recalled to join up with the
rest of the Skulls in New Macross.  I'm sorry but nobody here
seems to need a wingman, so you'll just have to do by yourself
for a while.  However, a friend of mine in Macross needs a new
partner.  His last one tuned out during a recent attack by the
Zentraedi.  Are you interested?"
  "Yes sir!  What's his name, if I may be so bold as to ask?"
  Sterling's smile made a reappearance on his face.  "you
may - Richard Hunter.  Have you heard of him?"
  <Oh no!  Not him!  Not the jackass!>  She gulped as she
tried to keep her feelings hidden from Sterling.  "Yes sir, I
have.  Quite a bit."
  "He's a good friend and a good pilot.  A bit mixed up
sometimes, maybe, but the best there is!  Besides me that is." 
His smile grew and grew until Michele could no longer stand
it.
  "We're leaving in half an hour Corporal, so have your
equipment stashed on board the transport plane and get your
Veritech ready.  We won't be waiting for anybody."  He gave
her a salute, waited for her to return it, and walked out the
door, leaving a very confused pilot behind him.

  Simulations he'd seen, but never anything like the last set! 
If these new Veritechs were anything like what he'd just
experienced, the Robotech Masters would very likely find
themselves overmatched.
  Hausthar was back in his room, sitting in a chair on his
balcony, feet up on the railing.  He watched the sun as it
drifted slowly towards the sea, its orange mingling with the
dark purple of the water, sending ripples of light which
danced and rolled with the smooth waves of the bay.  Off into
the distance some pleasure boats were making their way back to
harbour before the night.  Behind the dark sunglasses, his
eyes shifted upwards to the sun, squinting as they reached it.
  Hausthar gave a short sound of surprise - he was vaguely
seeing three shadows, maybe twenty feet tall each, covered in
flowing robes whose soft, high collars resembled the petals of
a flower.  The shadows drifted and shimmered, increasing their
wraith-like appearance.  Hausthar closed his eyes, rubbed them
and looked again.
  The shadows had gone.
  <That's it>, he thought.  <You're losing it.  First shadows,
then voices, and then off to the loony-farm.>  He decided he
needed a shower - a long, cold shower.
  As he got up, something slipped from his top pocket and fell
to the  ground.  A letter.  Hausthar picked it up and looked
at it.  The letter was correctly addressed to his room.  He
turned the letter around in hope of seeing who sent it.  No
such luck - the letter didn't even have a return address.  The
funny thing was, Hausthar didn't remember receiving it, much
less placing it in his pocket.  He went inside, grabbed the
letter opener, and opened his mysterious correspondence.  The
message inside was simple and to the point:

                       Meet me at the
                     Black Pegasus Club
                          at 1900.
                     Please come alone.
                                   Ricky.

  At least he now knew the name of the writer.  But who was
this Ricky?  "Well, whoever you are, you've got yourself a
date." he thought out loud.  "But it's going to be on my
terms."
  He folded the letter again and went to change.

  The Black Pegasus Club was a high-class bar/cafe where most
of the Veritech pilots went after a hard day's flying.  Today,
as usual, it was filled with pilots drinking their cares away,
hoping to drown their sorrows in the bottle... and as usual,
failing miserably.  The room was dimly lit but was free of
that perverse low-hanging cloud of smoke normally pictured
with such establishments.  This absence of smoke came from the
fact that very few Veritech pilots smoked, and those that did
never survived long - smoking slowed your reflexes and
mellowed your thought-processes, and in a Veritech this
combination spelled disaster.
  A small band was playing a slow tune in the corner.  It was
composed of all sort of musicians; the Dark Pegasus Band was
renown as an open band.  Anybody could join in at any time -
as long as they played reasonably well.
  Hausthar had chosen a seat in an alcove on the side opposite
the entrance.  A series of Petite Cola bottles were stacked on
his table in the shape of a pyramid, a testimonial to how long
he had been sitting there.  He had just finished placing his
most recent bottle at the apex when a voice broke through the
low murmur of the crowd.
  "<Hi>!  Sorry I'm late.  Been waiting long?"  A shadow
slipped itself onto the seat facing him and placed something
small on the table.  "You wouldn't believe the trouble I had
getting into this joint.  The security here is worse than at
RDF headquarters!"
  Hausthar forced his sleep-weary eyes to focus on the shadow
in front of him and tried to make some sense of what they were
telling him.  The first thing that struck him was the face -
<God she's cute> was a thought that came to mind instantly and
<How the hell did she get in a place like this> was another
that immediately followed.
  The face reflected youth and was not unpleasant to look at. 
A small knob of a nose was set in contrast by two deep-blue
eyes and by the not-quite-shoulder-length crop of pale-pink
hair that was tied back from her eyes by a red piece of
material.  She was wearing a legless, heavy-tissue leotard
with a short-sleeved jacket that only came half-way down to
her waist.  The leotard was light green in colour and the
jacket was light brown, offset with a large patch sewn just
above the left breast.  Hausthar squinted to make out the
embroidery: three pink tri-petal flowers on the same stem
against a background of stars.  He followed the arms down to
the item on the table: slender wrists, complete with light-
green sweatbands, were connected to hands holding a small
purse.  The look was one of girlish seduction and how she had
managed to walk in without eliciting any cat-calls or whistles
was beyond him.
  He hadn't realised how long he'd been staring until she
shook her hand in front of his eyes.
  "Hello?  Earth to Hausthar... Come in... Anybody home?"  Her
face was giving a sincere youthful smile that Hausthar found
irresistible.
  "Um... er... Sorry.  May I assume that you are the one who
sent me the note?"
  "You may - and you would be correct in your assumption. 
Anything else?"
  "Yes.  How did you know where I was stationed?  No civilian
is supposed to know about transfers to and from Research."
  "Well now, if I told you everything there wouldn't be any
little secrets in our relationship, now would there?"
  <Relationship?>  What was she talking about?  "Hum...
Yeah... Well, who are you?"
  "Oh, did I forget to sign the note?  My name is Ricky."
  "Nice to meet you."  Hausthar was feeling a trickle of cold
sweat making its way down his back.  <This is crazy>, he
thought.  <Either she is nuts or I am.>  "Would you like
something to drink?" he proposed nonetheless.
  "Yes, thanks.  How about a Cola?  And loosen up for God's
sake.  I'm not going to eat you."
  "I'm sorry, but I find it very difficult to relax in company
of a person I have never before seen in my life but who seems
to know everything there is to about me."
  "Jeezus.  You're a hard case, you know that?  But if it's me
that's bothering you, I'll put you at ease."  She stood up and
wandered over towards the band.  Hausthar could faintly hear
her ask whether they knew how to play 'In My Heart'.  The lead
musician nodded his head and turned around to talk to his
players.  Ricky walked down the small stage towards a
microphone, flipped the echo switch on and gave a small nod to
the band.  By this time, the room had turned quiet, waiting to
see what would follow.
  The band opened with electric guitars, a piano and a
backbeat on the drums, setting the rhythm for the rest of the
instruments.  The opening was short but alive with feeling and
the audience was already captured in its spirit when Ricky's
voice drifted through the music.

     In my mind,
     I had to try to make it on my own...
     Sometimes it's hard to be alone.
     In my mind,
     My loneliness would never seem to end...
     Something is happening
     I don't understand...

  A trumpet took a soft solo, a languid sound amidst the heavy
backbeat of the drums and the sharp sound of the piano and
guitars, while Ricky danced on the stage.  She twisted  and
turned, doing a half ballet, half disco routine and smiling at
Hausthar all the while.  Slowly, she made her way back to the
mike as the band picked up.

     In my heart,
     I feel the heat
     Of something burning deep inside of me;
     I'll be the one that I could never be,
     Now that I found you!
     In my heart,
     I realise -
     'You ever loved me opened up my eyes.
     You are the answer and the reason why.
     ... 'Living my love for you
     In my heart!                     Music & lyrics (c)
appropriate people

  The band continued with the music as Ricky sustained her
last note, gave a bow to a pleased audience and made her way
back to the table.  Hausthar could not help but smile and join
with the crowd in applauding her performance.
  Ricky sat down, panting slightly from exhaustion.  "Well,
what do you think?  Still uptight?"
  Hausthar smiled.  "I've got to admit you've loosened me up. 
Now, how about that Cola?"
  "I thought you'd never ask."  Hausthar once again noticed
how her smile was enhanced by her dimples.

  <If anything in this world is ever true>, thought Michele,
<it's that night missions are the worst!>  Her Veritech was
making headway towards the Arkansas Protectorate, an area of
North America where the inhabitants had accepted the Zentraedi
as local government.  Through the misty clouds that were
hanging outside her plane she could barely see the rest of the
squadron, and wondered whether or not they were really there
or just part of a delusion.
  The group had just made landsight when the reality of the
world was brought back to her attention.  "This is Skull Two
to all Veritechs.  We've just received news of an attack on a
nearby town and have been ordered to help."  Maximillian
Sterling was on the verge of yawning with boredom as he
informed his crew of their assignment.  The Fighter jockeys
had a strict rule about life: Dying is sometimes unavoidable,
but loosing your cool is inexcusable.
  A voice replied over the Tac-Net.  "Aw Jeez!  Zentraedi
<again>?  Don't these guys ever learn?"
  "Apparently not.  So let's go find them and make them pay
for good ol' France."  Maximillian never had forgiven Dolza's
armada for the destruction of his homeland and had centered
his vengeance on the Malcontents.
  "Roger sir..."  The voice held off for a few seconds as the
planes closed in on the town.  "Got 'em!  Radar contact
established, multiple paints.  Radar signatures indicate two
Light Artillery Pods, one Heavy Artillery Pod, five Battle
Pods and a Cyclop Recon Scout.  Computer also says we've been
scanned - they know we're here sir!"
  "Thank you Corporal.  Alright, listen up.  Normal battle
plan."  A few of the pilot sniggered at this - Normal Battle
Plan generally meant a free-for-all.  "Hit whatever you can
but stay with your wingman!"  Sterling's blue Veritech banked
hard, soon followed by the red of his wingmate and soulmate,
Miriya Sterling.  The squadron split into groups of two,
leaving Michele on her own.
  The pods had known they were coming and proved it by laying
down a barrage of firepower that took out three Veritechs
before anybody had time to react.  The computers of the
surviving Veritechs immediately took note of the location of
the downed planes for later retrieval of the wreckages. 
Michele chose one of the surviving Veritechs and took the
place of its missing partner.  "You've just changed wingman,
flyboy."
  A voice drifted on the Net.  "I noticed my old one dropped
out on me.  My name's Michael.  What's yours?"  Two Stilettos
left the underside of his wings and connected with a Battlepod
intent on the destruction of Skull Two.  The Pod's armor
expanded, cracked, then finally gave way, like an overblown
balloon.
  "Mine's Michele.  Bandit at Six O'Clock - bank right."  She
changed to Guardian mode, thrusters folding forwards, and gave
the engines all the power she could muster from the plane. 
The Fighter shook as the engines decelerated the Mecha at a
rate well above the recommended limits.  A Light Artillery Pod
surged past her and centered itself on her HUD.  Michele
fingered the firing studd and felt rather than heard the
buzzsaw sound from the undercarriage GU-11.  The pod tried to
imitate swiss cheese as the rounds impacted with it, but soon
gave up as its generator exploded, showering debris amongst
the countryside.
  "Skull Two to Skulls Five and Thirteen.  The Cyclop's making
like a banana.  Stop it from splitting any further."
  Michael acknowledged and both he and Michele turned their
planes around and went after the Recon Scout.
  "Yo, Michael.  I never went up against a Cyclop before. 
What are they like?" said Michele jokingly.
  "Think of a saucer with two compass attached to it on either
side.  Also it's green and deadly."
  "In that case I've got a visual on it.  11 O'Clock high,
trying to hide in the clouds."
  "Well, here we go with the usual.  <Zentraedi Pilot.  This
is the first and only warning you will receive.  Land your
craft and come out quietly or face the consequences.> 
Michele, have you ever wondered which lame-brained idiot wants
us to say this every time?  They never comply anyway."
  "True enough Skull Five.  Radar shows incoming missiles. 
Lots of 'em.  Activating ECM.  How about a little covering
fire?"
  "You've got it Skull Thirteen... Watch out, we've got a
survivor... Never mind, it just blew up of its own accord."
  "How's a little pincer manoeuver sound to you?  You take the
right, I'll take the left."
  "Affirmative... Hold on a second, I've got a high-energy
reading coming from this baby."
  "Same here."
  "More missiles?"
  "Radar paint says one medium range heavy warhead, but the
energy paint is totally wrong for it."
  "Try to get a visual on it."
  "<Skull Five, bank right!  Bank right!>  It's coming right
at you!"
  "Got it Skull Thirteen... My God!  I just got a visual on
it.  Those bastards have attached a Reflex Generator to it. 
Avoid contact at all cost.  This thing can blow you to kingdom
come without even meaning to."
  "Negative Skull Five, I can't shake it.  Countermeasures are
not affective.  Computer estimates thirty seconds to impact."
  "I can't get to firing position in that time!"
  "Don't I know it!  I'll try to lure it away from inhabited
areas.  At least neither of us'll do any damage when we go
up."
  "Skull Thirteen, eject!  Dammit Michele, get the Hell out of
your plane!"
  "No can do, Michael.  I'm sticking this one out.  All I need
is just a few seconds more... Come on...  Skull Five, I've
cleared the city.  I'm going to ej..."
  "Michele?  Dammit Michele, answer!... <MICHELE!!>"

                           CHAPTER 5

  We had an inkling of what would happen.  I mean, all of us
had a different idea as to actually what, but we all agreed on
the fact it would be stupendous!  After all, you can't subject
a humanoid body to such an amount of 'Culture without some
side effects.
  Why weren't we sure?  'Cause it is rather hard to find
volunteers who'll agree to have a Protoculture generator
placed beside them and detonated at point-blank range.
                       Remarks attributed to a R&D technician.

  Because you don't just pilot a Robotech ship, Rick; you live
it!
                          Roy Fokker, Skull Leader - deceased.


  "Stop shouting!  I can't hear myself groan!"
  "Michele?  Is that you?"
  "Of course it's me, you idiot!  Do you know of anyone else
who'd use this frequency?"  The voice coming from the tactical
net was tired and drawn-out, with little stops and starts
between words as if the person on the other side was stifling
moans of pain.
  "What's your status?"
  "Don't know yet.  I'm running an analysis program at the
moment."
  Michael thanked the stars for giving him back this
particular wingman, grouchy though she may be.  "What
happened?  I lost contact with you for a good thirty seconds."
  "I have absolutely no idea.  Last thing I remember is the
missile closing in on my tail, a big white explosion, and me
panicking... Hold on, the analysis program has finished."
  "How bad is it?"
  "<Bad>.  Both engines are dying on me, my left wing is
hanging on God knows how, visual communication is non-
functional, weapons systems are down, ditto for the radar and
visual systems.  In other words, I'm a flying wreck.  And if
you thought the hardware wasn't bad enough, I'm leaking
fluids."
  "You mean you're bleeding?"
  The voice that answered back was full of sarcasm.  "Oh what
a novel way to say it.  <Of course I'm bleeding!>  How would
you feel if you'd just had a missile blow up your tail-pipes?"
  "Ok, OK... You don't have to shout.  Can you make it to New
Macross?"
  "I'm blinder than a bat at the moment.  Somebody'll have to
guide me in."
  A smile crept on Michael's face.  "No problem, I know just
the person."  He switched to Skull Two's frequency and raised
Commander Sterling.  "Excuse me sir, but we have a situation
on our hands over here.  We request permission to leave the
mopping up to the rest of the group and a priority approach to
New Macross airfield."
  Sterling's face flickered into being on the left commo
screen.  "How bad is it Michael?"
  "Skull Thirteen is barely able to fly sir.  Most of her
electronics is down and the rest is ready to give."
  "Permission granted Skull Five.  Just you make sure she gets
back down in one piece or I'll nail your hide to my
thrusters."
  Michael saw the smile on Sterling's face and responded in
kind.  "Threat received and understood sir!  See you back in
New Macross."  He switched frequencies again and raise
Michele.  "Yo, Skull Thirteen, we've been ordered back to New
Macross ASAP.  Bank fifteen degrees port, follow my manoeuvers
and let's head home."
  "Roger Skull Five.  Beginning manoeuver... now!"
  Both Veritechs banked, one with the grace of a ballerina,
the other like a hippopotamus doing the two-step.  After-
burners flared into the night as both planes disappeared
beyond the horizon.

  Hausthar's consciousness was struggling to get a grip on
reality.  Blackness surrounded him, closing in on him from all
sides.  He opened his eyes and quickly glanced around.  His
head fell back just as quickly as he moaned in pain. 
Headaches he'd had, but nothing on this scale.  He opened his
eyes again and slowly made his way to a sitting position.
  He was back in his room, that much was obvious.  He wasn't
drunk, this was also obvious.  So why did he have a headache
which would make aspirin manufacturers fight over his account? 
And why couldn't he remember how he'd made it back to the
base?  He got up, fought down a wave of nausea which surged up
and shuffled his way into the bathroom.  Opening the cabinet,
he struggled with a pack of aspirins and swallowed a couple.

  He sat down on the side of the bath and waited for them to
take effect.
  <What happened last night?>  Surely you couldn't get such a
headache from drinking Petite Cola, even if you <did> drink
over forty bottles.  His thoughts went round and round inside
his head as the worst of the headache subsided.  <Breakfast! 
That's what I need!  A good, solid breakfast to get back into
shape, even if it is...> His eyes labored to focus on his
watch... <four O'Clock in the morning!?>  He walked out of the
bathroom, turning off the light as he did so.
  Once he finally got to the kitchenette he started to cook a
couple of eggs and slices of bread, left them to boil and
toast respectively and stomped back into the living-room.  He
spied the sofa, still half-hidden in the darkness, and made
his way towards it, with the resolute intention of falling on
top of it and forgetting all about the world.  This resolution
quickly crumbled as he noticed a dark shape lying on the sofa
and several items of clothing in a pile next to it.
  As he got closer, the dark shape became a blanket with a
head protruding at one end.  Hausthar recognised the face.  He
sat very gently next to her and looked deeply at the face
which was presenting itself.  <Even in her sleep she has a
smile on her lips>, he thought.  He brushed back a strand of
hair that was slowly making its way to her lips and turned his
attention to the pile of clothing next to the sofa.  Shoes,
socks, headband and sweatbands were lying on one side of the
pile.  On the other side was the jacket he had seen her with,
and in the middle was... <her leotard?!>  Hausthar jumped up. 
<My God, what is she wearing under that blanket?>  He made his
way back to the bathroom, turned on the light, and for the
first time noticed that he himself had been walking around in
his underwear.  <Oh this is great>, he thought.  <What else
can go wrong today?>  As if to answer his question, a strand
of black smoke and a pernicious odour twisted their way around
the door into the room.  <Damn, my toasts!>  He scrambled out
through the doorway.

  New Macross Airport was the only airport for miles around. 
Since there was close to no civilian flights, most of its
functions were military - which is why no-one was surprised
when a call came from two damaged Veritechs, including one on
the verge of disintegrating into its component parts.
  "Lewis, what's their ETA?"
  Lewis turned around towards the Chief Controller and flipped
through his calculations.  "Approximately two minutes.  We've
cleared runway five and placed all emergency services along
it.  Unless it crashes into the city, we should be able to
save the pilot."
  "Good.  Just make sure you don't send them on a collision
course with the SDF."  His eyes turned back to the middle of
Lake Gloval, a few hundred meters away from the tower.  "I
always said it was a bad idea to build this airport so close
to this pile of junk that passes off for a Battle-Fortress."
  Lewis did not respond - this was the third time this shift
he'd heard the complaint, ever since a plane had mistakenly
been diverted on a collision course towards the bridge of the
old Fortress.
  "Planes on approach.  Two Veritechs confirmed... Skull Five,
Skull Thirteen, do you read me?"
  The speaker crackled into life as both pilots answered back.
  "Skull Thirteen to Tower, request emergency approach."
  "Roger Skull Thirteen, approach is clear on runway five. 
There is no other traffic in the vicinity so don't worry if
you have to over-shoot and try again.  Medics and firemen have
been placed all along the runway and are ready to assist you. 
Do you copy?"
  "Roger Tower, coming in.  Heads up down there!"
  Lewis looked out the window and saw a pile of junk make its
approach onto runway five.  The pile of junk extended landing
gears and thus identified itself as Skull Thirteen.  The Chief
Controller suddenly gave a grunt of surprise, dropped the
binoculars he was using and grabbed the nearest microphone.
  "Skull Thirteen, abort!  Abort!  Your left landing gear is
not fully extended."
  "Negative Tower, cannot over-shoot the runway.  My engines
are about to go and my brakes just gave up the ghost.  If I
don't buy the farm on this one Michael, I'll buy you lunch."
  "You've got it." said the other pilot.  "Just you make sure
you're in one piece for our date."
  "As you wish.  Attention Tower, this is Skull Thirteen on
final approach.  I'm coming in hot so make sure your people
mind their heads when I land."
  "Roger Skull Thirteen... and good luck."
  The Veritech trembled as it descended onto the tarmac.  Its
wheels cried out as the asphalt ripped away some of their
rubber.  The jet started to slow down as the engines were
reversed.  With the sudden loss of speed came the loss of the
balance that kept the plane upright - the left landing gear
touched the ground and folded back into the body of the jet. 
Skull Thirteen seemed to hang in mid-air then dipped towards
the ground.  Its left wing clipped the grass on the side of
the runway and the plane was flung in circles down the rest of
the runway, coming to rest a few hundred meters later. 
Emergency crews were already drowning the plane in foam to
prevent a fire from starting whilst medics tried to open the
cockpit.  The pilot was crouched inside, head resting on her
shoulder, eyes closed, blood seeping from her nose.
  "Tower, this is Skull Five... How is she doing?"
  "Tower to Skull Five.  The medics are just taking her out of
the cockpit and into the ambulance.  I can't see how bad it is
from here."
  "Thank you Tower.  Skull Five requesting approach vectors."
  "Roger Skull Five, runway eighteen is clear for landing. 
You have priority."
  "Understood Tower.  Warn the hospital I'll be over as soon
as I can.  Skull Five on final approach."
  Lewis transferred Skull Five to another controller and
turned towards the Chief Controller.  "What do you think her
chances are Harry?"
  "Difficult to say from here.  I've seen people survive a
fall without parachute from a thousand feet.  I've also seen
people die from tripping on the last step of a staircase.  I'd
say it all depends on how strong her will to live is."
  "Well, there's nothing more we can do about it." said Lewis,
pointing to the tarmac.  "The medics just took her away.  What
do we do with the wreck?"
  Harry glanced at the runway.  "Leave it where it is for the
moment.  The runway's been scored so deeply it's unusable
anyway."
  Lewis turned to his instruments and plugged his headphone
back in.  A moment later he turned back in surprise and
gestured towards Harry.  "Harry, I think you'd better listen
to this."  He flicked a switch and the master speaker hummed
with power.  A voice came through, a voice they had heard not
long ago.
  "...C'mon guys, how about some service?  My left side is
killing me and I've got hydraulics leaking all over my body. 
Yo, Tower, can you read me?...  Tower, this is Skull Thirteen. 
How long are you going to leave me to rot in this sun?  I know
I'm in bad shape but I ain't totalled yet.  Can anybody hear
me?..."
  Harry and Lewis looked at each other for a long time, then
turned towards the runway, towards a plane wrecked on it - a
plane that was complaining of lack of service, a plane that
was talking in its pilot's voice.

                           CHAPTER 6

  I mean, what do you do with somebody whose brainwaves don't
register but whose body refuses to die?  We didn't know.  So
we decided to put her on ice, on observation.  We hooked her
up to every apparatus you could name, and then some.  And
still all they told us was she was brain dead.  So you can
imagine our surprise when this happened!
         Unnamed orderly at the New Macross Military Hospital.


  The darkness was surrounding her, closing in on her from all
sides.  She fought with it until she felt she would die,
suffocated by the impenetrable blackness.  She finally gave up
and waited for something to happen.  She didn't have to wait
very long.
  "Hello."  The voice was very soothing, very syrupy, almost
annoying.  She looked about, trying to find its source.
  "I said 'hello'.  Are you so impolite as not to answer?" the
voice enquired.
  Michele gulped before answering in a faltering voice. 
"Hello."
  "That's much better.  Welcome Michele!" the voice boomed
throughout the darkness.
  "How do you know my name?"
  "I know all there is to know about you - including the fact
you seem to have an affinity for landing yourself in
hospitals."  The voice chuckled.  "You do not seem to be at
ease."
  "I am claustrophobic.  This darkness is smothering me."
  "Ah!  Well, this can be arranged."  The lights came on
abruptly.  Where she had been floating were now ceiling, floor
and walls.  Two plush seats were waiting next to a chimney in
which sizzled a warm fire.  "Please take a seat."  Michele
tested the seat before she settled.  It was real.
  "Is this any better?" the voice enquired.
  "Yes, much better thank you.  Who are you?"
  "Good!  Abrupt and to the point, I like that.  My name would
tell you nothing."
  "Show yourself then."  Michele cried out, searching the room
for the source of the voice.
  "Oh, very well."
  A shadow began to form on the seat in front of hers.  The
shadow took form and substance nearly immediately.  Michele
jumped to her feet and grasped at her hip for a weapon that
wasn't there.  In front of her, straight out of a religious
book she had once read, was the Devil.

  Hausthar had finally changed into his uniform and was
digging into a hearty breakfast when the sun decided to rise
and send its warm rays through the windows.  Ricky stepped
through the door of the kitchenette, once again wearing her
leotard.  She walked over to Hausthar and gave him a peck on
the cheek.
  "Good morning!  Had a nice sleep?"  Try as he might to stop
it, her smile was growing on him.
  Hausthar harumphed.  "Yes...  How did I get back here last
night?  More importantly, how did you get in here?"
  "Well, you were having such a good time at the club, when
suddenly your face went blank and you nose-dived into your
Petite Cola pyramid.  A couple of the pilots there helped me
get you into a cab and it drove us back to the base.  As for
my getting in, the guard threw one look at you and ushered us
in.  When I looked back at him, he was busy dialling a number
on his phone.  Happy?"  She threw two slices of bread in the
toaster and sat on the chair in front of him.
  Hausthar ate the last of his toast in silence and got up. 
"Yeah, I s'pose.  Listen, I've got flying duty today, so could
you close the door behind you when you leave."  Funny how his
heart was cringing at the thought of her leaving while his
brain was all against the idea of her staying.
  "Sure! Have a good time."  She got up to retrieve her toasts
and turned to face him as he was stepping through the door. 
"Please be careful." she said in a low voice.  She briefly
looked him in the eyes, then went back to the table and
buttered her toast.
  Hausthar looked at her, puzzled.  He eventually shrugged in
defeat and closed the door behind him as he left.

  "Are... are you the Devil?"
  "Oh no." the Entity replied.  "I simply took this image from
your mind.  <Devil>, eh?  I must admit I like his style! 
Please, please, sit down.  There is nothing worse than to
speak to someone who insists on standing up."
  Michele slowly made her way back to her seat.  She noticed
that the Entity was not completely there, that parts of It
were shadowy.  As if reading her mind, the Entity spoke.  "The
shadowy parts are the areas of this body whose descriptions I
could not properly get from your memory.  Most annoying - I do
so hate messy solutions."
  "You still haven't answered my question: how do you know my
name?"
  The Entity looked surprised.  "But my dear, I thought it
would have been obvious to you by now - I've read your mind. 
I know all there is to know about you.  For example, the red
tinge in your hair is real, you have a strong liking for your
new wingman, and you have a birth-mark on your..."
  "All right, I believe you!  No need to sprout personal
details.  Don't you have any decency?"
  "Mmm... no, I don't believe I have."
  "Oh great!  Which still leaves me in the dark.  Who are you
and where am I?"  Michele nearly shouted her last question.
  The Entity gave a small sigh and dug into a non-existent
pocket.  When It withdrew Its hand, It was holding two photos. 
"I guess the best way to present myself would be to start with
the rest of my 'family'."  It handed the first photograph to
Michele.  It pictured a tall man, dressed in a long white
robe, with white hair and a white beard.  A light shone around
his head in a halo, obscuring his feature.  The effect was,
well, Godly.  "Yes, I know what this looks like - you must
remember that I am trying to pull images from your memory and
imagination that will suit.  And I am sure that this goody-
two-shoes egomaniac would enjoy being represented thus."
  It handed over the second picture to Michele.  It was rather
different from the first, though certainly just as surprising. 
"This one is the third of our group.  Whereas my 'brother' and
I live in a quite spiritual plane, this one can be found in
the physical world."  Michele did not know what to make of the
picture - surely this had to be a joke!  The Entity withdrew
the pictures and replaced them both in his pocket.
  "To once again take analogies and names from your memory, I
am called Neo.  The names of the other two are not important
at this point.  Let's just say that we three represent the
perfect trinity of Good, Evil and Neutral."  It shifted
slightly in Its seat.  "So much for who I am.  As for your
second question... " Neo pointed at her head.  "We're inside
your brain.  Or what's left of it at the moment."
  "What do you mean <what's left of it>?" enquire Michele.
  "It seems your medical people can't quite decide whether you
are dead or not.  Your brain shows no sign of activity but
your body refuses to die.  These simpletons should never have
graduated out of kindergarten!"
  Michele's face had drained with the news of her physical
condition.  Neo used the silence to once again dig into Its
non-existent breast pocket and pulled out a lit pipe.  "I'm
sorry, I forgot to ask.  Do you mind if I smoke?"  Michele
shook her head, still trying to come to terms with the
revelation.  "Thank you.  Nasty habit, smoking, but I just
can't seem to get rid of it.  I picked it up by studying one
of your kind.  I believe you now him - Admiral Gloval. 
Charming chap!  I just wished he'd be a little more nasty
sometimes."  It pulled on Its pipe in silence for a moment,
then suddenly brought it down.
  "Aha, it seems you have a visitor."  Neo pointed towards a
mirror which had just appeared above the fireplace.  Michele
looked into it and saw herself lying in a hospital bed, with
all sort of equipment strapped to her.  A shiver ran up and
down her spine.
  The door to the room opened and one of the hospital's
doctors walked in backward, hands in the air, and bumped into
the nurse that was tending to the electronic gear.  A voice
came from outside the room.
  "Listen doctor, I said I was going in to see her, and go in
I damn well will!"
  The doctor retreated even further into the room and a figure
appeared, holding a gun loosely towards him.
  "Michael!" shouted Michele, half out of her seat.  Michael
did not seem to notice her.  "Michael?!... Damn it Michael,
answer me!"
  Neo took another puff from Its pipe.  "I'm afraid that he
can't hear you.  As far as he's concerned, you are lying on
that hospital bed."
  Michael had by then escorted both the doctor and the nurse
out of the room and locked the door shut.  He came back and
sat on the edge of the bed, staring at Michele's prostrate
body.  He reached out and took her hand, holding it tight. 
"C'mon partner, don't quit on me now.  Who's gonna save my ass
next time if you go?"  He stooped over her body and brushed
back her hair into place, caressing her cheek as he did so.
  Inside the other room, Michele gasped - she had felt Michael
squeeze her hand.  She had felt him brush back her hair and
touch her cheek.  Her hand went up to her face, to where his
hand had been, and for the first time in as long as she could
remember, Michele cried.

  Hausthar walked up to the hangar where the new Veritech was
stored.  He was supposed to test it today, to push its
envelope until it finally gave way.  It was not a task he was
looking forward to.
  "Hey, George - you in there?"  He peered into the darkness
of the hangar and spied a shape moving towards him.  George
was the main engineer of Research, and the two of them had met
the day after Hausthar's transfer.  It hadn't taken long for
the two of them to realise they both enjoyed talking about the
new Mecha.
  "Hausthar, long time no see."  A tall man emerged from the
shadows of the hangar, wiping his hands on a dirty cloth - no
matter how modern the engines, they still managed to soil up
anybody tinkering with them.  "I heard you were taking Alpha
One up for a spin today.  I'll have my men prepare her for
you.  She's a mean looking bitch.  You think you can handle
her?"
  Hausthar laughed.  "I hope so.  Don't mind telling you my
insides are in a knot.  This is my first flight on an untested
ship."
  "Don't worry - they nearly all make it back the first time
out."
  "<Nearly?!>"  Hausthar was gaping at him, trying to figure
out if George was being serious.
  "Once you are up there" continued George "you won't have
time to worry."  He slapped Hausthar on the back and went back
inside the hangar.

  Neo looked at the girl in front of It, bent in two on her
seat, tears spilling from her eyes.  "<Ahem.>  I do believe it
is time to talk business."
  Michele stopped crying and turned her blood-shot eyes toward
It.  She sniffed a couple of times before answering.  "What do
you want from me?"
  "Your soul!"

  Alpha One was the first prototype in a new series of
Veritech - it was smaller than the old VF-series, but still
not as small as the design team would have liked.  Gone was
the old VF-14 look: Alpha One had two gigantic engines
occupying all of the plane's undercarriage and two smaller
engines up top, near the wings.  Also a great departure from
the old VF design was the dropping of the laser weaponry and
the incorporation of internal missile launchers into several
areas the plane's body.  Research had told Hausthar that by
the time they had the design perfected they would be able to
store between forty to seventy missiles all over the plane. 
Included in the new design was a new version of the GU-11 gun
pod, the still-unnamed GU-XX.  Hausthar wasn't too happy about
the lack of an energy-based weapon, laser or otherwise.  His
main concern was what would happen to the pilot once the
plane's ammunitions had been spent.  Research's answer had
been that if the Alpha had to stay in the fray long enough for
all its ammo to be used, then the armor and shields would
probably have given way long before.  Not a comforting thought
for pilots.
  But for this flight Alpha One would be going weaponless. 
Hausthar's job was to push the prototype to its limits and
beyond, and hopefully survive when it finally snagged.  As he
taxied the plane towards the runway, it occurred to him that
he had forgotten the routine visual check-up that was normally
part of the pre-flight operations.  Neither had he checked to
see if they had packed his parachute.
  The Tower gave him a green light on departure and Hausthar's
worries were left behind as the plane rocketed down the runway
and went ballistic a few seconds later.  He reached the
testing corridor within a couple of minutes and started to
relay information to the control Tower.  A voice came over the
tactical net as he finished, a voice hauntingly familiar.
  "Hausthar?  You have been given the green light.  Start your
run."
  Hausthar recognised the voice - it was Lang's.  But Dr. Lang
never bothered to come watch the testing of new Mecha!  What
was he doing here?  Had Lang come for him?  Why was he so
important to Lang?  Hausthar's mind was full of questions as
he rogered the order and began to push the throttle forward.
  The plane's twin main engines roared into life as power
reached them.  The Veritech lurched forward and began to form
the well-known cone of noise as it approached Mach-1.  Inside
the cockpit, Hausthar was reading off the instruments into the
Net, more to calm his nerves than for those listening.
  "Mach one.  Mach one point five.  Mach two.  Mach two point
five.  Mach three.  Slight buffeting starting to gain
intensity.  Computer has just engaged secondary engines to
counter-balance.  Mach three point five.  Mach four.  Heat
reading on the nose cone reaching maximum tolerance.  Plane
controls are starting to rebel.  Mach four point five... "
  The plane gave a sickening lurch as an explosion occurred
somewhere down the left side of the body.  Warning buzzers
filled the cockpit with their death songs.  "Tower do you read
me?  I have a malfunction in the port engine followed by
explosion and loss of compression.  Hydraulic pressure to the
port control surfaces is dropping fast.  Both secondary
engines and main starboard engine are locked at maximum. 
Repeat, all remaining engines are locked at maximum.  Over." 
More buzzers filled the air of the cockpit.  Hausthar didn't
even take the time to turn them off.
  "We copy Alpha One.  Initiate bail-out procedure."
  "Roger Tower, bailing out."  Hausthar reached for the
ejection handle and prayed that he wouldn't be smashed by the
plane's speed.  He pulled on the handle.
  "Tower, this is Alpha one.  I have a malfunction in the
ejection mechanism probably due to previous problem.  Can you
help?"
  "Alpha One, do you have report of a fire in the port main
engine?"
  "Roger that Tower, fire warning is on for port main engine. 
Request procedure to dump this heap o' shit."
  Hausthar heard several curses being said, then a voice
Hausthar did not expect to hear.  "Hausthar, this is Victor. 
Open your main computer console.  We'll try to shut off the
remaining engines and have you bring the plane down by
gliding."
  Hausthar reached for his emergency toolkit and pulled out
the appropriate screwdriver.  He had the panel open in no time
at all.  "Victor, main computer panel open, awaiting
instructions."
  Lang's voice replaced Victor's.  "Locate the starboard main
engine's fuel control chip and short circuit it by cross
connecting with any Delta circuit."
  Hausthar took out a probe from the kit, located the
appropriate circuits and jammed it between them.  Sparks
showered the cockpit in a brief display of pyrotechnics.
  "Tower, this is Alpha One.  Procedure accomplished and
engine shorted out.  Secondary systems suffered damage from
procedure though."
  "Got it Alpha One.  Can you give us a list of the systems
that went down?"
  "Systems include pursuit radar, starboard missile launchers,
mechamorphosys circuits and landing gear.  I repeat, both
automatic <and> manual controls for the landing gears are
down."
  Victor's voice sounded resigned.  "Roger Alpha One.  You are
going to have to ditch her into the sea.  Can you give us a
relative position for touch down?"
  "I think I'll splash down somewhere south of Tokyo Bay.  I'd
estimate ten klicks or so."
  "Got it Alpha One - we are sending a ship to pick you up. 
God's speed."
  Hausthar felt his throat close up - if Victor was going
theological on him, things must be bleak indeed.  "Thank you
Tower.  Out."
  Hausthar's plane was beginning to break apart when it
finally reached the touch-down area.  Buzzers were once again
filling the cockpit, warning him that he was either flying too
low or driving too fast.  Hausthar felt a pang of regret as he
realised he might never again see Ricky.  He didn't have time
to think anything more - the plane hit the water at well above
the recommended speed.  It bounced several times across the
small waves and finally came to a bone-wrenching stop in the
middle of a wave.  Before the next wave reached it, it had
disappeared beneath the surface, leaving nothing but a few
wreckages and an oil slick to mark the fact that a tragedy had
occurred.

  "You want... my soul?" Michele asked incredulously. 
Thoughts of Hell and Eternal Damnation filled her mind. 
Apparently Neo had also picked them up for It was quick to
retort.
  "No, no, no.  Not like that.  I think I have chosen the
wrong words.  I desire your... co-operation.  Is that better? 
Yes, co-operation.  I want you to join my cause and help me in
my fight."  It was waving Its pipe excitedly.
  "Let me get this straight.  You want my help?  But aren't
you evil?"
  "Yes on both count.  Although Evil is a very relative
concept.  What might be Evil to you is perfectly normal to me. 
May I also add that such help or co-operation, call it what
you will, would be rewarded with Power.  Power such as you
have never dreamed of before - Power to destroy your enemies
before they can even sense your presence.  This is the reward
I offer you.  And all you have to do is follow my directives." 
It leaned back into Its chair and started to pull on the pipe
again, filling the air around It with smoke.
  Michele was looking at the mirror, watching Michael fuss
over her unconscious body, trying to bring her out of her
coma.  For this was what she had decided was happening - she
must have gone into coma and was dreaming all of this.
  "I'll need time to think about this."  she told Neo.
  Neo smiled at her.  "Of course.  Take all the time in the
world.  I'll always be around if you need me.  All you'll ever
need to do is accept me in."  Neo stood up and approached her
chair, Its body towering above her.  "Now it is time for you
to go back, Michele Cequor."  It waived Its hand toward her
and she felt herself begin to dissolve

  Michael was still stooped over Michele's body, oblivious to
the pounding on the room's door.  He was pushing back more
hair from her face and brushing her cheek softly when he felt
two strong arms encircle his heck and pull him down.  Warm
lips rose to meet his as Michele put all she had to offer into
their first kiss.

                           CHAPTER 7

  Of course, in retrospect, it is very easy to see why this
had all happened.  The changes in moods also become
understandable.  But then again, everyone has 20/20 hindsight! 
Why did I not understand?  Why did I not realise that two such
crashes in so short a time could not be coincidental?  We
might as well just shorten it and get back to the eternal
question - <Why>.  In younger days I would have said that this
was the will of the Shaping and left it at that.  How little
did I know then about it and about the person who had
unleashed it on an unsuspecting galaxy, this Haydon.  Rem
keeps on telling me that the Haydon I imagine never existed. 
He seems bizarre lately, as if a conflict is raging inside
him.  It is that conflict which made me think back to those
days of trial-and-error.  I can still hear him pacing in his
cabin, shouting "Leave me be!  I didn't want any of this to be
thrust upon me!  Why can't you leave me alone?"  His
personality is changing, changing just like those of Hausthar
and Michele did - but, I fear, for the worse.

  This was starting to get monotonous - black on black
surrounded by black.  What had happened to the colour scheme? 
Hausthar looked around.  This is not how he had imagined the
bottom of the ocean.  And where <was> that rescue ship?
  A light flared off in the distance, as if to answer him. 
The rescue ship - at last!  Hausthar waited for the light to
come closer.  And waited.  And waited still.  It finally
dawned on him that the light was not moving.
  "Hey, over here!" he shouted, not really hoping to be heard.
  "Ah, there you are.  For a moment there I thought I'd lost
you.  You can come out now."  The voice sounded middle-aged
and sure of itself - so sure in fact that Hausthar had popped
the seals on his canopy before remembering he was still
underwater.  Surprisingly, he met no resistance when he tried
to open the canopy, and no water tried to force entry.
  Hausthar jumped down from his Veritech.  Something was
illuminating both him and the Mecha, but would reveal neither
ground nor sky, nor anything else for that matter.  With no
other apparent options, Hausthar started towards the light he
had originally spied.

  The light turned out to be a window, about three feet off
the ground, just hanging in mid-air.  Looking through the
window Hausthar was confronted with a scene straight out of
nineteenth Century England.  Horse-drawn carriages were making
their way down a street - Baker street, if the signs were to
be trusted - while people dressed for the part moved about
their business one floor below his.  Hausthar gazed for a
while, then stepped to look behind the window, from the side. 
No street presented itself, just the same impenetrable
darkness.  He went back to the window and peered through - the
street was still there.
  The sound of a violin drifted by from behind, the scratchy
sound of an instrument played very amateurly - it sounded more
like a fight between cats.  Something tugged at the corner of
his mind.  <A violin, Baker street.  Then could it be that
this is..?>
  "221b Baker street, my abode - exactly!" the voice echoed
behind him.  Hausthar turned around and was confronted by a
tall, thin man dressed in light brown trousers and white
shirt, fighting with a violin in an effort to get music from
it.  "Congratulations young man.  Good deductions, even if
they were a little slow.  I say, are you sure I'm supposed to
play this badly?"  The man's eyebrows collided with each
other.
  Hausthar gasped for breath as he tried to answer.  "Er... No
sir... That is, I don't think so... That is, I can't
remember."
  The man looked him in the eye for a moment then breathed a
sigh of resignation.  "I was afraid of that."  He positioned
the violin back on his shoulder and began to play - very badly
- a Minuet in G Hausthar had heard recently.  "Do you know who
I am?" the figure asked.
  By this time Hausthar had regained some of his sense.  "I
know who you look like." he answered.
  "Good!  Very good!  Never make any judgement until you are
certain you have all the facts.  I made that mistake several
times myself you know."  He stopped playing the violin and
placed it back in its case.  "Now, down to business."  The man
squatted down and a Victorian-era armchair appeared under him. 
"Please, take a seat."
  Hausthar noticed that a similar seat had appeared just
behind him.  It looked real enough.  He tested this theory by
sitting in it.  "Are you really... him?"
  "Sherlock Holmes?  Oh, dear me, no!  Not at all."
  "Then why did you...?"
  "Take his appearance?  Elementary my dear Hausthar - I
needed something you would not be afraid of, and this seemed
perfect for my needs."  He reached towards his left and took a
pipe from a table that had materialised under his hand.  He
filled, then lit it whilst talking.  "I also wanted to make a
good impression and I must admit I liked this personality. 
Ah, the adventures Mr. Holmes had!  But this is secondary to
my immediate problem."  Holmes - or rather the person which
looked like Holmes - leaned forward in his seat.  "You see, I
need your help."
  "My help sir?  How so?"
  Holmes dug into his pocket, pulled out a photograph and
handed it to Hausthar.  "Moriarty is on the loose again!"

  Michele was re-arranging her pillows for the third time in
as many minutes.  The Sterlings were supposed to arrive soon
and she wanted to make herself as presentable as possible. 
<Damn those medics for not allowing me to get up!>
  A surreptitious knock came from the door.  At Michele's
beckon the door opened and both Max and Miriya Sterling came
through, Max bearing flowers.  As usual, he was wearing his
smile, but Miriya was showing a look of concern.
  "Hello Michele, how are you doing?"
  Michele told herself to be cheerful and forced a smile to
appear on her lips.  "As well as can be expected given the
circumstances, sir.  Do you know why the medics won't release
me?"
  Maximillian, busy putting the flowers into a vase, was
visibly startled by the question.  His smile even flickered
off for a brief moment.  "I don't know.  But it really doesn't
matter, does it?"
  Miriya stepped closer to the bed.  "It's a pity you won't be
able to join us."
  "Join you?"  Michele looked up to Maximillian.  "What is
going on Commander?"
  Max gave out a small sigh.  "First of all my rank of
Commander was only temporary - I am back to Lieutenant. 
Second, what Miriya means is that we are going out into
space."
  "Why?  What's going on?"  Michele's voice was on the verge
of tears.
  "A Robotech Automated Factory has been discovered.  It is
still manned by non-allied Zentraedi.  The Skull and the Night
Music squadrons have been asked to investigate - we're leaving
this afternoon."
  Michele's voice was frantic, two pearls of water forming on
the edges of her eyes.  "But... but you can't leave me here! 
You just <can't>.  You have to take me along!"
  Maximillian's smile had disappeared and his face was now
mimicking Miriya's look of concern.  "The doctors feel it to
be in your best interest if you were to stay here a little
while longer.  Rick agrees with it."
  Tears now flowed openly on Michele's face.  "But why?  Why?"
  Max stood there, not knowing what to say.  Miriya stepped
forward, sat on the edge of the bed and placed her arm around
Michele's shoulders.  "I know what you feel.  It is the way I
felt when I gave birth to Dana.  It is hard to spend your time
in bed when you feel you should be up there with your
wingmates.  All you can do is grit your teeth and wait for
your time."
  Michele gave a sob and buried her head in Miriya's shoulder
to weep in anger.

  "I'm sorry Dr. Lang, I just can't seem to be able to do it
right."
  Lang looked at the remnants of the egg, a shapeless mass of
clear and yellow goo.  "It's okay Michele."  He placed a new
egg on the ground.  "We have plenty of spares.  Let's try
again, shall we?"  He stepped back out of the way.
  A Mecha's hand extended itself from the Guardian and moved
towards the egg.  Fingers the size of telegraph poles
surrounded the egg and moved in to pick it up.  The shell gave
way and splattered its yolk and white.
  "<DAMN!>"  A metal-shod fist whizzed through the air and
impacted with the wall in frustration, threatening to bring
down the building.  "Why can't I do this right?"
  Lang came back into view, followed by several other
technicians and scientists.  "It's all right my dear - after
all, you just came through a traumatic experience.  Let's
forget about the eggs and concentrate on your memory for a
while."
  The Veritech in front of the scientists mechamorphed from
Guardian to Battloid and sat on the floor with its back
against the wall.  "What do you want to know?"
  One of the personnel behind Lang opened a notebook.  "Well,
how about your name for a start?"
  "Easy.  My name is Michele Cequor.  Any more trivial
questions?"  The Veritech shifted slightly to a better sitting
position.
  "What happened just prior to and after the explosion?"
  "Well, I remember being chased by the missile.  I didn't
want both of us to blow up in the middle of the city, so I
lured it as far out as I could.  I'd just cleared the city
when the explosion occurred.  The next thing I know, Michael
is screaming in my ears, wanting to know what had happened and
what my status was.  I told him the bad news and we got sent
off to New Macross ASAP.  When we got there I managed to land. 
I was surrounded by hundreds of medics and firemen - all these
people, and do you think they'd do anything for me?  They just
left me there to rot on the runway until I complained and you
came along Dr. Lang."
  The person with the notebook was writing frantically.  A
woman close to him was next with the questions.  "What about
during the explosion?  What were your thoughts?"
  Once again, the Mecha shifted uneasily.  "I remember
panicking, thinking I was going to die and trying to fight it. 
I could feel the computer reaching out in despair as its sub-
systems were dying out one by one.  I remember mentally
grabbing hold of that part of the computer which was still
functioning and crying in helplessness.  That's when I blacked
out."  The Battloid's hand wiped its 'eyes' and grabbed hold
of its other shoulder, in a gesture of defenselessness.
  "And what about your present condition?"  asked the man with
the notebook.  "What do you make of it?"
  The Veritech grabbed its knees and pulled them in, like a
child searching for protection.  "I don't know.  I really
don't.  Maybe I got merged with the Veritech during the blast. 
Maybe I replaced the computer when it died.  All I know is
that I am Michele - <I am alive!>  So why am I being kept
inside this hangar?  Where is my body Dr. Lang?"
  Lang looked up past the pulled-in knees to the faceplate of
the Battloid and stared long and deep into it.  "You are being
kept in surveillance because of the shock you have suffered. 
The reason you are kept in this hangar is because there is no
hospital bed, or in fact hospital, big enough to fit you.  As
for your body..."  Lang paused.  "We are still running some
tests on it to find out what happened."
  The Veritech sat there silently.  When it finally spoke its
voice contained a tremor that had not been there before.  "I'm
sorry Dr. Lang.  If only you knew what it was like.  I wake up
every day and wonder why my eyes are over fifty feet from the
ground.  I try to eat but have to remember to plug myself in
for a recharge instead.  I just can't take it anymore!"  The
Veritech's head lowered itself onto its knees and the Battloid
emitted strange short sounds, its shoulders raked by spasms.
  It took Lang a good four seconds to realise the Veritech was
crying.

  A head protruded at right angle from the door frame.  "Are
they gone?" it asked.
  Michele finished drying her tears and threw away the paper
handkerchief she had been using.  "Yeah, come in Victor."
  Victor squeezed his body through the door's frame and made
his way to her bed.  "If you feel like you look, I wouldn't
want to be in your shoes - you look terrible!"
  Michele sniffed.  "I feel even worse.  Not only did I stuff-
up on my first sortie, not only did I make a fool of myself in
front of my commanding officer, not only have I been ordered
to bed duties for an indefinite amount of time, but thanks to
this little accident I'll miss my first outing in space."  Her
clenched fists relaxed slowly.  "It's nice to see you again."
she admitted.
  Victor made embarrassed little noises and overly shuffled
his feet.  "Aw, shucks!  'Twas nothin' really."  Testing a
chair for robustness he opted to sit on the floor next to the
bed, his head still at eye-level with hers.  "I just couldn't
leave my little sister alone in a big hospital, now could I?"
  Victor had been the one who had rescued Michele from the
wreckage of Macross City two years ago in the SDF-1.  Ever
since, he had looked after the orphan girl as if she had been
his little sister, making sure she re-enlisted into the
Academy, and helping her through long nights of study.  He was
the best friend she ever had, except for...
  Michele shook her head.  Now was not the time to think of
Michael.  "And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?"
she enquired.
  Victor shuffled his way towards the bed.  "I am here to make
sure you recover that cute little smile I always enjoyed."
  Michele's face fell even further.  "I am sorry Victor, I
just don't feel up to smiling right now."
  "In that case, I'll have to use extreme measures."  He got
up to his feet and started to unbolt a plate from his arm.
  Michele looked up in surprise.  "Victor, don't you dare! 
Not now!  <Please!?>"  A small mechanical arm unfolded itself
and extended towards the bed, reaching for her body.  "Victor,
I mean it!"  She tried to avoid the arm but was too slow.  The
arm made its way up and down her ribs, finding well known
spots in its waves of tickles.  "VICTOR!?!  <Stop> it!!"  She
was laughing hard by now, and was about to slide from the bed
when the arm retracted.  The laughter abated.
  "Thanks, I needed that."
  "Always happy to oblige."  Victor sat on the edge of her
bed.  A straining groan echoed through the room for a moment
and then became a memory.  "Now what's this I hear about you
and Michael Circle?"
  Michele tried to subdue a new fit of laughter.  "Now why did
I ever think I could keep this from you?  How did you find
out?"
  "I have my sources.  Well, is it true?"
  Michele leaned back, a smile reappearing on her face.  "Yes,
it is.  What do you want to know?"
  "Everything!"
  Laughter echoed through the thankfully empty halls of the
hospital.

  Hausthar gazed at the picture he had been given.  "Mo...
Moriarty?"
  "Oh, I'm sorry.  I got into my role too much."  Holmes sat
back and pulled on his pipe a couple of times before
continuing.  "You see, a long time ago an alien scientist
discovered a way to produce a new, clean energy.  He named it
Protoculture.  I was, of course, very flattered that he had
chosen this name... but the Energy derived by this process has
nothing to do with me - or should I say it has everything to
do with me?"  He blew smoke to the ceiling.  "You see, there
has always been three of us - Good, Evil and Neutrality
keeping the balance.  We had been dormant for several eons
when this discoverer suddenly awakened us.  Not since Haydon
had taught the Invids how to use the Flowers had we seen such
an intellect."  The man calling himself Holmes was looking
through Hausthar, into the past, reliving memories.
  "Neo was the first to regain full capabilities, and used the
time it had at its disposal very well I'm afraid.  You see, we
cannot act on the physical plane, not without great strain. 
We have to use agents to do our work.  When necessary, we can
use the Energy derived from the Flower of Life to act swiftly
and decisively, but it is a drastic measure which requires the
agreement of us all.  My agents were the Invids, at least
until I slumbered - without my guidance some strayed to the
other side.  Neo took control of the scientist's race and had
them remove the pollinators, small dog-like animals with a
rather high intelligence, from the Invid orchards.  This
enraged the Invids, creating more converts.  Slowly I was
loosing my flock, balance could no longer be kept.  I had to
try to make amends, to restore it.  Thus came the Robotech War
as you know it."
  "And did you win?"  Hausthar asked.
  "Yes and no.  I won the first match, barely.  But you know
what they say - best out of three, It's not over until the fat
lady sings and all that.  I am afraid your Earth will become a
battlefield for more physical and psychic wars before balance
is once again restored.  I can already feel my nemesis working
against me.  He has prepared re-inforcements and is about to
send them a signal flare."
  "How?"
  "Your forces are on their way to capture a Robotech
Automated Factory and bring it to Earth.  When the Factory
defolds into Earth orbit, the displacement in the Energy will
pinpoint the Earth to the Robotech Masters and come they
will."
  "But can't you stop it?"
  "How I have tried!  But my agents believe they are acting
for the benefit of all concerned."
  "So?  What has that got to do with it?"
  "My boy, haven't you been listening to anything I have been
saying?  We, I, do not exist!  We are merely the psychic
projections of the actions being done in the physical world. 
Every time someone commits 'evil' in your world, Neo becomes
stronger and more apt to shape events to its own choosing. 
And the same thing applies to 'good' and me.  Our powers
depend on the application of the Energy derived from the
Flower.  That is why I cannot stop your forces - they truly
believe in what they are doing!  They think it is the best
course of action.  Little do they realise that the
spacefolding of the Factory will attract the Masters to Earth
like moths to a flame.  Except that in this case, I'm afraid,
<they> will be the flame that will bring Earth's demise." 
Holmes turned towards the window, visibly annoyed.  "Isn't it
possible to have a conversation without being disturbed?" he
shouted.
  Hausthar, taken aback by the abruptness of the comment,
looked through the window and was surprised to see the
interior of a hospital room.  In the bed was a figure, so
covered with life-support systems that it was hard to tell its
gender, much less its identity.  The door to the room opened
and a man in overalls shuffled in, obviously not at ease. 
Hausthar immediately recognised him.
  "George!" he cried out.  The man in the hospital room did
not even start, as though the words had not reached him.  In
fact, he was moving towards the bed.
  George looked at the figure in the bed and sighed deeply. 
"They tell me there's a chance you can hear me.  They also
tell me you might not make it out.  So I just have to tell
you... I'm to blame for your accident."  He paused and cleared
his throat a couple of times before going on.  "You see, one
of my mechanics was working on your engine, bolting back a
panel that had been removed for maintenance, and he decided to
take an early lunch.  By the time I came back, you were
already gone."  George's head hung low.  "The bolts were not
properly tightened and must have hit the engine with enough
force to rip it to shreds."
  A loud sniffle was heard in the room.  George took out a
handkerchief and wiped his nose, his face flowing with tears
of self-recrimination.  "If I'd only checked and made sure,
this wouldn't have happened!  If you ever come out of it, I'll
try to make it up to you, I really will!"
  He replaced the handkerchief in his pocket and stood there,
arms limp.  "I got to go.  I'll see you later, eh?"  Walking
towards the door, he opened it and stood in front of it.  He
turned one last time towards the bed and said "Goodbye
Hausthar."
  Hausthar was so shocked he never notice George's departure
nor the closing of the door.  "<Hausthar?!>  You mean that's
me under there?"
  Holmes was quietly puffing smoke into the air.  "My boy, you
will recall I never said anything on that subject.  But now
that you raise the point, yes it is you."  Hausthar was still
staring through the window, eyes locked on the figure in the
bed.  "This brings me back to our earlier conversation -"
continued Holmes, "I need your help."  Hausthar was oblivious
to all but the hospital bed and had not responded. 
"HAUSTHAR!"
  Jumping in alarm Hausthar stammered  "Yes... er... my
help... How so?"
  Holmes was once again smiling.  "You are repeating yourself
my friend," he pointed out, "but it does not matter.  What I
require is your help to stop the possible catastrophes which
might follow the arrival of the Factory in Earthspace.  I
cannot do it myself."  Hausthar opened his mouth as if to
reply but was promptly cut off.  "Now I realise this is not a
decision to be lightly made, so I will give you time to think
about it.  I shall therefore send you back whence you came. 
But first..."  The violin magically reappeared in Holmes'
hands.  "I have a symphony or two I would like you to listen
to."  The languid sound of the wooden instrument filled the
air.

  When Hausthar finally awoke, he was instantly aware of
several factors - first of all, most of the life-support
equipment had been unplugged from his body.  Second, his left
hand had been placed onto his chest.  And third, something was
laid upon it.  Remembering the headache which had greeted him
when he had last woken up, he moved his head very carefully.
  His eyes slowly adjusted to the low ambient level of light. 
His hand had in fact been placed on his chest and the
perpetrator of that action could now be identified - sitting
on a chair at his side was Ricky.  She had gathered his left
hand in both of hers and was now sleeping with it under her
left cheek, head resting on his chest.
  Hausthar smiled lightly and raised his right hand to her
head, feeling the silky smoothness of her hair, running his
fingers through them.  He thought back to that morning he had
found her asleep on his sofa and a warm feeling engulfed his
chest.  He continued to caress her hair for a while before
finally falling asleep with his hand still resting upon her
head.

                           CHAPTER 8

  How do you make the difference between a Mecha and a human? 
Both require fuel of some sort; both think and reason; both
can be hurt and both can die.  And if that wasn't enough, here
we were against a machine with goddamn <feelings>!  You can't
win against that you know.  Turing must be smiling in his
grave.
                                       R. & D. Lab Technician.

  And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times.
                                       Late 20th Century song.


  The metallic footsteps resounded heavily throughout the
garden.  A sixty feet tall shadow fell over the bushes as the
Mecha walked past them, deep in conversation with the human
accompanying it. 
  "I understand why you would want to keep my body for
observation Dr. Lang, but why can't I see it now?  Your
technicians say I have recovered completely from the
incident." 
  The man next to it harumphed and looked towards the sky,
never ceasing to walk down the path.  The sky was the dark
blue that only could be seen on a cloudless day.  Staring at
it was like staring through infinity itself.  And in that blue
sky hung a warm yellow sun, witness to so much destruction
upon the planet it shone over.  It took Dr. Lang a while to
get his ideas through the wall the beauty of this place had
established in his mind.
  "Please understand: although your 'body' has recuperated, we
are not sure what psychological factors remain from your
ordeal.  It is not everyday that we can talk to someone who
survived what you experienced.  It could well be that seeing
your body would upset your mental state.  We have no way of
knowing how you will react.  This is entirely new to us... so
we would prefer to be cautious about it." 
  The Mecha bowed its head in recognition of the inevitability
of Lang's words.  Both continued to walk down the path which
wound itself around the gardens in the institute, watching
nature unfold itself amongst the bushes that were hiding the
surprises the next turn of the path would offer.  They came to
a field of grass interspersed with wild flowers.  This garden
was the pride of the Institute in a world where most of nature
had been destroyed in the Zentraedi Rain of Fire which had
annihilated most of the wildlife, both plants and animals.
  Lang sat on a bench situated in the middle of the green and
gold field, and beckoned the Mecha to lower itself beside him. 
<It is hard to think of the cruel world which lurks behind the
walls of this garden when one is surrounded by such beauty>,
thought Lang.  <Why must the human race, ANY race, have such a
penchant for war?>
  "How goes your training Michele?" he suddenly asked, shaking
the feeling which was overcoming him, a feeling he hadn't felt
for so long... <ever since that first trip amongst the remain
of the crashed SDF-1>, he reflected.
  "Very well Doctor, I am quickly learning to adapt to this
new situation..."  The Mecha paused a few seconds.  "Aren't
these birds lovely?  I do so love their songs..."  Two
compartments opened on each side of the Mecha's thorax,
revealing sensitive loudspeakers.  Both instruments hummed for
a moment, then burst into life with a re-creation of the
bird's song, perfect down to the last note.  The speakers
repeated the call as the nearby birds flew down to find the
source of this song, finally perching themselves on the
shoulders of the machine and joining it in its joyous
exclamation of music.
  The Mecha lowered its right hand and extended a waldo from
its forearm, reaching down with it to pick a flower.  Another
waldo quickly followed it and soon the Mecha was holding a
bouquet, offering it to the birds who quickly rummaged through
it, searching for bugs within the yellow petals and green
leaves of the plants.
  "Sometimes, if I concentrate enough, I can feel the feedback
from the things I pick up.  I can actually feel the fragility
of the plants I just picked.  Maybe this isn't so bad... but
still, I will feel better when I'll have rejoined my body."
  "I thought we weren't going to talk about that anymore
Michele." remarked Lang.
  "I'm sorry Doctor, it just slipped out.  It's just that I
feel something has happened to my body, something... Oh well,
I suppose you're right. 'Better off not talking about it.  I'm
not really in such a hurry to see it.  After all, it's not as
if it's about to get up and walk out on me, is it?"

  Michele was fuming.  Ever since she had gotten out of the
hospital, all she had been faced with was paperwork.  Signing
release forms at the hospital, signing in at the base, proving
to the commanding officer that she was fit for duty (more
paperwork), getting allocated a room, a new Mecha...
paperwork, paperwork, <paperwork>.  All these pieces of paper
were dancing around her mind in such a disorderly fashion that
she couldn't remember the contents of the last form she had
signed.  If someone had presented her a contract, she would
probably have bought five hectares in the Wastelands without
realising it.  Luckily, Michael was helping her.
  Picking up both her bags Michael winked at Michele, grabbed
a pamphlet with the base's map and timetable, prodded her up
the stairs to the second floor and guided her to a room near
the end of the corridor, in the north wing of the building. 
He dropped the bags and gave her one of his infuriating grins.
  "Would you believe that the Private in charge of room
allocation gave you the room next to mine by mistake?"  He
didn't wait for her to answer but fished out a key from his
pocket and started to open the door.  "Wouldn't it be
surprising if it had... Why yes, there it is... A common door. 
Now isn't <that> a coincidence!"
  Michele grabbed the bags and smiled at him as she closed the
door behind her.  "If there is one thing I have learned it's
that nothing happens around you by coincidence.  I suppose it
is coincidence that you took sick just long enough to be able
to get a room next to mine in the hospital?  Or that virtually
every flowershops' bouquets found their way into my room by
accident?  Or that..."
  "All right, I'll confess, I'm guilty of all charges."  He
smiled at her and went to open the window drapes.  The view
from the window gave onto a panoramic display of the SDF-1 and
SDF-2 resting back-to-back in the middle of Lake Gloval.  The
sun, already starting to set, was perfectly centered between
the gigantic 'tuning forks' which were the fortresses' Main
Guns.  He stared awhile at the sight of the red-orange globe
as it descended behind the megalithic figures in the lake. 
Just as it disappeared beyond the horizon, Michael heard a
rustle of clothes behind him and turned around.  Michele was
finishing taking off her uniform in the middle of the room.
  "Ah... Er... I think I'd better leave... "
  Michele looked at him with a languorous smile.  "I was
hoping you could spend the night here" she softly said.
  "Yes, well, I seem to have left my pajamas in my room..."
blurted Michael.
  Michele's lips met his as she grabbed him around the waist
with one hand and started to undo his buttons with the other. 
"I was hoping you would say that." she whispered.
  There was a light ruffle as the last of her clothes slowly
fell to the ground.

  His whole body was still slightly sore from the endless days
in the hospital bed, but at last he was free... <well, as free
as one can be in the Armed Forces anyway>.  Hausthar's heart
jumped with joy as he once again stood in front of the
Robotech Research and Development building.  He entered the
premises, waved at the secretary and promptly walked into the
'wall' leading to Lang's office.  He was just about to knock
on the door when voices within made him pause.
  "... But General Leonard..."
  "There are no 'but's, Lang!  This plane of yours is off the
project.  The council has finally seen it my way and has
ordered you to start testing and production of the new Hover
Tanks and AJACS.  You wouldn't go against council directives,
would you?"
  "Well no, I... "
  "I didn't think so!  This is Dr. Lazlo Zand.  He will be
your assistant in this project.  It seems he shares your
admiration for this <Protoculture> of yours."
  Hausthar recoiled at that name.  <Zand>.  It was the same
name he had heard days ago in one of the underground
laboratories.  He was the one who had ordered that green-
blond haired child to be hooked up to a Protoculture
Generator.
  "I hope you two will enjoy working together.  Goodbye Lang."
  Hausthar moved away from the door as it opened.  Two figures
walked out of Lang's office: a bald, fat man dressed in a
brown Southern Cross Army uniform and a short wizened person
whose facial features seemed to be hidden from Hausthar by a
constant mist around his face.  Both disappeared down the
corridor.
  Lang stood by the doorway, watching their shadows retreat in
the distance.  "Politicians!" he snorted.  Hausthar's presence
suddenly came to his attention.  He studied him for a moment
before speaking once again.  "Glad to see you are out of the
hospital.  I'm sorry if this seems a bit rude, but could you
come back some other time?"
  There again was the politeness Lang was such a miser with. 
<Why is he so polite with me?> thought Hausthar.  He
nonetheless stuttered a yes and watched as Lang retreated into
his office, the door closing noiselessly behind him.
  He had turned around and was about to make his way down the
corridor when a sudden feeling of warmth spread like a wave
from his lower abdomen across his chest.  With this feeling of
warmth came a shortness of breath which hit Hausthar with
surprise.  He wasn't feeling pain... in fact the feeling was
rather pleasant, as if he'd just had an... He shook his head
and tried to clear his mind from this line of thought.  His
breath slowly returned to him.

  Michele laid on her back in the rather large bed in her
room, her breathing slowly going back to normal.  She turned
to look at Michael who was lying beside her, watching her,
caressing her hips.  She slid on top of him and embraced him
with all the passion she could muster from her soul.

  The Mecha bay was a noisy place to be: work was always in
progress around the clock.  Servo-motors whined as damaged
Veritechs struggled to mechamorph under the watchful eyes of
the technicians.  Hausthar stopped and glanced around until he
had spotted the person he was looking for.  Getting closer, he
tapped him on the shoulder.
  "Hey, George!  You got a minute?"
  The overalls straightened out and revealed George's
features.  His face lit up as he recognised the person who had
called him.  "Hausthar!  Man, am I glad you're out of
hospital..."  He stopped and eyed his friend suspiciously. 
"You <were> discharged, right?"
  "Yep, all nice and official." replied Hausthar.  He glanced
at the Mecha George had been working on.
  "She's all repaired and ready to go.  Even painted her with
your colours: Light blue with light brown trimmings."
  Hausthar walked around the Alpha, his hand gliding along its
metal skin, his mind replaying the moment of the crash, trying
to file it away, trying to forget it.
  "When is she going up again?" enquired George.
  "There's been a slight change of plans."  admitted Hausthar.
  "Oh.  What happened?"
  "She's going to be moth-balled.  They think she's too
dangerous." Hausthar said.  He continued to eye the jet as he
walked around it, inspecting it.
  "<WHAT?>  That's outrageous!  She's about as safe as they
come." shouted George.
  "Shush... You know that and I know that... But they don't. 
Which is why you are going to find a nice, secluded hangar for
this baby and moth-ball an empty shell in its place.  I want
to be able to finish testing her without their knowing it. 
Can it be done?"
  George's face was grinning happily at him.  "Does the sun
rise every morning?  It'd be criminal to put this plane on the
shelf.  Hangar D is empty, and I'll fiddle the paperwork so it
remains that way.  Even smuggle a few spare parts and
equipment in there for the check-up."
  "What about ammunition for the live-ammo testing?"
  "Are you kidding?  I sometimes tell myself that the only
reason Zentraedi aren't able to walk out with all the ammo
they want is because they are not allowed <in> in the first
place.  Apart from that, they'd never be caught.  You worry
about making sure nobody realises you're flying a plane that's
supposed to be moth-balled, I'll take care of the rest."
  "Thanks for the help."  A clock on the wall gave out a short
buzz, causing Hausthar to automatically look at his watch.  "7
O'Clock!" he exclaimed.  "Jeezus!  <Ricky!>  I forgot about
dinner!  Listen George, I gotta go, fast.  I'll see you
tomorrow."  He scrambled for the door without waiting for an
answer, leaving a surprised George behind him, scratching his
head.
  "Well, well, well." George muttered to himself.  "She must
be one hell of a girl for <him> to be in such a state."

  In a hangar especially designed for it, a Battloid was
having a hard time falling asleep.  It shifted restlessly on
its specially designed bed.  It didn't really need a bed to
sleep, it could have slept on the floor, but the
psychoanalysts had decided it would be better for its mental
health to have as many 'normal' things around it as possible. 
And it had worked; just the act of lying on a sixty feet bed
usually sent the Mecha into something akin to human sleep. 
But this time it was not working right.
  The Battloid tossed and turned on its bunk, trying to catch
that elusive sleep.  Brief bursts of memories flashed through
its mind in its half-asleep state.  Missiles pursued it
through a landscape even Picasso would have had a hard time
understanding.  Energy crackled through its imaginary body as
the missiles surrounded it, blocking off all escape routes. 
It had prepared itself for the worst when a face appeared in
front of it, fending off the missiles, offering a shield to
their blasts.  And with the face came a name from deep within
its memory.  <Michael>, it thought.  <I must find Michael.>
  It struggled against consciousness a while longer before
finally surrendering to the black abyss of a restless sleep.

  Ricky had been waiting at the restaurant for a little over
half-an-hour when Hausthar finally arrived.  It was a small,
friendly establishment located on the fourth floor of an old-
style building near the centre of Tokyo.
  Hausthar grabbed the seat opposite hers and slumped into it. 
"I'm sorry I'm late" he apologised "but I had some business to
take care of at the base."
  "It's all right." replied Ricky, placing her hand gently on
top of his.  Hausthar's heart skipped a beat.  "I'm just glad
you're here."  Her eyelids lowered slightly, accentuating her
schoolgirl look.
  "So am I."  He stared at her for a while, time forgotten,
until someone cleared their throat next to him.  He looked up
to see what looked like a waiter waiting to take their orders. 
The newcomer confirmed his suspicions.
  "May I take your orders?"  he uttered in perfect waiter
fashion, flipping open a small book.
  "What do you recommend?" asked Ricky.
  "The lasagna is particularly delicious tonight, miss."
answered the waiter, removing the top from his pen.
  "We'll have two lasagnas with a bottle of red wine." said
Hausthar.
  "Very well sir." replied the waiter and walked off towards
the kitchen, taking two more orders on the way.  He had barely
made it to the swinging doors when an explosion sent him to
the floor.
  Hausthar looked up just in time to see a ball of fire engulf
the tables closest to the kitchen door, instantly incinerating
those seated around them.  A secondary explosion resounded
outside the restaurant's front door, remnants of another
fireball burning through it.  Hausthar searched for Ricky and
found her sprawled on the floor.  He stood up to help her to
her feet.  A flaming support beam speared through the chair he
had been seated in a fraction of a second earlier.  More
pieces of the ceiling rained about him as he heard the
frightened screams of patrons running for the fire exits.  He
picked up Ricky's inert body before realising that the fallen
beam had blocked his only escape route - he was surrounded by
fire.  Frantically he searched for an opening in the wall of
flames.  He caught sight of a window behind the waving
curtains of fire.  He struggled to get a better glimpse of it;
something snapped in his mind.  He felt a gust of wind
originate from it and blow in a straight line between him and
the window, extinguishing the flames.
  Ricky's voice came to him through his stupor.  "<RUN!>"  He
reacted automatically, racing for the window.  Another
explosion resounded behind him, sending Hausthar and Ricky
flying through the window, falling to the ground.  In his
state of panic it took Hausthar several seconds to realise he
had yet to hit the pavement, and that in fact the speed of his
fall had dramatically reduced.  He hit the pavement with a
heavy thud and immediately tried to get back on his feet. 
"What the... ?"
  A hand grabbed his wrist and pulled him up from the
sidewalk, urging him along the street towards a cab waiting at
the corner.  "What happened?  <What happened?>" repeated
Hausthar, staring at Ricky's face.
  "I can't tell you." she answered, tears streaming down her
face. "I can't tell you.  Let's just go home."  She hailed the
cab and waited for it to arrive.

                           CHAPTER 9

Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?
                                       Late 20th Century song.


  The taxi pulled in front of Research's main gates and let
two figures out before departing again.  The two figures
passed by the guards without being challenged and made their
way towards a building in the compound.  Neither talked until
they had reached Hausthar's room and closed the door behind
them.
  "What was all that about?" demanded Hausthar, making an
obvious effort to keep his voice down.  "By all rights, I
shouldn't be alive.  I shouldn't have been able to make my way
through the flames and I certainly should not have survived
that fall.  <So what the Hell is going on?>"
  Ricky was sitting on the couch, looking at her feet, not
daring to raise her head.  Hausthar threw his hands up in
desperation and switched on the television in time to catch a
news bulletin about the disaster.
  " ...ill no idea on how the fire started, but firemen have
ruled out malicious intent.  So far no survivors have been
found as the blaze still rages here in down-town Tokyo, but
witnesses say they saw two figures thrown from the
restaurant's fourth-story window as they tried to escape the
flames.  No bodies have been found outside the restaurant so
police are dismissing this account..." 
  Hausthar turned off the sound and faced Ricky, forcing her
to look at him.  Tears were still streaming from her eyes as
he asked her once more, desperation in his voice.  "What
happened Ricky?"
  "It happened too soon." she answered through her sobs.  "You
weren't supposed to awake until I was finished with you."
  Hausthar's thoughts were stopped by the shock her words
produced in him.  "What do you mean 'until you were finished
with me'?" he asked, sitting down in a chair opposite the
couch.  "What were you supposed to do to me?"
  Ricky fought down the sobs as she answered his question.  "I
was sent to train you, to help you along the way, to try to
make you understand what was about to happen to you.  But this
accident triggered off your powers before I had a chance to
explain them to you."
  "My powers?"  Hausthar said queasily.  "I don't have any
powers."
  "Yes you do." she replied.  "Thanks to your genetic make-
up, you have been granted the power of control over certain
energies.  I was sent to try and teach you how to use them
without harm, and I have failed."
  Hausthar's mind was becoming quite numb by the minute. 
"What genetic make-up?  I don't even know my parents."
  "That's because you don't have any.  You're a clone,
Hausthar!  Part of Earth's first experiment at generating
life.  Your mother was an artificial womb and your father was
an undifferentiated cell on which your scientists
experimented.  You are part of Earth's first Clonal
Triumvirate!  That's why you have the Power."
  Hausthar slumped into the chair.  "A... a clone?  Bu.. But
that's impossible, I have memories.  I'm a human being, with
feelings, and emotions!"
  "You were 'born' a little over a year ago" insisted Ricky
"in a laboratory in this research facility.  These memories
you have were impressed upon you as part of your in-vitro
training.  The only real memories you have are those of the
past year."
  By now Hausthar was gazing blankly past her shoulder,
through the glass door into the night.  "You said I was one of
three.  Who are the others?"
  "I... I'm not allowed to say." admitted Ricky.
  "What about the cell donor?  Whose cell was it?"
  Ricky paused a moment before answering softly.  "Lang... It
was Dr. Lang's cells they used for the genetic manipulation." 
Hausthar continued to gaze through the window, showing no
signs of life.  "I'm sorry Hausthar.  You weren't supposed to
learn about all this until I'd finished training you and..."
  "Who sent you?" he interrupted.
  "I... I can't... " stammered Ricky.
  Hausthar insisted. "Who sent you?"
  She lowered her head to avoid his gaze as she replied "You
met him when you had your accident a few days ago."
  Hausthar emitted a low growl as anger flooded into him.  He
got up and briskly walked back and forth along the length of
the room, finally stopping to smash his fist against a door-
jamb.  "A pawn!" he roared.  "I am meant to be a pawn!"  His
fists repeatedly smashed against the wall.  "To answer to
someone's whims and fight for him in his power-play?  I am no
servant!  I am not a clone!  I am a human being!" he exclaimed
as he threw open the door and disappeared down the corridor.
  Ricky jumped from the couch and ran after him, shouting his
name.  She caught sight of him as he rounded a corner but by
the time she herself reached it, he had vanished from the
corridor.  She called out his name several times, not caring
about the building's other inhabitants, but to no avail - the
only reply she heard was the sound of her heart.  Collapsing
against a wall, she slid down to the floor.  "I love you!" she
murmured as she buried her head in her hands and wept.

  Hausthar stopped running once he had left the building and
lost himself in the labyrinth that was Research.  He walked,
not caring where, until he found a bench hidden by a grove. 
Dejectedly, he sat on the bench and threw his head back,
staring at the stars and the moon.  His eyes caught on to the
bright body that orbited the Earth just slightly under the
moon.  This was 'Little Luna', a Robotech Factory captured by
the R.D.F. a couple of days ago in a daring raid against the
remaining Zentraedi forces in this quadrant.  Hausthar gazed
at it for a long time before speaking.
  "You and me both, Little Luna.  It seems we are both to be
abducted by people we know not, to be used in a fight we care
nothing about.  We are both pawns in this game, <toys of
destruction!>"

  Michael stood in front of the Colonel's door, waiting to be
let in.  He was wondering why he had been called so early in
the morning - what was so important that it had to be done at
3 O'Clock in the morning?
  The door finally opened, allowing him to enter.  Inside the
office was the Colonel, his aide and a third person who needed
no introduction to Michael.  "Dr. Lang!  Sir!  What are you
doing here?  Has something happened to Hausthar?"  he
exclaimed.  The Colonel harumphed his disapproval.  "Oh.  I'm
sorry sir."  Michael saluted and came to attention.
  The Colonel's aide turned towards him and explained. 
"Nothing has happened to your friend, Corporal.  Dr. Lang here
has asked for you specifically."  Lang rose from his seat and
turned just in time to see Michael try and stifle a yawn. 
"I'm sorry sir," apologised Michael "but I've had a rather,
er... busy night."
  Lang gave a small smile.  "It is me who should apologise.  I
keep on forgetting there is a 17 hour difference between here
and Japan.  But in fact it is because of your, as you said,
busy night that I am here to see you.  I need your help,
Corporal."
  Michael looked at him questioningly.  "How may I be of
assistance to you Dr. Lang?"
  "We've had a rather bad case of shell-shock in Tokyo lately. 
No, no, it's not your friend Reneth.  What we need is someone
to talk to our patient, to humour it, er... her.  It seems she
will not be quiet until she's seen you."
  "Excuse me sir, but let me try to get this straight.  You
got me up at three in the morning to talk to a shell-shock
patient?"
  "A very special patient as you will see." replied Lang.
  Michael gave out a small sigh.  "Very well sir.  I'll do
it."
  Lang turned towards the Colonel.  "Do you mind if I borrow
him for a while?  I'll return him as soon as I've finished."

  The hangar was guarded by four M.P.s in full gear.  Lang
showed them his identification and they immediately began to
open the heavily-barred door.
  "Let me try to soften the shock a bit.  This is not your
average patient we have in there." started Lang.
  "Why?" joked Michael.  "Hospital beds too small?"
  "You could say that.  Remember though, no matter what you
see or hear, I want you to humour that patient.  We do not yet
know what might happen if she goes crazy, but given her
condition, it would not be pretty."  The guards opened the
door and saluted.  "Well then, if you do not have any other
questions, I suggest we go in."
  The inside of the hangar was dimly lit, leaving only small
areas lit by yellow globes.  In the far corner, Michael could
see a big shadow against the wall, surround by slightly
smaller ones.  From the vicinity of the shadow, a voice
emanated.
  "Michael, is that you?"
  "Michele?" queried Michael, looking around for her.  "What
are you doing here?"
  "They were kind enough to bring me here from Japan to see
you." replied the voice.
  "From Jap...?" started Michael.
  Lang interrupted him and turned towards one of the guards. 
"I think you'd better hit the lights."  The guard moved
towards the nearest wall and fumbled a bit in the dark. 
Bright lights came on, illuminating a gigantic chair in which
was seated a Battloid.  Michael strained to find Michele, but
could not see her.  The Battloid stood up and walked towards
him, extending a waldo.
  "Michael," said Michele's voice, coming from the Battloid 
"It's so nice to see you again."
  Michael shook the waldo, a little dumfounded.  He glanced at
the Battloid, trying to understand why it looked so familiar. 
Recognition finally came and his mouth opened in consternation
as understanding set in.

  The apartment was in complete darkness as Hausthar walked
in.  He briefly glanced around but found no signs of Ricky. 
Moaning softly he sat down on the couch and tried to
understand how he was feeling.  He felt betrayed, hurt, but
above all he felt a sense of loss, as if a part of him was
missing in some way.  Surely this could not be attributed to
Ricky's disappearance?  After all, he had only known her for
less than a month!
  He kicked his shoes off and laid on the seat, hands behind
his head, trying not to think about the cold hand that was
gripping his heart.  He lounged there for several minutes,
staring at the darkened ceiling, until a restless sleep
finally took him.

  " ...in a big hangar like this one, only it had more
furniture.  I've been cooped in there for over two weeks.  So
yesterday morning I told them that if they didn't let me see
you soon, I would go on strike and not participate in any more
of their tests." droned the Veritech.  It suddenly realised it
had been speaking for the last thirty minutes without letting
her listener place a word in.  "Oh!  I'm sorry Michael.  It's
just that it's been so long since I've talked to somebody I
knew before this accident happened."
  Michael smiled a feeble smile.  "It's all right Michele, I
understand perfectly.  I guess I'd feel that way too if I'd
been prodded and pushed by strangers for so long."
  "It wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact
that they wouldn't let me see my body in the hospital."  A
thought crossed the Battloid's mind.  "Say, you wouldn't have
seen it, would you?  After all, you are my wing-man."
  "Well... I guess... Yes, I have..." stammered Michael.
  "How is it doing?  Is it all right?  No permanent damage I
hope?" it asked anxiously.
  "No."  Michael answered.  "It's doing fine.  It's in great
shape.  Best I've ever seen."
  The Battloid seemed happy about this news.  "Good.  I guess
I don't have anything to worry about then."  It was about to
continue with the conversation when Lang came up to them and
intervened.
  "I am sorry to interrupt, but it is getting rather late. 
I'm afraid Corporal Circle has to go back to his duties."
  "Oh." said the Mecha dejectedly.  "I s'pose you have to
then."  A trace of sadness was evident in its voice.  "Will I
be able to see you again?"
  "Sure," answered Michael "any time you want."
  Lang walked up to the Battloid and looked it in the eye. 
"You need some rest too, Michele.  Why don't you try to sleep
a bit while I walk the Corporal back to the office?"
  "Very well Dr. Lang." replied the Veritech as it once again
returned to its gigantic chair.
  "Doctor Lang," asked Michael as it left them "why is it
carrying a GU-11?"  In fact, the Battloid was not only armed
with its GU-11, but Michael had noticed it also had a full
complement of heat-seeking missiles on its wing pylons.
  Lang cleared his throat before answering.  "It complained
that it felt naked without them.  It started to go hysterical
on us after a couple of hours, so we armed it with a full
weapons complement.  It's been quiet ever since."  Lang gently
grabbed Michael's arm and started towards the exit, pulling
him along.  "I'm afraid I have some other news for you, but
you may not like it."
  Michael stepped through the door into the cold night air of
the outside and turned towards him.  "What now?"
  "Well... " started Lang "we ran some psychological tests on
her."  He pointed towards the hangar with his thumb.
  "And?"
  "And it seems it's in love with you." Lang let out abruptly.
  "<WHAT?>" shouted Michael.  "You can't be serious.  I have
enough trouble keeping up with the <human> Michele, but a
sixty feet tall can of sardine..?  I'd never survive the
relationship!"
  "We totally agree with you, but it thinks of itself as
human.  So do many of our experts.  They've even started to
refer to it as 'her'.  What we need... "  Lang never got to
finish his sentence - a dark shadow was approaching from the
base, calling out to them.
  "Michael.  I was told I'd find you here.  Why'd you leave in
the middle of the night?"
  "<MICHELE?!>" cried Michael.  "What are you doing here? 
Didn't they tell you to..."  He never finished either.  A loud
screech came from the hangar as its door was forced open from
the inside.  The tall figure of the Battloid stepped through
the opening and rightened itself before speaking.
  "Did you call me Mi..." it started to say when it caught
sight of Michele.  It stiffened as its sensors registered the
identity of this newcomer.  "Who... Who are you?" it demanded.
  Michele was struck dumb by the question.  "Corporal Michele
Cequor.  Who are you?"  she responded.
  The Mecha took a step forward, emitting bizarre sounds. 
"This cannot be.  You cannot be me.  I am Michele Cequor." 
The Veritech's computer fought against the data its sensors
were sending it.  swaying slightly, it took a few more steps
towards the base's runway, its voice garbled by electronic
noises.  It finally turned towards the group of humans and re-
iterated its plea.  "You cannot be real.  You must be an
imposter." it wailed.
  "I am Corporal Michele Cequor, service number 879-554871,
attached to Skull Squadron under the orders of Lieutenant
Richard Hunter."  replied Michele in a daze.
  A warning came from one of the guards as it spied movement
coming from the Mecha.  "HIT THE DECK!" came the shout as all
responded to the cry.
  The Battloid's wings swung apart, showing four pylons
covered with missiles.  It held its head in its hand as it
shook it, trying to resolve the conflict that raged within. 
Finally, it fell to its knees, arms akimbo, shouting to the
sky.  "<NOOO!>"
  Red light flooded the area as twelve streaks of smoke rose
from the wings into the night sky.
  The missiles flew up for five hundred meters, then turned
around and returned whence they came.  The explosion deafened
those present as the twelve carriers of death impacted with
the Battloid, reducing it to dust, sending shrapnel hundreds
of meters away.
  As the witnesses stood up and brushed the dust from their
faces, there were some who swore they had heard a sound still
hanging on the wind after the roar...
  The sound of someone weeping.

                          CHAPTER 10

Through good times,
And bad times,
I'll be on your side forever more
'Cause that's what friends are for.
                                       Late 20th Century song.

  We are the Night Music - Search, Attack, Destroy.  We are
not under your command.  We bring the war to the enemy.
            R. Sopwith, commander of the Night Music Squadron.


  Lang's reaction to the destruction of the Battloid had been
a mixed one.  Search teams combed the runway all day, picking
up the pieces of a mecha which had committed suicide.  By
nightfall, Lang and his team were on their way back to Japan,
carrying with them a handbag's worth of electronic components
that had been salvaged from the wreckage.  Needless to say
that two pilots got the talk-down of their life.
  "Shee-<eet>!" exclaimed Michael as he closed the office door
behind him.  "You'd think the Colonel was holding us
personally responsible for this incident."
  Michele leaned against the wall, hands behind her head. 
"Well... we were... sort of."  She still couldn't understand
the sudden impulse which had made her search for him in the
middle of the night, precipitating the Battloid's suicide. 
"So what do we do now?" she asked, eyes half closed as she
looked at him.
  "I do believe we have some unfinished business to take care
of." replied Michael, nodding his head towards their quarters.
  Michele giggled.  "You cad!" she murmured as she took hold
of his hand and urged him towards the door.

  Waking up to an empty apartment was not really a harrowing
experience, but remembering why it was empty nearly had
Hausthar decide to call in sick and spend the rest of the day
in bed, feeling sorry for himself.  The final decision was
made for him as his quarter's door opened to let someone
through.
  "Good morning Corporal." said a metallic voice.  Hausthar
looked up and saw one of Lang's waiter-droids standing next to
his bed.  "The doctor regrets that he is not here to give you
your assignment in person" continued the droid "but he had
urgent business in the States.  The doctor should be back
later today.  Until then, you are required to remain in
contact with Research.  That is all."  The droid opened a
small compartment in its cylindrical body and an electronic
pager landed on the bedside table.  The droid bowed slightly
and departed, closing the door behind it.
  Hausthar picked up the pager and looked at it.  <So>, he
thought, <I'm given the day off.>  He got up and walked over
to the phone, pager in hand, and dialed a number from memory.
  "George?  Hausthar.  Have you completed our little
transaction?... Good.  Listen, I'll be along in half an hour. 
Do you think you can get her ready by then?... Yes, with full
load.  I want to take her up for a test run... Thanks."  He
returned the handle to its cradle and went back into the
bedroom to change.

  Hangar D was a structure of metal built at the furthest end
of the base.  Looking at it, no-one would suspect that it was
in use - rust flaked from its walls, abandoned oil-drums
littered around it.  Inside, however, was the latest in
Robotechnology - a newly repaired prototype Alpha Fighter. 
Hausthar walked around it, visually checking it out whilst
George ran the electronics through their paces.
  Probe in hand, George was checking the response in the
Alpha's right support thruster.  "Hey, Haust!  How're you
gonna get this baby off the ground without the controllers
getting suspicious?  This plane ain't exactly inconspicuous."
  Hausthar emerged from the underside, where he had been
checking the intakes.  "I've got a friend working there.  He
told me what to say to get clearance.  My only trouble will be
to get up in the air as fast as possible before someone
decides to check me out visually."
  "Guess you know what you're doing."  George's head
disappeared inside the cockpit only to reappear a second
later.  "Are you sure you want this gadget in here?  It ain't
exactly regulations you know."  His hand was holding a
cassette-player for Hausthar's inspection.
  "Yeah, I do.  It's been done before, hasn't it?"
  "Are you kidding?  There was only one other in the R.D.F.
with a cassette-player hooked to his internal systemry... and
he never came back from the attack on Dolza's command ship."
  "Well I don't intend on going MIA like Commander Sopwith, if
that's what you mean."
  George sighed and started opening the jet's console panels. 
"What's the big idea anyway?  You get bored listening to the
tac-net or somethin'?"
  "Sopwith was the R.D.F.'s greatest ace.  This is my way of
remembering the anniversary of his disappearance.  So get on
with it will you?"
  "All right, all right.  Getting on with it." grumbled
George.  Sounds of an electronic drill came from the cockpit
and filled the air in the hangar's closed environment.

  Michael and Michele were duking it out, exchanging cannon
fire, missiles tearing up the skies as they sought to reach
their targets.  Michele's grey Veritech went Battloid and
tried to get a bead on Michael's light-green Guardian as it
went into a spin, trying to evade one of the mavericks she had
launched at him.  Michael's Guardian suddenly changed
direction by ninety degrees upward just as the missile was
going to reach it.  The maverick didn't have time to follow
and flashed past the Mecha as Michael brought his GU-11 to
bear on it, emptying most of his clip into it before it
finally ruptured.
  Without letting a moment slip by, Michael went ballistic to
evade the cannon-fire Michele was directing his way and
mechamorphed to Battloid.  Letting go two AMRAAMs, he followed
them in, using their smoke-trail and radar paint to hide. 
Michele destroyed both missiles but could not react fast
enough to dodge out of Michael's way - the two Battloids met
in mid-air, metallic collision sounds echoing through the
battle-field.  Falling from the sky, the two mecha wrestled,
Michael getting the upper hand just as they crashed onto the
ground.  Before Michele could react Michael attacked with
devastating results, his Battloid's foot smashing her mecha's
right leg to pieces.  Warning sirens resounded as the Battloid
went down on one knee.  Michael moved in for the kill, GU-11
aimed at pilot's cockpit.  The smug look on his face
disappeared as he registered a quick movement from the downed
Veritech.  The last thing he saw were five Sidewinders
screaming towards him before the world went black.
  Victory sounds emerged from the <Battloid Attack!> machine
as the 3D screen disappeared from between the two players.  A
stylised Rick Hunter jumped out from the cockpit of a grey
Veritech and received a kiss from a very recognizable
representation of singing star Lynn Minmei.  Michael grunted
in disgust as his score showed him ranked as 20th on the best
50 players list.  "Care to go it a second round?" smirked
Michele, entering her name in the top place on the list.
  Michael was saved the embarrassment as a well-known voice
resounded near them.  "Congratulations on a good game, both of
you."  Michael looked up to see the Sterlings leaning against
the wall next to the machine.  Both pilots stood up and
saluted their commanding officers.
  "Thank you Sir." said Michael.  "May I ask how long you have
been watching?"
  "Long enough to see some interesting moves." replied Miriya
Sterling.  "It's the first time I've seen anyone use their
missiles as a smoke and radar screen."
  "Thank you Ma'am.  But surely you must have done better."
  "I don't know.  My first game against Max is not one I'm
likely to forget.  He literally thrashed me."
  Maximillian Sterling was starting to blush.  "Miriya, I
don't think they want to hear about this."
  "Oh, yes we do." blurted Michele.  "Please tell us more
about this, Commander."
  "Well," started Miriya "it's a long story and we are awaited
somewhere else..."  She paused, thinking.  "Why don't you come
with us, then I'll be able to tell you about it on the way."
  "But we wouldn't want to intrude..." stammered Michael.
  "Nonsense!" interrupted Max.  "I'm sure you'll be welcomed,
so let's not hear another word about it."  He hesitated for a
moment.  "Anybody knows where we might get a taxi around
here?"

  "This is Alpha X-ray 250, requesting clearance."
  "Tower to Alpha X-ray 250.  I'm sorry, but we don't seem to
have any flight plans from you."
  Hausthar breathed in deeply before answering.  "Affirmative
Tower.  I have override clearance.  Clearance code Delta
Foxtrot 5."
  The voice from the tower paused a few seconds, making
Hausthar sweat.  Finally, the confirmation was given.  "Tower
to Alpha X-ray 250, Research and Development clearance code
confirmed.  You are cleared for take-off on runway 36."
  Hausthar nudged the throttle along its tracks, taxied to the
runway and finally pushed the throttle to the maximum.  The
Alpha screamed down the length of the runway, attaining take-
off speed within a few seconds.  Hausthar pulled on the stick
and the jet aimed for the sky, leaving the confines of gravity
behind.  Switching to navigation radar Hausthar plotted a
course out of Tokyo, towards the Washingtonian Wastelands.
  Changing frequencies on his radio, Hausthar selected a
secured band and contacted George.  "George?  I've taken off
without any worries.  How's it going back there?"
  The radio crackled a few times before the answer came
through.  "It's going fine.  Nobody realised what plane you
were flying.  Are you still gonna go through with it?"
  "I guess it's the only way to show these idiots that this
plane is flyable.  I don't think they'll have much against it
if it manages to fly around the world without a hitch.  I
should reach the coast within the next half hour if my speed
holds up."
  "Where do you plan on going next?"
  "After I reach the coast I'll use New Macross' beacon to aim
for New Detroit, then on to York, New London, Delhi, and I
should be back home before the evening meal."
  "Got it.  See you then.  Out."
  "Out."  Hausthar turned the radio off and concentrated on
his flying.  Soon, he reached the limit of the ocean and
reached to place a tape in the cassete-deck.  The haunting
sounds of <Ride of the Valkyrie> filled the cockpit.  In front
of him, the sun was reaching for the sky on its never-ending
cycle of night and day.

  The house was located on the outskirts of New Macross, away
from the hustle and bustle of the city.  A knock on the door
by Max Sterling and the door opened, revealing an attractive
young lady of about his age with short blonde hair.  "Max,
Miriya!  Thanks for coming."  She noticed the group behind the
two.  "Who are your friends?"
  Max stepped aside, introducing his crew.  "These people are
Corporals Michele Cequor and Michael Circle."  He turned
towards them.  "I'd like to introduce a very good friend of
mine, First Lieutenant Jennifer Colquhoun.  She went through
training with me and Ben."
  Lieutenant Colquhoun moved to the side, letting them enter. 
Taking care of their jackets, she led them inside to join the
group of people waiting there and introduced them.  "This is
my brother, Charles..."
  A young man extended his hand towards them.  "Call me Chas."
he said, smiling broadly.
  "... and this is Sergeant Verndt."  The other person stood
up, a tall figure looking ill at ease in the company of the
new-comers, his light hair clashing with the bright brown of
his eyes.  "Verndt is a Zentraedi who defected at the same
time as the others.  He was assigned to the Night Music as a
Veritech Pilot."
  "I'm glad to meet you." said Verndt, extending his hand,
uncertain.  <I know how you feel>, thought Michele.  <A
stranger amongst strangers.>  She took his hand and shook it
warmly.
  "I'm glad to meet you too Verndt." she said sincerely with a
smile on her face.
  Jennifer Colquhoun reappeared from the next room with two
extra seats and offered them to Michael and Michele.  They
took the extended chairs and sat next to the Sterlings. 
Michele leaned towards Maximillian and asked softly "What are
we doing here?"
  Max turned towards her and answered "We are here to remember
lost friends and honour those of us who didn't make it through
the war.  It's a tradition in the Night Music."
  A warm fire sparkled and snapped in the fireplace.

  The Alpha was making its way towards New Macross, preparing
to sling-shot towards New Detroit when the fight erupted below
it.  Fireballs reached for the sky, forcing Hausthar to dodge
hard to starboard.  Looking downward he saw a small human
settlement under attack from two Zentraedi Pods and a
Zentraedi foot-soldier.  Checking his armaments, he
mechamorphed to Guardian and dove into the fire-storm.  The
first salvo of missiles erupted all around the Zentraedi foot-
soldier, ripping the flesh from his bones, instantly killing
him.  The second salvo totally missed its mark, exploding
harmlessly as the Battle Pod jumped clear.  The second Pod, an
Officer's, fired its particle cannon at the Alpha, puncturing
the armor, frying internals, severing power circuits.  Power
readings in the cockpit dropped by half as Hausthar drew a
bead on the Tactical Pod, obliterating it under a shower of
bullets from the Veritech's GU-XX.
  The Officer Pod wasted no time retaliating with a couple of
Armor-Piercing missiles, damaging the Veritech's power core,
reducing power even further.  Hausthar started to panic,
sensing Death moving in from the sidelines.  His alpha waves
jumped in and out of sync with the Veritech, causing it to
respond erratically to his commands.  In his mind, Hausthar
was screaming in anger and fear... and something snapped.
  He felt as if he was drinking alcohol, but not with a glass
or a bottle - It was as though the alcohol was being pumped
down his throat at high pressure, burning his throat, his
stomach, his entire body.  He screamed in pain but the flow of
hurt would not stop.

  Max Sterling stood up, facing the group and the fire-place,
holding his glass in his upraised hand.  "To those of us
facing the horrors of war daily."

  Hausthar screamed as energy crackled around his Guardian. 
The Veritech re-configured into Battloid, holding its
'stomach' in pain as luminescent snakes twirled around it.  On
the verge of blacking out, Hausthar shouted in pain, wishing
the hurt to go away.  The energies around the Veritech
coalesced into a ball and shot upwards into the atmosphere,
rapidly disappearing from sight.
  The Officer's Pod's pilot swore as the power was
mysteriously drained from his mecha.  Without pausing to
think, he popped the seals of his canopy, jumped out and
downed the enemy Battloid with a punch, surprised by the lack
of response from its pilot.  The Zentraedi took no notice of
the slowly-opening missile launchers as he pummeled the mecha
and ripped one of its hands off.

  Charles Colquhoun stood up next and raised his glass.  "To
those of us who didn't make it.  To Richard Stoner, Ben
Dixon... and all the others who died so we could be here to
remember them."

  Hausthar felt himself slip into unconsciousness.  All around
him, the only sights and sounds were those of a Zentraedi
Renegade destroying the Alpha with his bare fists.  In pain,
slowly, he tried to reach the HOTAS, hoping he was not too
late.

  Jennifer was the last to toast.  "To Ralph Sopwith."  The
empty glasses were thrown into the fireplace, all but hers. 
They flew a parabolic course, smashing against the brick wall,
the shards falling towards the fire that would erase all
traces of their existence.

  A rumble warned the Zentraedi that something was wrong.  He
had about half a second to ponder the subject before the
missiles hit him at point-blank range, penetrating his armor,
exploding inside his body, sending shrapnel over the
countryside.  The Veritech disappeared within the eruption of
flames that followed the thunder of the explosion.

  The power-ball still flew upwards in what seemed a random
fashion; three shadowy figures looked from their hiding place,
nudging it along the way.  The ball left the atmosphere and
flew straight towards the mecha factory that laid in orbit
around the world.  It connected and entered the power grid,
shorting circuitry.  All around the factory, warnings were
sent as machinery shut-down one by one.  Figures ran about,
putting out the fires and cutting power before new ones
erupted.
  A tall figure dressed in a blue coat and white captain's hat
looked at the mess in front of him.  He turned towards the
gnomish shadow next to him.  "How bad is it, Exedore?" he
asked.
  The Zentraedi paused before answering.  "I'm afraid it may
be much worse than first thought, Admiral Gloval.  We might be
down permanently." he answered.
  "I see." growled the visitor.  Both were aware that no-one
present could repair the alien automated systemry that had
fried.  The factory was now no more than an orbiting scrap-
yard.

                          CHAPTER 11

Midnight Blues -
So lonely without you.
                                       Late 20th Century song.

Whoever said "'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to
have loved at all" was a complete <jerk>.
                          Remark attributed to Michele Cequor.


  "... Disobeying orders as you did is inexcusable!  That
plane was supposed to be moth-balled, like its partner, but
thanks to you it is now a piece of junk."  Doctor Lang was
pacing the length and breadth of the office as he was
bellowing at Hausthar.  "It's a miracle you came out of there
alive.  By all rights you should be dead."
  "Yes..." smirked Hausthar, his voice full of sarcasm "I seem
to have a knack for avoiding death lately."
  "Your actions were inexcusable, irresponsible and
unforgivable.  You acted with the responsibility of..."
  "Of a fourteen month-old clone?" interrupted Hausthar.
  Lang stopped dead in his tracks and looked him in the eyes. 
"What did you say?" he enquired.
  "I said 'a fourteen month-old clone'.  Isn't that what I am,
Doctor?"  Hausthar stood up from his seat and moved towards
Lang.
  "How... when did you learn of this?" asked Lang.
  "About two days ago.  It now makes perfect sense: lost
family, found wandering in from the Wastelands, no memories,
no friends that go back more than a year.  The perfect set-
up!"  Hausthar was gritting his teeth in an effort to stop the
anger from flowing out.  "What I want to know, Doctor, is
<why>?  Why did you do this?  What reasons can you have for
toying with someone's life as if you were God?"
  Lang sat down heavily at his desk.  "I suppose 'how' doesn't
really matter anymore, now that you do know.  It was to be our
greatest achievement, the creation of lives exactly like ours,
human in every respect.  So we created you.  You were grown
in-vitro for a couple of months, then brought to the real
world.  We took great pain to make sure no-one would know who
you really were: we implanted false memories into your mind,
we made sure your past history was untraceable, your Academy
records were forged to make it look as though you had
transferred in half-way through the course.  It was all worked
out perfectly."  Lang slumped in his seat.
  "But why, Doctor?" insisted Hausthar.  "<Why?>"
  Lang looked him in the eye.  "Look at me Hausthar.  Take a
good look.  People talk of me as the new Einstein, as somebody
who is not to be understood.  Respected, feared perhaps, but
not liked.  I, too, consider myself human.  Do you know how
hard it is to relate to someone when all they can think of is
the fact that your eyes do not have irises, that you are not
like them.  But I am.  You asked me why I did what I did... I
wanted to know what it was like to be a father.  Is that so
hard to understand?"
  "You did not have the right to make me a freak!" howled
Hausthar.
  "Is that how you consider yourself?" countered Lang. 
"Biologically created or genetically engineered, what is the
difference if the end products cannot be differentiated?  You
are as human as I am, as human as the next."
  A cynical laugh came from Hausthar.  "Not quite, Doctor.  I
have learned a lot since."  His face fell.  "Who are the
others, Doctor Lang... <Father>."  He spoke the last word with
as much cynicism as he could muster.
  "I am not allowed to..." started Lang, when he stopped
short.  All over the office, the lights were fading, turning
off one by one.  The only source of radiance was centered
around Hausthar - whips of light snaked around him, alive in
their power, ominous in their presence.
  "Tell me!" Hausthar insisted, oblivious to the light's
presence.
  <My God!  When did he ever...>  Lang studied the effect
surrounding Hausthar as he answered.  "The first is named
Michele Cequor.  She's assigned to the Skull Squadron."
  "What about the second?"
  "... It's Victor." admitted Lang.
  The words hit Hausthar with enough force to render him numb. 
The luminescent effect around him faded and died as the light
came back on.  "Victor?" he repeated.
  "Yes.  He was the first we tried to revive.  Something
happened, we're still not sure what, and his body started to
deteriorate.  We were able to save the brain and transfer it
to the shell of a prototype android.  We re-worked the
prototype to allow for life-support and that's how he came
into being."  He stood up and walked over to Hausthar, placing
a hand on his shoulder.  "Even though he has a metallic body,
he is as human as you and I... son."

  The two Veritechs swooped through the air as their pilots
tried to out-fly one another in friendly competition. 
Michele's grey jet did a complete loop and found itself on the
tail of Michael's light-green Mecha.
  "Bang!  You've just been shot down, Corporal." said Michele
over the Tac-Net.  "You should watch your rear more often."
  "Sorry." apologised Michael.  "Guess I've been watching
yours too much."
  "I don't mind," laughed Michele "but I think the Commander
won't be too happy if we bring these planes back full of
holes."
  "Nah!  Commander Hayes's never happy anyway." replied
Michael.  "How about lunch in New Detroit?"
  "Isn't it outside of our area?  You know who patrols the New
Detroit sector."
  "So what?  I can't help it if Hunter's gonna be where we
want to eat.  So what do you say?"
  Michele didn't even take time to think.  "You got yourself a
date, mister."  The Veritechs rose and banked as they made for
New Detroit.

  Victor watched through the window as Hausthar left the
building.  It was not until the figure had disappeared that he
finally spoke.  "Did you tell him?"
  Lang sighed as he looked up from the papers he was reading. 
"He knew already." he admitted.  "I did nothing more than
confirm his suspicions.  Although I must say that you took the
news much better when it was told to you."
  "May I remind you, Doctor, that the only reason I know what
I am is because you were careless enough to let a certain
dossier of yours fall into my hands.  I am certain you would
have been quite happy to let me go through life not knowing."
accused Victor.
  "I guess it's true." answered Lang.
  Victor turned back towards the window, pensive.  "Theirs not
to make reply; Theirs not to reason why; Theirs but to do and
die."
  "What was that?" queried Lang.
  "A poem from the Nineteenth Century.  It talks about an
absurd military order.  And even though those that were to
carry it out knew it was suicidal, the order was still
obeyed."
  Lang leaned back in his seat, staring at the sky through the
window, thinking back to the war against the Zentraedi,
thinking of Hausthar and Michele.  "How appropriate."

  Hausthar was sitting at his booth in the Black Pegasus,
gazing at the glass of vodka in front of him, debating whether
or not to drink it.  A shadow fell over the glass. 
"Hausthar?"
  He glanced up and saw Ricky standing next to him.  "So. 
What now?  Am I supposed to roll over and beg?  Or do I go out
and crawl up to whoever's in charge?"  A hurt look came across
Ricky's face.  "Sorry." he apologised.  "I guess it was
uncalled for."
  "It's all right," replied Ricky in a small voice, sitting
down next to him "I understand what it is like to be used.  I
am in the same boat you are..."  She breathed in deeply before
continuing.  "My real name is Muriel.  I was part of the
civilian contingent carried on the SDF-1.  I 'died' during the
assault on Dolza's command-ship, when a stray missile
destroyed the bunker I was in.  It nearly killed me." 
  Tears started to appear in the corners of her eyes. "With
the ship's gravity turned off, I drifted until I made my way
to the engines.  The last thing I remember clearly is one of
the engines opening up like a gigantic maw, and something that
looked like a gigantic crystalline model of an atom."  She
sniffed before continuing.
  "Everything's a blur after that.  I think I remember some
sort of rectangular bath-tub, filled with green goo.  When I
came to again, I had changed into what you see.  Not that I
mind..." she tried to joke.  The attempt fell flat.  "I chose
the name Ricky for myself.  And I soon learned that I was able
to do things the average person could only dream about -
controlling the Power generated by Protoculture.  I was
scared, I didn't know what to do."
  She looked up straight into Hausthar's eyes, her voice
revealing the strain of her emotions, eyes brimming with
tears.  "Then I saw three shadowy figures appear in front of
me, and they told me I was to teach you how to use these
powers I had.  I can't begin to tell you how glad I was that
there was another like me... that I was not a freak..." she
broke down, crying.
  <A freak>, thought Hausthar.  <I know how you feel>.  He
reached over and pulled her close to him in an effort to
comfort her.  She buried her head in his arms and wept.

  Michael and Michele had been eating in a restaurant just
outside the New Detroit airfield when the attack began:
several Male Power-Armors swooped on the city, opening fire
indiscriminantly on civilian and military targets alike.  As
things were, they were the only RDF personnel in New Detroit
at the time, so the newcomers had pretty much the run of the
city.
  A short dash across the road brought the pilots to their
Mecha and soon the air was filled with laser-fire being
exchanged.  Michele looked to her left, towards the city's
council building, and saw several Zentraedi workers enter it,
destroying surveillance cameras on the way.
  "Michael, take a look at four O'clock and tell me what these
bozos are doing."
  Michael glanced quickly over his shoulder and swore.  "Damn,
they're going for the Protoculture sizing chamber.  We can't
let them get their hands on that thing."  The chamber was a
Robotech device allowing the Zentraedi to artificially alter
their height from sixty feet-tall giants to human-size and
back.  Not something to allow to fall in the wrong hands. 
"Problem is, if we stop chasing these Armors, they'll start
firing at the city again."
  "Way ahead of you on that one." responded Michele.  "Skull
Thirteen to SDF-2, do you read?"
  The screen in front of her rezzed to life as SDF-2 Control
responded.  "SDF-2 to Skull Thirteen, Commander Hayes
speaking.  What is your problem?"
  "We have a Malcontent attack on New Detroit - three Male
Power Armors and several Zentraedi on foot, full sized and
micronised.  We can take care of the Armors but it seems that
the others are trying to take possession of the Sizing Chamber
that's stored here."
  "Roger Skull Thirteen.  Concentrate on the Armors, we are
sending help on the way.  SDF-2 out."  The screen de-rezzed,
once again showing tactical information on the fighting. 
Michael's face appeared on one of the side screens, eyebrow
cocked questioningly.
  "So, what are we to do?"
  "The usual." replied Michele.  "We go down there and wrestle
with the Armors and try not to get our asses kicked.  Which
one do you want?"
  Michael looked at his screen before answering, studying the
information on it.  "You're better at stunt flying than I am,
so I guess I'll leave the slippery one to you and take on the
other two.  Just make sure you don't take too long and leave
me stuck with all the work."
  Both Veritechs peeled off, running after their own quarries,
lasers unleashing megawatts of energy.  Michele flew after her
target, dog-tailing it as it twisted and turned in an effort
to evade her.

  Hausthar was feeling a little silly, standing in the middle
of the park, head facing the sky, eyes closed in meditation. 
Ricky was standing next to him, in the same position, talking
him through the exercise.  "Image the world around you, as you
remember it.  Let your mind flow through that creation of your
thoughts.  Let it wander, don't try to force it to go
anywhere.  Just let it flow with the wind.  Now think of
energy, of Protoculture.  Relax."
  Hausthar did as he was told and gasped in surprise as a
crystal clear picture of the surrounding area appeared in his
mind.  All over the picture, waves of force flowed through,
like a rolling sea.  He let his mind wander towards the origin
of the waves and found himself in a place whose details
shivered, forbidding any clear identification.  In front of
him was a brilliant light, brighter than anything he'd ever
seen, but still allowing him to look straight into it.  He
concentrated on it and felt the light gathering force.  The
light suddenly sprang towards him and would surely have hit if
a shadow hadn't come between it and its target, jarring
Hausthar out of his concentration.  "What happened?" he
gasped.
  "I had to stop you." explained Ricky  "You were about to tap
into a generator.  And I don't think you're ready for that
sort of power."
  Hausthar sat down next to her on the grass, leaning on one
hand.  "So what can I do with that power?"
  Ricky looked at him with a frown.  "I don't know what <you>
can do, but theoretically it is possible to create energy
shields, power-balls, power javelins, and so forth.  You can
also totally drain a generator in a matter of microseconds and
shape it at will.  Theoretically you have total control over
the Protoculture Energy.  In practice, however..."  She
shrugged.  "Personally, I have yet to be able to create a
shield, although I'm quite good at generating power-balls. 
They come in handy for disrupting power-grids."
  "Isn't it possible to kill with this?"
  "I don't know, I never tried.  What you do is disrupt the
power-connections in your target... you short-circuit it in
other words.  I suppose that if you poured enough power into
it, you could kill someone."
  "And what about this Protoculture and Neoculture business. 
How do I know which I am using?" he enquired.
  Ricky sighed.  "I thought I'd already explained that one. 
There are no such entities, just reflections on how you use
the power.  You know the saying 'total power corrupts
totally'?  Well you have control over ultimate power -
Protoculture.  How you use it is up to you, but it is
intoxicating.  Once you have used it, you long to use it again
and again.  Those that give in to that craving do not care how
or why they use the power.  That's when they start to slide. 
A shadow falls over their hearts and minds.  They care about
nothing else - they become children to the Shadow.  And pretty
soon, the power starts to eat them up from the inside.  They
begin to use more and more of it, as often as possible and
their bodies just can't cope with that much power."
  Ricky pointed towards the fountain next to them.  "Your body
is like that fountain: with the right amount of water at the
right pressure, it all goes well, and it looks pretty.  But if
you put too much water in it, or if you increase the pressure
to much, it becomes destructive to the fountain and deadly to
both it and those around it.  That's what ultimately happens
to all of us, the power burns us up.  But if we use as little
of it as possible, we can die of old age before that happens. 
Children of the Shadow, however, care not about what happens,
they only see what is in front of them, what the power can
give them.  They burn twice as bright... but for only half as
long."
  Two lovers walked by, intertwined.  Hausthar heard Ricky
sigh as she stared at them.  "Do you know how much I crave for
a normal life again?  To be able to love someone without
wondering if tomorrow will be the day I burn up?  To be able
to hold someone tightly without fearing that they'll discover
who I am and hate me for it?"  She sighed again.  "But that's
my lot, and now that I've drawn it I must make the best of
it."
  She laid back on the grass, staring at the sky before
speaking again.  "Just promise me that you will fight the
urge, that you won't give in to it?  Please, it'd mean so much
to me."
  Hausthar looked at her longingly as he answered "I promise."

  Michele dodged in and out of the Armor's laser fire.  She
released a couple of missiles, but the pilot of the Armor
evaded them with ease.  Her commanding officer chose this
particular time to remind her he existed.
  "Skull One to Skull Thirteen.  How are things going over
where you are?"
  <The usual perfect timing, commander.>  Michele avoided an
incoming particle-beam before answering.  "Just the usual,
Lieutenant Hunter; Malcontents trying to make off with a piece
of Robotechnology.  We've got the Mecha pretty well handled,
but we can't go after those on foot."
  Hunter rogered her report before continuing.  "We'll be
there in five minutes.  Can you hold out that long?"
  Who does he think we are, thought Michele.  A bunch of
amateur?  But it was Michael who answered first.  "I think we
can manage, Sir.  But we'll still be happier when you do show
up."
  "I roger that." said Hunter.  "ETA four minutes, see you
then."  His face disappeared from their screens.
  Michele's thoughts turned back to the fighting at hand just
in time to see the Power Armor engage her in hand-to-hand
combat.  She mechamorphed to Battloid, GU-11 still strapped to
her right fore-arm.  The Armor's pilot tried to get her in a
half-nelson, but she slipped from his grasp and power-punched
the Mecha's sensors.
  The Battloid's right hand and fore-arm disappeared into the
enemy Mecha.  The pilot had barely enough time to realise that
the thing tearing through his console was the enemy's GU-11
before the gattling emptied most of its rounds into his face. 
The Armor falling towards the ground lifelessly, Michele
disengaged her Battloid's arm from the useless Mecha and
searched for her wingman.  A shout for help brought her Mecha
around.
  Michael was in trouble - his Veritech shot in several
places, it had been grabbed by the remaining Armors and was
being carried away at great speed.
  "<MICHAEL!>" cried Michele.  "What's going on?"
  Michael's voice was resigned as he spoke.  "They shot my
engines.  And the self-destruct mechanism is down as well. 
Wonder who the little sod is who didn't devise a fail-safe on
this thing.  Michele, I've got worse news - my mechamorphosys
circuits are intact... and I can't get to them."
  Michele gasped at the news.  It was a long-standing order of
the RDF not to let the circuits permitting the Veritechs to
change mode fall into enemy hands, no matter what the cost. 
"I'm going to shoot.  Eject!"
  Michael laughed, a laugh that ended in a wet cough.  On the
screen, Michele saw him spit blood.  "I've got more bad news. 
I got shot through the seat - can't eject.  Probably wouldn't
survive if I did... "  He paused as he wiped the blood from
his chin.  "Michele, I want you to destroy my Veritech."
  "But Mic..."
  "<No buts!>" interrupted Michael.  "You know the orders.  No
intact circuit must fall into enemy hands.  Now shoot!"
  Michele shook her head, trying to dismiss this reality as a
bad dream, tears rolling down her cheeks.  <I'll always be
around if you need me>, a voice echoed through her mind.  She
screamed. "<MICHAEL!!>"
  The pilots of the Armors panicked as their power readings
faded into nothingness.  The three Mecha hung in the air,
holding one another in a sick parody of a hug.  A flash of
light appeared from the helpless Veritech - it grew outward
into a ball, encompassing all three Mecha.  The ball of light
suddenly disappeared, revealing the war machines untouched...
then a gigantic explosion ruptured all three at the same time,
shrapnel raining to the ground.
  Michele landed her Battloid, jumped out and searched the
debris, hoping against hope that Michael had survived.  She
wept openly as she rummaged about, sobbing his name into the
wind.
  "Michael..."
  Up above, four Veritechs screamed through the sky... the re-
inforcements had finally arrived.

                          CHAPTER 12

  The weird thing was, I had been training for over two months
with Ricky.  And I was getting good, if a little sloppy.  Then
along came this young woman and she flattened me!  This is not
something I was prepared to forgive and forget, no matter who
the other person was.
                Hausthar C. Reneth, DIARIES OF A BROKEN HEART.

  Give me five good reasons as to why I should let you live.
                                               Michele Cequor.


  The base's psychoanalysts had told her she needed a holiday
and had packed her off to the Antarctic Base in way of rest. 
Her posting there had been termed '...temporary, until you
feel better.'  This had been over three months ago, in
September.  It was now late December, a cold day with snow
beginning to fall from grey clouds onto the streets of New
Macross.  Michele's plane started its approach to the airbase,
passing over the top of the old SDF-1 and the newly-built SDF-
2, two gigantic monoliths back-to-back.  Michele gazed at the
two Dimensional Fortresses, wondering when she would have a
chance to experience the wonders of a deep-space mission.
  The transport plane landed and proceeded to unload its
passengers at the military air-terminal.  Michele grabbed her
bags and walked out briskly, feeling an urge to be re-united
with her Veritech fighter, to loose herself in the technology
it represented, to forget about... <Michael>.  She fought down
a welling of tears and quickly wiped her nose before meeting
those that she knew awaited her.
  Miriya Sterling waved at her, trying to get her attention. 
Michele moved through the throng in an effort to get to her,
gave up, and followed a parabolic course instead.  Miriya
greeted her warmly.
  "Good to see you again Michele.  How was your time at the
Antarctic base?"
  "Fine, thank you Ma'am." responded Michele.
  Miriya looked Michele over, feeling something was not right. 
She could not put her finger on it until she looked into her
eyes.  A queer feeling overcame her as she did so - Michele's
eyes were dead, reflecting none of the life one would expect
to see.  <It's as though she herself has died>, thought
Miriya.  "Max is waiting for us." she finally said out loud. 
"He's keeping the engine warm.  It's quite chilly outside."
  Michele gazed at her, showing no emotion.  "Not as cold as
the Antarctic Ma'am."  <Not as cold as I feel inside.>

  For over two months now Hausthar had been training with
Ricky, honing his skills in this new-found power.  He was
sitting in a secluded corner of a public park in New Macross,
concentrating on this new exercise.  A shimmering screen
appeared in front of him, light appeared and took on a
physical form, like the outline of a hemisphere.  Ricky
watched a moment more, then threw a rock at him.  The
projectile flew towards Hausthar but bounced off the wall of
light and came to rest a few meters away.
  Ricky walked over to Hausthar and sat next to him.  "You're
getting better, your shield was stronger this time.  You still
seem to have trouble controlling the aspect of the energy
though.  I felt the wall slipping into a power-lance for a
second before the stone hit it."
  Hausthar sighed and leant back onto the grass.  "So sue me. 
It's not exactly easy you know - two months ago I couldn't
even light a match on purpose.  At least now I am able to
control when I use the power."
  "You'll never be able to totally control its coming and
going." warned Ricky.  "Sometimes it pops up without being
solicited.  The trick is to learn to take action quickly when
it does occur."  She laid beside him, head on his chest.
  Time passed as they watched the sky and listened to the
birds, savoring each other's company.  Ricky was first to
break the silence.  "Hausthar, why did Doctor Lang bring you
to New Macross?  And why did he bring that infernal plane with
him?"
  Hausthar laughed.  "I think he's going to make a last ditch
effort at having the Alpha placed back at the top of
Research's agenda.  As for me, I guess he decided it was time
to introduce me to the scientists here.  Think of it - Lang
presenting his son, the clone.  If this stunt doesn't give him
more clout with the council, I don't know what will.  People
say Lang doesn't understand normal people.  That's where they
make a terrible mistake: he is the best I have seen at bending
people's will to his decisions.  The perfect chairman, the
ultimate spokesperson.  Too bad he's a scientist, he'd make a
good plenipotentiary."

  "We've kept it in perfect condition for your return." 
Miriya explained.  "We were sure you'd want to use it again."
  Michele stepped pass her and walked over to the grey
Veritech, resting her hand onto it.  "Thank you very much.  I
appreciate it."
  Max took a step towards her.  "Michele... Ballistic's been
studying the wreckages for three months now, and they still
can't figure out what happened.  They say it was obviously an
explosion but aren't able to detect what sort of explosive was
used.  What happened out there?"
  Michele pressed her fore-head against the plane's cool metal
skin, a sharp contrast to her fevered brow.  She thought back
to Michael's final words, to her reaction.  She closed her
eyes as the hurt flooded in.  "I... I did it.  I caused the
explosion."
  "What?" Max and Miriya both gasped at the same time.
  "If you check, you'll find that the two Armors' Protoculture
Generators were drained and that Michael's exploded.  I made
it happen..."  Tears flowed from Michele's eyes.  "He kept His
promise.  I swore allegiance to Him and He gave me the power. 
And I used it to destroy the Mecha."  The hand that had been
resting on the Veritech clenched into a fist.  "But I wasn't
able to save Michael.  With all this power at my control I let
him die."
  Miriya stepped forward and placed a hand on her shoulder. 
"You said 'Power'.  What power...?  <Protoculture?>  Is that
why the Armor's generators were drained?" she inquired.
  "Yes." sobbed Michele, her body shacking with the sorrow
that was sweeping through her.  Miriya pulled away, realising
there was nothing she could do, that Michele was best left
alone with her grief.  She stepped out, followed by Max, and
paused outside.
  "Do you think what I think?" she asked him.
  "You mean about what Dr. Zand said?"
  "Yes.  You heard what Michele said happened.  And if it can
happen to her, what about... ?"  She left the question
unfinished.
  Max reflected on the subject a while before finally
answering.  "I think Zand is right.  This expedition to the
Fantoma system might cause the same thing to happen to her.  I
think it best if we left Dana on Earth."

  Hausthar looked at Victor incredulously.  "You mean to tell
me you didn't flip out when you learned who you were?"
  Victor gave a small electronic laugh.  "Unlike you, some of
us have got a head on their shoulders.  And anyway, I never
considered myself human, did I?  So it came as no great shock
to learn that I wasn't an android either.  Thank you."  This
last remark was directed towards Ricky who had presented him
with a glass of orange juice.  She sat down next to Hausthar,
allowing Victor to continue.  "Lang's got it right; what does
it matter if you were born or artificially created?  It's how
you feel inside that counts!  Look at the Zentraedi - they're
no better off than you are, yet they consider themselves a
race in their own rights.  And they have the right idea.  A
difference that makes no difference is no difference.  I think
you should learn to live by these words.  If you cannot
differentiate between two things, then their sources, where
they are from, does not matter - they are the same when it
comes down to it."
  Hausthar leant back pensively, his arm around Ricky's
shoulders.  "I don't know... It's not the fact that I wasn't
born, it's that I was duped.  They tried to make me think I
was something I wasn't."  Ricky placed her head on his
shoulder in support.
  Victor stood up.  "I can see I'm not going to change your
mind easily." He flexed his arms as one would flex tired
muscles.  "Care for a stroll down the river-side?  Maybe I'll
be able to make you see some sense with Nature on my side."

  Michele was flying patrol over New-Macross, keeping an eye
out for Zentraedi Malcontents.  <What a way to spend Christmas
Eve>, she thought as she imaged her Veritech through a turn. 
The sky over the city was grey, promising snow without
delivering it.  Switching channels, Michele picked up the news
broadcast on MBC-Macross.  It seemed the only thing worth
reporting was the disappearance of singing sensation Lynn
Minmei.  As far as police was concerned it was a fugue.  Her
manager on the other hand had been quick to spread the story
of a romantic escapade, using the media for some cheap
publicity.  Michele smirked, knowing that before long Minmei
would appear on the doorstep of Lieutenant Hunter's
appartment, seeking his help as she always did in time of
trouble.
  Her thoughts were cut short as alarms sounded through her
cockpit: rising from the river were several Battle Pods led by
a white and red Officer's Pod.  She dove over the river, past
the wreck of a Zentraedi troop-ship that had crashed in the
middle of it.  As she cleared the top of the space-craft,
energy beams raced towards her craft, holing it in several
places, causing alarms to wail as the Jet shuddered.
  "Damn!" she exclaimed, fighting against the bucking craft. 
She looked at the river-side and saw the Battle Pods climbing
onto the bank.  As she steadied the craft into a semi-
controlled descent, she realised she would crash in the middle
of the industrial complex the Pods were now starting to
surround.

  The three of them had been walking the length of the river
bank when the fire-fight had started.  Victor immediately
radioed SDF-2 Control, asking for backup while Hausthar left
Ricky under Victor's care and ran towards the complex that was
seemingly the target of this attack.
  He was half-way to his destination when he realised he
didn't have anything to defend himself with should he be
involved in the fighting.  He had just decided on turning back
when he spied a Veritech making a forced landing in the middle
of the warehouses.  Knowing he couldn't leave a fellow pilot
fight his way out alone, Hausthar voted against retreating and
plunged headlong into Hell.

  Michele landed her plane between two of the gigantic storage
sheds, popped open the canopy and jumped out.  She got clear
just in time; a Female Power Armor swooped down and holed the
Veritech through, causing it to explode.  Michele stepped from
her hiding place and concentrated on the receding Mecha.

  Hausthar heard an explosion on his left and rounded the
Hangar in time to see a red-haired woman stare upwards at the
sky.  He looked in the same direction and saw a Female Power
Armor flying away.  Just as he recognised it, Hausthar felt a
psychic wind gathering forces in the immediate vicinity.  The
wind released its fury and the Power Armor disappeared in a
ball of light, never to be seen again.  <She has Control!>
thought Hausthar as he turned to face her.  <Then this has got
to be...> "Michele." he called out loud.
  The young woman swung around and looked at him before
answering.  "Who are you?  How do you know my name?"  A wave
of hate emanated from her, making Hausthar gasp for breath.
  "My name is Hausthar."  he answered.  "I am your brother." 
He had expected to catch her off guard with this remark, but
instead he was surprised as she burst laughing.
  "I was told I'd face you one day... Hausthar.  I warn you,
do not stand in my way.  I'll kill you if I must."  She raised
a hand towards a Power Armor that was flying overhead and
drained its generator, prompting it to crash into the river. 
Whips of energy snaked around her, adding to the conviction in
her words.
  Hausthar felt the burning power contained within her and
took a step back, unsure of what to do.

  The red-and-white Officer's Pod looked around, obviously
searching for something, its pilot impatient.  "What are you
doing Grel?!" the pilot called out to another Pod.  "You're
leading us around in circles!"
  A Battle Pod came to attention under the verbal abuse.  "The
Protoculture has got to be here somewhere, My Lord," explained
the Pod's pilot.  "My agents..."
  "Your agents are idiots!" raged the first pilot.  "Now
listen to me: your incompetence may end up costing you your
life!  Now find it!"  The Officer's Pod gestured its cannons
in a threatening manner.  It was not for nothing that its
pilot had been nicknamed 'The Backstabber'.

  "Why do you have to kill me?" asked Hausthar.  "Have I done
something to hurt you?"
  Michele glowered at him.  "He told me you'd try to stop me. 
I doubted Him.  But it looks as though He was right once
again.  You are the danger Hausthar.  You are the one who
rendered the Robotech Factory inoperative.  You are a menace
to Humanity."
  Hausthar was sweating bullet, trying to find a way to avoid
the conflict that was sure to follow.  He tried to reach into
a generator to charge up but found his way blocked.  He gave a
gasp of surprise.
  "You didn't think it would be this easy, surely." laughed
Michele.  "What, were you expecting me to let you tap into a
generator and then fry me?  Think again."
  The two of them faced off like gunslingers from the old
West.

  Frustrated by his second-in-command's inability to locate
the Protoculture storage facility, Khyron the Backstabber had
left his Mecha in search of it himself.  Armed with nothing
more than an autocannon, the sixty feet tall Zentraedi walked
down the alleys between the Hangars.  His long-time affinity
with the Invid Flower of Life had given him a special bond
with its offspring, Protoculture.  He entered a storage area,
following the strong emanations that were coming from this
location, apparently oblivious to the drama outside the
structure.  Khyron reached down to remove a tarpaulin,
revealing the Storage Matrix.  The Matrix was cylinder-like,
easily half his height and perhaps twice his weight, and
contained the Protoculture needed to power his failing Battle
Cruiser.  He grabbed the Matrix and heaved it onto his
shoulder, straining under its weight.  He hauled it back to
his Officer's Pod and attached it to the Pod's clamps,
securing it for transport.  Stepping into the cockpit, Khyron
powered-up and blasted his way out of the complex.

  Hausthar had been wondering what to do to save his life when
an Officer's Pod flew in-between Michele and him, raising up a
dust-storm.  The Pod disappeared over the buildings, its
pilot's voice booming over its external speakers.  "Attention,
Micronians!  Khyron the Destroyer wants to wish you a Merry
Christmas, and I send you a special greeting from Santa Claus. 
May all your foolish hollow-days be as bright as this one!..."
  Hausthar didn't have long to wonder what was meant by that
last statement - all over the city, explosions resounded,
sending fireballs into the sky.  Behind the settling dust,
Michele spoke to him.  "It seems I am needed elsewhere.  This
is your lucky day Hausthar.  I have not the time to kill you
today."  The voice faded as Hausthar heard the footsteps of
someone running.  By the time the dust had completely settled,
Michele had disappeared.

  " ...It appears as though Khyron had one of his micronised
warrior disguised as a Santa Claus, placing bombs all over the
city by giving booby-trapped gifts to children on the
streets."  Victor was pacing up and down the room, relaying
his information to Hausthar and Ricky.  "To make matters even
worse, Khyron escaped with enough Protoculture to power-up his
Battleship and report to the Robotech Masters about the
location of the SDF-1.  If the Masters ever hear of this,
we'll have another inter-galactic fight on our hands."
  "Excuse me," interrupted Ricky, "but it seems we have
another more important problem on our hands: Michele."
  "What do you mean?" asked Hausthar.
  "You told us that Michele had drained a generator of its
power, but hadn't used it?  That means she is walking around
like a charged-up battery waiting to explode, and the
slightest thing can set her off.  Your problem is not Khyron
and his battle-cruiser, your problem is a woman walking around
with enough energy to destroy the Northern Hemisphere!"

                          CHAPTER 13

  History recorded the last moments of the SDF-1... or so
everybody thought.  Because if it was the complete coverage,
why did the SDF's main gun misfire so badly?  Why did the
magnetic bottling of its energies give way in such a
stupendous way?  I tell you there must have been other factors
involved that day than simply a shooting match between two
Battle-Cruisers.
                  Exedore, as quoted in Lapstein's Interviews.

  I just keep burning love...
                                  Late Twentieth Century song.


  "In a way, she is right." concluded Ricky.  "With your
inexperience at handling Protoculture, you're as big a threat
to humanity as she is - so it may be she has decided that to
save the Earth you must be destroyed."
  "Thanks for the words of comfort." replied Hausthar.  They
were both sitting outside a small cafe in New Macross,
watching the grey sky, trying to find a solution to the
dilemma they faced.  "So what do we do about her?"
  "I wish I knew." sighed Ricky.  "Normally, we'd just home in
on her power emanations... I tried that this morning." she
continued quickly as Hausthar opened his mouth to speak. 
"Nothing.  She seems to be able to block me as if I were a
child."  Hausthar closed his mouth, looking dejected.
  "The next move is up to her then." he reflected.

  Standing atop a hill just outside town, Michele smiled as
she jumped down from her plane.  She'd had to steal this new
Veritech, red tape would have demanded another week before she
was assigned a new one.  It didn't matter anymore - after
today, her mission would be over, one way or the other.  Neo
had warned her of his trickiness, but she had doubted Him. 
And then, as if to prove that He was always right, Hausthar
had somehow managed to set off explosions in the centre of New
Macross, forcing her to let him live, knowing her Oath would
make her run to help the civilians.
  She snorted in disgust at Hausthar's choice of tactics.  If
he so enjoyed involving civilians, she wanted to see how he
would react once the tables were turned.  <It's time to flush
out the rats>, she thought.  Behind her, still on the other
side of the horizon, a Zentraedi Battle-Cruiser made its
approach towards the city and the two Fortresses lying in the
lake at its centre.
  Michele sensed its approach - its commander was taking great
pains to ensure he would not be detected.  She wondered if he
knew that the flight path he was following would not hide him
from the city's radar defenses.  It did not matter - Michele
let out her breath in a long, drawn-out sigh and concentrated
on the cruiser, bending the radar signals beamed in its
direction, rendering it invisible to the city's defenses.
  She smiled.

  The first wave of missiles struck the industrial complexes,
sending shockwaves throughout the city, smashing windows. 
Hausthar picked himself up off the floor and looked about -
all around him was chaos, people fleeing towards shelters. 
Ricky stood next to him and grabbed his arm with both her
hands, seeking not to loose him in the confused throng that
was amassing.
  The message reached them without interference, as if spoken
into their ears by someone standing next to them.  <Hausthar!>
  He looked around but could not see who had uttered the
words.
  "Telepathy." Ricky shouted over the sounds of panic. 
"Michele must be trying to get in contact with you."
  Hausthar closed his eyes and concentrated on the name. 
<Michele?  Is that you?>
  <How clever of you to hide in a crowd where I can't shoot
you.>
  <Where are you, what do you want with me?>
  <You are dangerous, Hausthar.  You proved it to me
yesterday.  So I'm challenging you - and to make sure you
won't refuse the challenge, I helped someone pass the city's
defenses.  If you want to stop him, you'll have to fight me
first.>
  Hausthar blinked in surprise.  <Who?  Who did you let pass?>
  The answer came as the voice faded away - <Khyron.>
  "If Khyron has managed to slip in, then the entire city is
doomed." said Ricky.  "And there's nothing we can do about
it."
  "Yes we can..." seethed Hausthar, his hands clenched into
fists, "We can take up her challenge."

  The guards at the base's hangar were entrenched as waves
upon waves of missiles buffeted the area.  In the middle of
the destruction, one of them spied two figures running towards
the bunker, weaving their way past the explosions.  He shouted
to the soldier nearest the door to open it and both figures
burst through a second later.  The soldier who had opened the
door closed it behind them and smiled.  "You're lucky to have
made it this far."
  Hausthar brushed the dust off his leather jacket and looked
him in the eyes.  "How are the Veritechs in there?"
  The guard looked at Hausthar in surprise for a moment, then
reached for his gun, pointing it towards him.  "How do you
know about the Veritechs?  No-one but Lang's supposed to..." 
His protest was cut short as he heard a commotion behind him. 
Turning around, he barely had time to see the other guards
falling to the ground before being stunned by an energy bolt.
  Hausthar opened the door leading to the hangar and rushed
in, tripping several alarms along the way.  He did not worry
about them - by the time anyone was in any shape to respond he
would be far away.  He raced past several prototypes, his
subconscious registering their presence - AJACS, Logan, Hover
Tank - and made a bee-line for the new Alpha prototype.  He
jumped into the cockpit, keying in the warm-up sequence,
sending control codes to open the hangar's automatic doors.  A
sharp whistling sound came to him over the Alpha's low
throbbing.  Seconds later a Logan in Guardian mode hovered
over to him.  The Logan looked like an ancient row-boat with
arms and legs and was barely taller than two man.
  "Ricky?!  What are you doing?  You crazy or something?" he
shouted over the Net.
  Ricky's face appeared on his commo screen, donned with the
Veritech's thinking-cap.  "You didn't really think I was going
to let you go out alone, did you?  And anyway, you'll need a
back-up out there to watch your tail."  The automatic door
opened in front of them.  "Well?" she asked.
  Hausthar sighed.  "All right."  He brought the throttle to
full and sped out of the hangar, closely followed by Ricky.

  The battle outside had reached new heights - Battle Pods,
weapon depleted, were making suicidal runs at Veritechs trying
to keep the Zentraedi Cruiser from reaching the SDFs. 
Hausthar and Ricky plunged into the chaos, avoiding stray
missiles and staying out of the line of fire of the
combatants.  Hausthar checked his weapon display and grumbled. 
"They didn't load any missiles on this thing - I've only got
the GU-XX.  What about you?"
  Ricky looked down and read the displays.  "No missiles
either," she told him, "but my energy gun is fully loaded." 
She banked right to move out of the way of a falling Pod.  "I
still can't locate her."
  Looking out the cockpit, Hausthar searched the skies.  "Then
we look until we do find her."

  The battle raged around them and prevented them from finding
Michele.  Hausthar and Ricky were about to give up when the
grey Veritech swooped out of the sky and shot at Ricky's
Logan.  The Logan took several hits in the wing as it darted
forward to place itself out of the Veritech's line of fire. 
Hausthar turned his Alpha skyward and rocketed towards the
Jet, GU-XX gun pod blazing, sending H.E.A.T. rounds to the
target.
  Michele brought her Mecha around and was about to retaliate
when a spear of light flashed between the opposing parties. 
Taking its roots from Khyron's Battle-Cruiser, the beam
extended until it reached the mid-section of the SDF-2,
released its hold on Khyron's ship and seemingly retracted
into its target.  An eternity passed where nothing happened -
the SDF-2 stood as rigid as ever within the lake, its 'face'
turned towards its aggressor.  Finally it could hold no more
and let the energy have its way.  Fire and explosions gushed
from its side as secondary blasts made their way up and down
the Fortress.  The force of the destruction shook and moved
the battleship - it started to list, collided with the wreck
of the SDF-1 and laid there, mortally wounded.
  Shouts of despair filled the Tactical Net.  Hausthar
listened half-heartedly to the damage report, not wanting to
face the possibility that this might be the day the Zentraedi
Malcontents would finally win.  The SDF-2 had suffered a major
hit and was now so much scrap metal, the control room was
virtually destroyed, as for the guns... a voice cut in, full
of disdain.  "Well, <brother>?  Are you ready to face me?  Or
do I help Khyron once more?"
  Hausthar fought down a shout of anger and turned on the
commo screen.  Michele's face coalesced into existence.  He
looked into her eyes and saw no pity in them, only
determination to finish what she had begun.  Nevertheless, he
still tried to reason with her.  "You are wrong about me,
Michele.  I am not evil, and neither do I believe you are. 
Why do you want to kill me?  What purpose could it serve?"
  "You are dangerous, too dangerous to be allowed to live... 
Neo told me you were responsible for Michael's death..."  She
failed to hear Hausthar's gasp of dismay.  "I didn't believe
Him at first, but your actions yesterday proved that I was
wrong, that I should have trusted Him."
  Hausthar realised that Michele was slowly breaking under the
strain of the energies in her, that her psyche had focused on
the Shadow side of the Protoculture as an external entity.  He
tried to make use of that fact as he banked his plane to face
hers.  "You are still wrong.  The only difference between us
two is that Neoculture offers and delivers quickly, but Its
price is often too high to pay.  It is the way of deceit, of
treachery, of lies.  Is Michael alive?  Is he to be
resurrected by my death?  What were you asked for in return
for your power?  Look at yourself - you only think of
destruction.  You are loosing what is left of you to the
Shadow."
  "You do not know what you are talking about, Hausthar."  The
voice was full of sarcasm.  "I was good all my life, and I
still am.  But if I have to stray slightly from the path to
help the world and kill you, I will do it gladly.  You know I
am the best, and it was given me to know about you, and your
plans - and that you and I were clones."
  Ricky's face appeared next to Michele's on Hausthar's
screen.  "I can't believe this!  It's the most advance case of
pre-cognition I have ever seen - either that or a very strong
telepath.  We can't kill her."
  "In case you have yet to notice" responded Hausthar "she
doesn't seem to share the same feelings about me."  He
switched back to Michele.  "I still do not believe you made
the right choice.  The Shadow is blocking your mind to the
Light."  <I'm starting to sound like a B-grade sci-fi movie>,
he reflected.
  "Enough!  It is high time we finished our business.  I
challenge you to a duel - your will versus mine, no holds
barred.  Then we will know who was right and who was wrong."
  Ricky spoke again, her face distorted with worry.  "Haust?
Are you sure you want to... ?"
  "Yes Ricky...  Very well Michele, I accept your challenge." 
The three Veritechs lowered themselves to a patch of ground on
the banks of Lake Gloval, by the shadow of the Fortresses.

  <Inside the wreck of the SDF-1, power readings were making
their appearance.  On the bridge of the broken-down Fortress,
the newly re-assembled crew prepared for their defender's
final battle.  A race against time was being fought as
Khyron's ship slowly swung around for a better angle.>

  They formed a triangle with Ricky's apex closest to the
lake, facing each other like duelists from an old western-
style movie.  None dare make a move to break the mood and thus
precipitate disaster.  The silence was broken by a Veritech
fly-by; three Veritechs - black and white, red, and blue -
flew off to intercept Khyron's Battle-Fortress.
  Ricky was the first to break the stand-off.  Reaching
outward, she connected with her Logan's Protoculture
generator, pumping it for all it was worth.  The energy snaked
between her and the ship as the transfer was being
effectuated.  As soon as the generator was drained, Ricky held
her arms straight, hand clasped together, fore-fingers
slightly apart and pointing at Michele - her fingers became a
scaled-down re-creation of the SDF-1's main gun, energy
flickering from one digit to the other.  In a brief display of
fury, the energy left her fingers and leapt towards Michele. 
It never reached her; left arm extended to concentrate her
will, Michele had stopped the powerball barely a meter from
her body.  She reshaped it into a lance and sent it whence it
came.
  Hausthar's heart sank as he saw that Ricky hadn't realised
what had happened.  His voice screamed into the chaos that was
surrounding them.  "Ricky! <No!>"  His warning came too late -
 the lance of light buried itself in Ricky's left shoulder and
disappeared from view.  Her knees buckled as she ever-so-
slowly fell to the ground.

  <Orders had come from the bridge, the old fortress was re-
activated.  Unaware of the tragedy unfolding near it, the SDF-
1 fired its engines and slowly climbed to the sky as a small
figure next to it fell down.  Commander Hayes asked for a
status report and searched the skies for a black-and-white
Veritech.>

  "<RICKY!>"  Hausthar's rage and feeling of emptiness could
not stop her from reaching the ground in a small heap, her
face turning deathly pale.
  Hausthar turned his attention back towards Michele.  Try as
he might, he simply could not generate a powerball the way
Ricky had.  Michele, however, did not seem to have such
problems.  Reaching outward to a shot-down mecha, she pumped
what was left of its generator to create a small ball of
energy and hurled it towards him.  Hausthar dove for cover
behind a pile of rubble as the ball hit the ground where he
had stood just a few moments before.

  <On the bridge, conversation was running wild.  Claudia
Grant looked up from her console and called out  "Main gun is
in ready position.  Energy reading at present... niner-five-
zero."  Her face turned anxiously towards the figure standing
at the console on her left.
  "The admiral was right -" answered Commander Hayes "that's
only enough energy for one shot, so make it a good one."
  Preparations continued as Khyron's ship closed in, spewing
forth death in the shape of laser beams.>

  Hausthar had already had to dodge a second powerball before
making it to relative safety.  None of the Veritechs that were
left had enough power in them to help him.  He relaxed and let
his mind enter the alpha state.  Quickly, methodically, he
searched his surroundings with his mind, looking for
Protoculture to use for his defence.

  <Deep within the SDF-1's massive sealed engines, an
intelligence sensed the search.  The battle on the shore of
Lake Gloval played a very small part in the overall Shaping of
things, but the players were major participants.  Following
decisions made eons ago, the intelligence followed its path;
lowering the shield it had maintained for so long, the
Protoculture contained within the engines allowed itself to be
discovered.>

  Hausthar connected with a source of Protoculture and began
the drain.  Concentrating it in front of himself, he stepped
out into the open.  As soon as she saw him, Michele sent
another powerball his way - the powerball roared as it flew
towards him, finally crashing on the Protoculture-generated
shield in front of its target.  Hausthar felt his shield
weaken as the powerball sapped its strength.

  <The radar operator on the bridge turned towards the
captain's chair.  Vanessa's voice was cool with confidence. 
"Admiral Gloval, Khyron's ship is centered in the computer
reticle sir."
  Gloval did not even bother to raise his head as he yelled
"<Now>, fire!">

  Knowing the powerball would break through his shield
otherwise, Hausthar reached deep into the Consciousness and
the power he had tapped and took out another great chunk of it
to consolidate his shield.

  <On the bridge of the SDF, controls started to beep for
attention, sending warnings out to the crew.  Claudia checked
her instruments and gasped, a tremor in her voice. 
"Instruments show power dropping."
  A small voice came from the back of the room as one of the
techs answered.  "Reflex engines are losing power."
  Vanessa looked at Gloval, a plea in her eyes.  "Sammie's
right - the gun's magnetic bottling is giving way."
  Gloval listened and shook his head in understanding.  They
all knew what would happen when the bottling finally
ruptured.>

  A second powerball had joined the first and was slowly
making progress through his shield.  Hausthar panicked,
reached out into the contact he had made and drained as much
as he dared from the power-source.

  <Kim's voice wandered through the bridge as the tech slumped
in her seat, resigned.  "It's gone."  They waited for the
inevitable to happen.>

  <The energies that had been building around the SDF's main
gun coalesced into a spear of blinding light.  The power-web
surrounding it solidified for an instant - then the twin booms
of the gun blowtorched.
  A nearly hemispherical flash of power encompassed the gun,
destroying its electronics, stripping the plating off its
surface, melting the infrastructure.  A bolt of energy leapt
from the hemisphere and wavered towards Khyron's ship. 
Without the guidance of the magnetic bottling, the shot went
astray and only grazed the cruiser's left side instead of
holing it from end to end.  The wounded cruiser belched fire
and smoke from its side but kept on coming, sights centered on
the SDF-1.>

  As the SDF-1 fell back into the lake, its twin booms falling
apart like ashes from two spent cigars, Hausthar was knocked
off his feet by the quake.  Both powerballs were released from
the shield and whizzed harmlessly past his head.  Anger filled
Hausthar's mind - anger for the thousands of millions of
people killed by the Zentraedi, anger at being a pawn in a
game of galactic chess, and most of all anger at the thought
of having lost Ricky.  He gathered his shield into a wall of
energy ten feet across and concentrated on it.  Just as
Khyron's ship was closing in on the SDF-1's bridge, so was
Hausthar projecting his shield towards Michele.  Just as the
SDF did not have time to react, neither did Michele understand
the tactic until too late - the energy from the shield
enveloped her as the two great ships collided with one
another.
  The last thing Hausthar remembered were explosions as the
ships crashed into the ground, and a searing pain as the heat
from the blast reached him.  When the darkness came for him he
welcomed it, his last thoughts being for Ricky.

                           EPILOGUE

Another Christmas night,
Another chance for us to make everything
Turn out alright.
We must bring back the joy
Which lights up children's eyes
Whenever they see a toy -
  Thus is the Peace which we must make,
  If not for us then for our children's sake.
                                 From Lynn Minmei's "Look Up".


  Hausthar came to much later, his head throbbing dully,  A
quick glance gave an appraisal of the situation - the SDF-1,
SDF-2 and Khyron's Cruiser were lying in a smoking heap.  A
medical team was going through a nearby pile of rubble,
administering aid to those who needed it, giving novocaine to
those beyond help.  Choppers had landed nearby, bearing the
familiar red cross.  Another had touched ground slightly away
from the others and bore the Robotech Research and Development
logo on its side.  Two faces hovered above him.  By a sheer
act of will he forced them into focus.  Lang and Victor's
features revealing themselves.
  "What happened?"  His mouth felt like lead.
  Lang turned towards the wreckage of the Fortresses, his
voice filled with sarcasm.  "We won."
  "Most of the crew of the SDFs were killed" explained Victor
"including Lang's niece.  He is still looking for his godson."
  Thoughts swam in Hausthar's mind.  "Ricky... How is she?"
  "We don't know." answered Victor.  "We've only just arrived
and the Doctor insisted on reviving you first."  He helped
Hausthar to his feet and guided him towards the place where
Ricky laid in a heap.  He let go of him and went to look at
Michele's body.
  Hausthar looked at the face he'd come to love.  A cold hand
gripped his heart as he noticed the pale face, the blue lips. 
"Ricky?"
  Her lips moved, the voice very weak.  "Haust?... Sorry I
couldn't be... of more help to you.  Who won?..."  Her eyes
looked deep inside his and the cold hand tightened its grip on
his heart.
  "Nobody did Ricky.  We all lost something today."  Tears of
frustration and anger came to his eyes and mixed with those
from his grief.  He brushed her hair away from her face and
caressed her cheeks, wishing for the colour to return to them. 
He held her tightly to his chest and whispered "Please don't
leave me.  I love you Ricky."  Tears were running down his
cheeks unchecked.
  A small hand grabbed the back of his neck and he felt his
head being pushed downward.  "I love you too, you big dummy." 
Her soft lips met his and parted, kissing him passionately. 
"Can we go now?"
  Hausthar broke from the embrace.  "Don't get me wrong, but
aren't you suppose to be dying?"
  Ricky smiled weakly.  "No, but it came close."  She pushed
him away slightly to reveal her left shoulder - beneath the
burnt fabric was a gaping wound, blood slick around it.  "That
lance knocked me down, that's all.  'Though I'm really going
to die if we stay here too long.  I'm going to freeze to
death!"
  At her last words Hausthar finally realised it was snowing
and that a small coating of snow had covered the ground.  The
wound, the cold and the fact Ricky wore only her leotards
accounted for the pale face and blue lips.  He pointed a
finger at her.  "If you ever play a dirty trick like this on
me again I'll..."
  Ricky laughed and kissed him again.  "You'll come running to
save me again."  She smiled the smile he loved so much and hid
her face in his chest.  "I love you, you know."
  Hausthar applied a patch to the wound, binding it before
they got to their feet and walked to where Victor was
kneeling.  Victor looked up and packed away the instrument he
had been holding.  "Looks like her brain really packed it in
this time.  All I get are readings more suitable for a five-
month old.  She's literally living on automatics.  What did
you <do> to her?"
  Hausthar looked at the body that had once contained the mind
of his sister.  "I panicked.  I focused the shield and sent it
straight at her."
  Ricky looked at him and squeezed his hand in support.  "It
must have completely scrambled her brain.  I'm sorry..."
  Victor got to his feet and emitted a short electronic groan. 
"Anyway, she's a job for the medics now.  There's nothing more
we can do for her."  He walked away towards the chopper where
Lang was waiting with his godson, not wanting to look back at
the chaos behind him.
  Hausthar stooped to retrieve Michele's body and held it
tight, tears flowing down his face.  No matter what anybody
said, no matter whose it was, he still hated taking a life,
any life.  He cried as he thought of the chances he had lost,
of the times he'd never had with his newly found and newly
lost sister.
  A lithe arm slid itself around his waist and squeezed it. 
"Come on Haust... Let's go home."  Ricky nudged him towards
the city and he followed, bearing Michele's body in his arms.

                                        New Story
=========================================================================================
                    The Hunter and the Hunted

     Lieutenant Brown sat in his command pod 1 kilometer away from
the enormous space hulk, a huge, derelict space ship thousands of
years old.  He sat in the dim room hunched over the console,
watching the marines move down the corridor through the camera
mounts.
     "DaCosta!" the lieutenant shouted through the comlink, "Move
your squads toward sector Zed Zed Alpha.  The main offensive
requires your presence."
     "Copy that Lieutenant, moving now," replied DaCosta.
     DaCosta had turned and made a quick count to make sure he had
all of his marines.  "Pestilato.  Take the point.  Everyone else
fall in."  A Terminator moved in front of DaCosta, its massive bulk
moving smoothly.  The footsteps rang out throughout the dark
corridor.
     Pestilato moved up the corridor, DaCosta right behind him. 
They came upon a four-way intersection, three corridors were
blocked by thick bulkheads.  The way they came was the only way
open.  "Not a problem," Pestilato said calmly.  His chain fist
juddered to life and he cut into the bulkhead.  In seconds, there
was a Terminator-sized hole where the bulkhead used to be.
     DaCosta watched carefully, looking out for genestealers.  His
bio-scanner detected an unidentifiable amount of lifeforms, about
fifty meters away and closing fast.  "DaCosta to Lieutenant Brown. 
Lifeforms detected.  Possible genestealers.  Awaiting
instructions."
     "Continue in present direction.  Any resistance should be met
with deadly force."
     "Understood," replied DaCosta.
     Pestilato saw the blips on his bio-scanner.  "Sir.  Lifeforms
detected.  Genestealers confirmed."
     "Keep cool," replied Crowe, "Don't get overzealous.  We have
to make it through.  Find a defensive position and set on
overwatch."
     Pestilato raised his storm bolter, a heavy, double barrelled,
automatic weapon that fired hollow-tipped explosive-charged
caseless rounds.  He flipped the switch that set his storm bolter
to fire faster than it was designed to.  Pestilato looked up, and
saw three genestealers closing in on him fast.
     There they were, three grotesque creatures, the stuff you
could only dream about, things so horrible that they couldn't
possibly be real.  Yet there they stood.  Three huge, ominous
creatures with large purple heads and gleaming red eyes.  They
stood at least seven feet tall and were hunched over.  Their legs
looked similiar to a dog's, with haunches and clawed feet.  They
had four arms, two with normal human hands and two with claws that
could cut through steel like it was soft butter.  This nightmare
was sheathed in a tough carapace shell.
     "Genestealers confirmed!  At least three coming in fast!" said
Pestilato as he pressed the trigger of his storm bolter.  Shot
after shot poured into the alien, creating large craters in its
shell, creating a mist of putrid green blood.  The creature
squealed and fell to the ground.
     "Nicodemus to DaCosta.  We were delayed by a surprise
Genestealer attack.  No casualties.  We should be in your area...
now."  Just then, Nicodemus stepped in followed by Fabian and
Boubonicus.  Nicodemus wore the Aegis suit of a Terminator
Librarian, a warrior with powerful psionics.  Fabian was carrying
a heavy flamer while Boubonicus was wielding Lightning claws, large
gloves with claws surging with energy designed to rip the carapace
from a genestealer's body and get at the soft flesh beneath.
     "Proceed to designated area." replied DaCosta.  "Pestilato. 
Fall back.  We're following Nicodemus."
     "Unable to comply, sir.  Genestealers are waiting just out of
my line of sight.  As soon as I - Aaaaaaarrrrgggghh!"  Just then,
Pestilato fell to the ground, a huge slash in the center of his
chest.  His blood soaked the front of his armour as well as the
claws of the genestealer who killed him.  DaCosta heard the steady
hiss of air as it escaped from Pestilato's Terminator suit.
     "Pestilato's down!" shouted DaCosta.  DaCosta fired as he
moved back to the others.  The genestealer took about fifteen
rounds to the head and countless others hit the Stealer's body.  It
was dead before it hit the ground.
     "DaCosta, this is Brown.  Pull out and move to the designated
area.  The offensive is looking grim."  DaCosta noticed that
Brown's voice was wavering, as if he was nervous or excited.
     "Iglesias reporting in sir.  I have Karell here with me."
     DaCosta turned to see his old friend.  Behind Iglesias was
Karell, a man that had the spirit of a wild stallion and great
fighting ability.  Karell was on assault cannon detail.  Although
dangerous, that's the way Karell liked things.
     "The other three are behind us.  They should be here
momentarily."
     "Good, because we don't have much time to wait.  The
genestealers are all around us.  We have to move - Aaarrggh!" 
DaCosta felt a great weight slam into him from behind.  He had
enough time to turn around and see a genestealer trying to rip him
apart.  He drew his powersword as the stealer attacked.  The clawed
hand was aimed right for his face, but DaCosta was able to get the
sword up in time.  He returned the blow, slashing the top of the
stealer's head.
     Karell positioned himself up against a wall, ready for any
stealers that came his way.
     "Stargrod here.  We have arrived.  Awaiting instructions."
     "Find a defensive position.  We have to fight off this first
wave if we are to move any further."
     By now, Fabian and Nicodemus were in a long corridor.
     "Set up, back to back formation," said Nicodemus.
     "Yes sir."  Nicodemus backed up to Fabian and fired his flamer
into an intersection that would lead a long line of stealers to the
captain and the others.  "Suppressing fire established."
     "Good.  I'm on overwatch, all we have to do is wait for the
captain and the others."  As he finished his sentence, Nicodemus
saw several genestealers advancing on his position.  He fired his
storm bolter, tearing two of them apart.  The last one managed to
dodge the high-explosive shells.  It raised its arm to slash
Nicodemus's face off.
     Nicodemus was faster.  Channelling psychic energy into his
force axe, he brought the axe down on the shoulder of the stealer,
lopping two of the arms off.  The stealer fell to the ground
squealing, trying in vain to reach the Librarian.  It soon bled to
death.  "Allright, let's move."
     "You go first.  I'll cover our advance." replied Fabian.
     "Good.  Go." said Nicodemus.
     Nicodemus moved forward as Fabian backed up.  Fabian continued
to fire his flamer at the same intersection, buying the other
marines the time they desperately needed to regroup.
     "Let's go!  Move, move, move!" shouted DaCosta, "Boubonicus! 
You take point!"
     Boubonicus moved in front of the captain.  He pulled in front
of Fabian, who had his back to him.  Boubonicus readied himself for
the stealers coming down the corridor.  The first one was on him. 
Boubonicus drew back a hand and slashed the stealer.  The lightning
claws struck the back of the stealer, tearing away the carapace. 
Boubonicus used his other hand to stab the stealer in the back. 
The claws pierced the soft flesh, killing the stealer instantly.
     Two other stealers jumped on Boubonicus, knocking him to the
ground.  He slashed fiercly with his claws, cutting deeply into a
stealer's belly, causing blood to splurt out onto Boubonicus's
armor.  He backhanded the other stealer, knocking it back.  It
charged him again.  Boubonicus lowered his claws, ready for the
stealer.  The stealer impaled itself on the claws.  It swung at
Boubonicus in a last ditch effort to kill him, but the weak blow
bounced off the armor.
     As Boubonicus pulled the claws out of the limp body, a stealer
he hadn't seen came out from the darkness.  He had no time to put
up his claws to defend himself.  The stealer pounced on him and
clawed away at his chest and arms, tearing the armor to shreds.
     "Help!  Get it off!  Get it off!  Aaaaaaarrrrggghhh!"
     DaCosta couldn't see what happened to Boubonicus, but heard
his pleas for help over the intercom.  He heard the rending of
metal and flesh, and soon, the sounds became indistinguishable.  He
then heard the sounds of bolter fire, and the squealing of a dying
stealer.
     "Keep moving!" shouted Iglesias over the noise of the battle. 
Iglesias and his squad moved down the corridor after the captain.
     Stranski, the last in line, felt a huge weight on his back
that forced him to the ground.  He heard it clawing away at his
armour.  "Help me!  Shoot it!  Shoot it!  I can't reach it with my
power glove!  Heeelllpp Mmmeeee!!"  Those were Stranski's last
words.  He felt the claws digging into his back.  The pain was
unreal.  Then he heard it clawing at the inside of his armour,
telling him that it had cut through him.  Then his world turned
black.
     Karell turned just as the stealer finished ripping Stranski
apart.  He thumbed the assault cannon to life.  The barrels spun at
fantastic speed, becoming a blur.  Bullet after bullet hit the
stealer, reducing it to a fine green mist.  After destroying it, he
turned and caught up to his fellow marines.
     "Karell, come with me.  We're taking a different corridor. 
We're gonna cut off those stealers!"
     Karell said nothing, but nodded to Iglesias.  The two
seperated from the rest at the intersection Fabian had been firing
at for so long.
     Nicodemus moved into a room.  There were three other exits. 
before he had time to think of which one to use, stealers were
bearing down on him from the right corridor and the corridor in
front of him.  He fired his storm bolter, killing two of them.  He
then backed into a corner.  There would be no relief, the others
were too far behind.
     The stealers advanced on his position.  Nicodemus pulled the
trigger on his storm bolter, but no shots were fired.  The magazine
fell out of the bolter and hit the ground.  The sound could not be
heard over the rushing genestealers.  Before Nicodemus had time to
reload, the stealers attacked from both sides.
     Nicodemus channeled his psychic energy into his force aze and
brought it down on a stealer, decapitating it.  He channeled more
energy into it and attacked another stealer.  The stealer managed
to dodge out of the way, but could not counter the attack. 
Nicodemus channeled the last of his psychic energy into a final
blow, and slashed at a stealer.  The stealer dropped, oozing blood
from a huge wound in its side.
     Nicodemus saw more stealers coming down at him through the
corridors.  He backed into a corridor on his left, reloaded his
bolter and set it on overwatch.  He fired at the stealers that were
coming at him.  He shot each one over and over again.  Every
stealer he shot died instantly.  He pressed the trigger until the
magazine was empty.  The stealers kept coming.
     "Get back!" yelled Fabian into his comlink right before he
fired his flamer into the room the stealers were charging at
Nicodemus through, obliterating all of them.  They burst into flame
and fell to the ground.  They tried in vain to reach Nicodemus, who
was just outside the room.
     "That's it!  I'm out of juice!  I'm gonna have to reload! 
Give me a minute!"  Fabian pulled out the empty container of
"Flamer Juice" and dropped it on the floor.  He reached around with
his left hand and pulled another one out of a compartment on his
back.  He popped it into where the old one was.  He connected the
feed tube to the container and was set.
     Stargrod and Kinner were trying to catch up to DaCosta and the
others.  Stargrod turned around to see if there were any stealers
behind them.  A stealer jumped on him, clawing and biting at his
helmet.  The helmet came off.  Stargrod tried to swat at the
stealer with his power glove, but to no avail.  The stealer drew
back a clawed hand.  Stargrod tried to scream, but could not.  He
could only watch in horror as the clawed hand came down upon his
face.
     Kinner heard a crunching and grating sound, like metal on
metal.  He then heard a squishing sound over and over again. 
"Stargrod?" he said as he turned around.  When he turned around, he
saw Stargrod, or at least, what he thought was Stargrod.  All he
saw was a suit of Terminator armour lying on the ground.  He saw a
bloody pulp where Stargrod's face should have been.  Beside the
carnage, Kinner saw a helmet that looked like it had been cut open
by a can opener.  He then saw the stealer hovering over Stargrod,
blood dripping from it's mouth and claws.
     The stealer leapt at Kinner, throwing him to the ground. 
Kinner tried to fight it off, but his arms were pinned by the great
bulk of the stealer.  The stealer started to chew its way through
the helmet.  Kinner could only watch as the saliva of the creature
ran down his visor.  He watched the strong jaws chew up and down. 
He heard the seals on the helmet break.  The helmet came off, and
he was then face to face with his killer.  The stealer opened its
jaws.
     DaCosta heard a blood curdling scream from around the corner. 
"Stargrod!  Kinner!  Sound off!"
     Silence.
     "Stargrod!  Kinner!  Respond!  Where are you!?"
     Silence.
     Nicodemus backed into a junction between two rooms.
     "Relax, Nicodemus.  This is Karell.  I've got your back
covered."
     "I'm going up to the exit.  Cover me."  Iglesias said as he
moved forward.  The stealers went after him, but he kept moving.
     Nicodemus was glad to hear the soothing voice of Karell. 
Nicodemus reloaded his storm bolter again.  He heard the assault
cannon spin to life and pump shots into the disgusting lifeforms. 
By now, they would be dying.
     Karell held the trigger down, continuing to put shots into the
stealers.  Then the bullets stopped coming out of the barrels.  The
ammo counter kept counting, but no shots were firing.
     "She's gonna --- Aaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrgggggghhhh!!"  The assault
cannon jammed and exploded.
     Nicodemus turned as Karell screamed.  He saw the cannon
explode.  It was suddenly very hot.  His armour was melting away. 
"Nnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"  Nicodemus
managed to scream before he died.
     With his cover fire gone, Iglesias knew he couldn't make it. 
He saw blips right before the exit registering on his bio-scanner. 
He was then tackled from behind.  He rolled onto his back to see a
genestealer on top of him.  "Get off me you slimy - Aaaaaarrrgggh!"
     The genestealer had ripped Iglesias's right arm off.  Iglesias
brought up his power glove and crushed the stealer's head.  Another
stealer leaped onto Iglesias, slashing him to pieces.
     Fabian and DaCosta moved into the room where Karell exploded. 
They saw fragments of Karell's armor, as well as Nicodemus's burnt
and mangled force axe.
     "Fabian.  Close up.  Back to back formation.  If they want to
kill us, they're going to have to work for it."
     "Yes sir."
     Fabian saw genestealers pouring into the room.  He fired his
flamer.  Out of six genestealers, five burned to the ground.  The
last one got through the flames to Fabian.  Though it was burning,
the stealer ignored it and attacked.  Fabian raised his power
glove, but not in time.  The stealer slashed through his chest,
nearly cutting him in half.  Fabian only gurgled before he fell to
the ground.
     DaCosta didn't hear Fabian die over the sounds of his storm
bolter and the dying genestealers.  DaCosta heard Lieutenant
Brown's voice over the comlink.  "Turn around!  Turn around!"
     DaCosta turned around to see Fabian lying on the ground,
bleeding all over the floor.  Fabian's helmet had fallen off during
the attack.  Fabian's empty eyes looked at DaCosta with a look of
despair and pain.  He also saw the stealer that killed him.  "Die,
you filthy scum!"  DaCosta drew his power sword just as the stealer
swung at him.  DaCosta couldn't get his sword up in time to block
the blow.  The blow ripped through the armour and into his chest. 
He felt part of his arm ripped away.  He saw his right hand and
storm bolter get tossed away.  He felt the bile rise in his throat. 
The stealer struck him again, this time square in the chest.  The
claws dug into the armour, piercing DaCosta's chest.
     DaCosta opened his mouth and felt blood drip from his mouth
onto the floor.  He fell to his knees, dropping the sword.  The
stealer swung once more, cutting through the armour easily and
cutting into DaCosta's side.  He rolled on his left side.  The
genestealer then slashed deep into DaCosta's face.
     Lieutenant Brown saw the screen that was linked to DaCosta's
camera mount go dark like the other nine.  "They are all gone.  We
will always remember.  Sergeant Lazarus, the reinforcements were
unable to reach you.  Fall back and regroup."

[This article originally appeared in Lucia Chamber's Electronic magazine
Smoke & Mirrors]


Where do I get my Muse? Interesting question, and one I thought I'd be
able to answer easily. When Lucia Chambers asked me to write this
article I never even dreamed that it would remain unwritten til just a
few days before the deadline.

I guess my Muse is hiding.

Where do I get my muse? That's a hard question. It's not like "Where do
you get your socks?" You can answer that one easily enough, and still
have time for brunch. My muse doesn't come often enough for me to know
when she'll be paying her respects again, let alone where she came from
in the first place.

Ah, but when she does come - my muse is most definitely of the female
persuasion - she strikes hard and fast. She hides in many guises,
preferring to offer inspiration when it's least expected. Often, too,
when it's least convenient.

She comes to me in different forms, in different ways, whispering sweet
hints of a long-forgotten song, or dancing across my mind's eye in the
flash of an instant. Unfortunately, she's usually whispering in Greek
and often whilst dancing across my mind's eye, she steps on my nose.

More than once, in a fit of uncontrollable sneezing, I've scared my muse
away. It's just as well, anyway; my Greek phrasebook rarely if ever
is of any help, and by the time I *do* manage to decipher exactly what
it is she's saying, she's off doing other things.

And how do I know that my muse is a she, you might ask? Simple: who else
but a woman could tantalize you by revealing only bits and pieces of
herself, yank it all away in an instant, and leave you wanting for more?
Who else could drive you to stay up half the night putting words to an
electronic screen, just waiting for the ones that work? Indeed, I have
no doubt that my Muse is of the fairer sex. For a final bit of proof, I
offer you this: who but a woman could take you to the edge, make you
think that she's finally come, only to leave you with the knowledge that
it was all a fake?

Talk about my Muse coming when it's least convenient. She just came,
inspiring me to write the chauvinistic, risque' bit of drivel you just
read. But what else can I do? To paraphrase an old saying, "My Muse made
me do it."

Whatever problems she causes - she's caused several near wrecks, for
example, as I searched furtively for a pad and paper and failed to
remember that I was in my car at the time - I wouldn't trade her for
anything. Without her.. I couldn't be me.

But that still doesn't explain where my Muse actually comes from, does
it? I suppose that's because I don't really know. She's told me so many
conflicting stories that I can't even begin to sort out the truth. For
all I know, she really *could* be the reincarnation of Elvis.
Stranger things have happened, for my Muse and me.

                      Chapter 1
                 Mr. Sherlock Holmes

  Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the
mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was
up all night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the
hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left
behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood,
bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a "Penang law-
yer." Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch
across. "To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the
C.C.H.," was engraved upon it, with the date "1884." It was
just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to
carry -- dignified, solid, and reassuring.
  "Well, Watson, what do you make of it?"
  Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him
no sign of my occupation.
  "How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have
eyes in the back of your head."
  "I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in
front of me," said he. "But, tell me, Watson, what do you make
of our visitor's stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to
miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental
souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct
the man by an examination of it."
  "I think," said I, following as far as I could the methods of
my companion, "that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly
medical man, well-esteemed since those who know him give
him this mark of their appreciation."
  "Good!" said Holmes. "Excellent!"
  "I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a
country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on
foot."
  "Why so?"
  "Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one
has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town
practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it
is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it."
  "Perfectly sound!" said Holmes.
  "And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.' I should
guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose
members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and
which has made him a small presentation in return."
  "Really, Watson, you excel yourself," said Holmes, pushing
back his chair and lighting a cigarette. "I am bound to say that
in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my
own small achievements you have habitually underrated your
own abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but
you are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing
genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my
dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt."
  He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his
words gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his
indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had
made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think
that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way
which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands
and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then
with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and
carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a
convex lens.
  "Interesting, though elementary," said he as he returned to
his favourite corner of the settee. "There are certainly one or
two indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several
deductions."
  "Has anything escaped me?" I asked with some self-
importance. "I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I
have overlooked?"
  "I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions
were erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to
be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided
towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this in-
stance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he walks
a good deal."
  "Then I was right."
  "To that extent."
  "But that was all."
  "No, no, my dear Watson, not all -- by no means all. I would
suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more
likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when
the initials 'C.C.' are placed before that hospital the words
'Charing Cross' very naturally suggest themselves."
  "You may be right."
  "The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a
working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our
construction of this unknown visitor."
  "Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does stand for 'Charing
Cross Hospital,' what further inferences may we draw?"
  "Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply
them!"
  "I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has
practised in town before going to the country."
  "I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look
at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable
that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends
unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the
moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the
hospital in order to start in practice for himself. We know there
has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change
from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching
our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the
occasion of the change?"
  "It certainly seems probable."
  "Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the
staff of ohe hospital, since only a man well-established in a
London practice could hold such a position, and such a one
would not drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in
the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a
house-surpeon or a house-physician -- little more than a senior
student. And he left five years ago -- the date is on the stick. So
your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin
air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under
thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor
of a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being
larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff."
  I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his
settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.
  "As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you," said
I, "but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars
about the man's age and professional career." From my small
medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up
the name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who
could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.

      "Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor,
    Devon. House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing
    Cross Hospital. Winner of the Jackson prize for Compara-
    tive Pathology, with essay entitled 'Is Disease a Reversion?'
    Corresponding member of the Swedish Pathological Soci-
    ety. Author of 'Some Freaks of Atavism' (Lancet 1882).
    'Do We Progress?' (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883).
    Medical Officer for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and
    High Barrow."

  "No mention of that local hunt, Watson," said Holmes with a
mischievous smile, "but a country doctor, as you very astutely
observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As
to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable, unambi-
tious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is only an
amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only an
unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,
and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his
visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room."
  "And the dog?"
  "Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his
master. Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the
middle, and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The
dog's jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too
broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a
mastiff. It may have been -- yes, by Jove, it is a curly-haired
spaniel."
  He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted
in the recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction
in his voice that I glanced up in surprise.
  "My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?"
  "For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our
very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don't move, I
beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your
presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic
moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair
which is walking into your life, and you know not whether for
good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science,
ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!"
  The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I
had expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall,
thin man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between
two keen, gray eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly
from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a
professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was
dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was
already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head
and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes
fell upon the stick in Holmes's hand, and he ran towards it with
an exclamation of joy. "I am so very glad," said he. "I was not
sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I would
not lose that stick for the world."
  "A presentation, I see," said Holmes.
  "Yes, sir."
  "From Charing Cross Hospital?"
  "From one or two friends there on the occasion of my
marriage."
  "Dear, dear, that's bad!" said Holmes, shaking his head.
  Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.
  "Why was it bad?"
  "Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your
marriage, you say?"
  "Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all
hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home
of my own."
  "Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all," said
Holmes. "And now, Dr. James Mortimer --"
  "Mister, sir, Mister -- a humble M.R.C.S."
  "And a man of precise mind, evidently."
  "A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on
the shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr.
Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not --"
  "No, this is my friend Dr. Watson."
  "Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in
connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much,
Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or
such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have
any objection to my running my finger along your parietal
fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available,
would be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not
my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your
skull."
  Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. "You
are an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am
in mine," said he. "I observe from your forefinger that you
make your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one."
  The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in
the other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fin-
gers as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect.
  Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me
the interest which he took in our curious companion.
  "I presume, sir," said he at last, "that it was not merely for
the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the
honour to call here last night and again to-day?"
  "No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity
of doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I
recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am
suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary prob-
lem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest expert
in Europe --"
  "Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the
first?" asked Holmes with some asperity.
  "To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Mon-
sieur Bertillon must always appeal strongly."
  "Then had you not better consult him?"
  "I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical
man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust,
sir, that I have not inadvertently --"
  "Just a little," said Holmes. "I think, Dr. Mortimer, you
would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me
plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you
demand my assistance."

                      Chapter 2
           The Curse of the Baskervilles

  "I have in my pocket a manuscript," said Dr. James Mortimer.
  "I observed it as you entered the room," said Holmes.
  "It is an old manuscript."
  "Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery."
  "How can you say that, sir?"
  "You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination
all the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert
who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.
You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the
subject. I put that at 1730."
  "The exact date is 1742." Dr. Mortimer drew it from his
breast-pocket. "This family paper was committed to my care by
Sir Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some
three months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I
may say that I was his personal friend as well as his medical
attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical,
and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document
very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as
did eventually overtake him."
  Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened
it upon his knee.
  "You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s
and the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me
to fix the date."
  I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded
script. At the head was written: "Baskerville Hall," and below
in large, scrawling figures: "1742."
  "It appears to be a statement of some sort."
  "Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the
Baskerville family."
  "But I understand that it is something more modern and
practical upon which you wish to consult me?"
  "Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must
be decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short
and is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission
I will read it to you."
  Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips to-
gether, and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr.
Mortimer turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high,
cracking voice the following curious, old-world narrative:

       "Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there
     have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct line
     from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from my
     father, who also had it from his, I have set it down with all
     belief that it occurred even as is here set forth. And I would
     have you believe, my sons, that the same Justice which
     punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that
     no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may
     be removed. Learn then from this story not to fear the fruits
     of the past, but rather to be circumspect in the future, that
     those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so
     grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.
       "Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the
     history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most
     earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of Basker-
     ville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be gainsaid
     that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man. This, in
     truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing that saints
     have never flourished in those parts, but there was in him a
     certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a by-
     word through the West. It chanced that this Hugo came to
     love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known under so
     bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held lands
     near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden, being
     discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him, for she
     feared his evil name. So it came to pass that one Michaelmas
     this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked compan-
     ions, stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden,
     her father and brothers being from home, as he well knew.
     When they had brought her to the Hall the maiden was
     placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat
     down to a long carouse, as was their nightly custom. Now,
     the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the
     singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to
     her from below, for they say that the words used by Hugo
     Baskerville, when he was in wine, were such as might blast
     the man who said them. At last in the stress of her fear she
     did that which might have daunted the bravest or most
     active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which
     covered (and still covers) the south wall she came down
     from under the eaves, and so homeward across the moor,
     there being three leagues betwixt the Hall and her father's
     farm.
       "It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his
     guests to carry food and drink -- with other worse things,
     perchance -- to his captive, and so found the cage empty and
     the bird escaped. Then, as it would seem, he became as one
     that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the
     dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and
     trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all
     the company that he would that very night render his body
     and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the
     wench. And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of
     the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than
     the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon her
     Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms
     that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and
     giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid's, he swung them
     to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the
     moor.
       "Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable
     to understand all that had been done in such haste. But anon
     their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which
     was like to be done upon the moorlands. Everything was
     now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for
     their horses, and some for another flask of wine. But at
     length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the
     whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started in
     pursuit. The moon shone clear above them, and they rode
     swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must
     needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.
       "They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of
     the night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to
     him to know if he had seen the hunt. And the man, as the
     story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce
     speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen the
     unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track. 'But I
     have seen more than that,' said he, 'for Hugo Baskerville
     passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind
     him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at
     my heels.' So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and
     rode onward. But soon their skins turned cold, for there
     came a galloping across the moor, and the black mare,
     dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing bridle and
     empty saddle. Then the revellers rode close together, for a
     great fear was on them, but they still followed over the
     moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been
     right glad to have turned his horse's head. Riding slowly in
     this fashion they came at last upon the hounds. These,
     though known for their valour and their breed, were whim-
     pering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal, as we
     call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some, with
     starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow
     valley before them.
       "The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as
     you may guess, than when they started. The most of them
     would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest,
     or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the
     goyal. Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two
     of those great stones, still to be seen there, which were set
     by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon
     was shining bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre
     lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and
     of fatigue. But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was
     it that of the body of Hugo Baskerviile lying near her,
     which raised the hair upon the heads of these three dare-
     devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and
     plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great,
     black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound
     that ever mortal eye has rested upon. And even as they
     looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on
     which, as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon
     them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life,
     still screaming, across the moor. One, it is said, died that
     very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were
     but broken men for the rest of their days.
       "Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound
     which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever
     since. If I have set it down it is because that which is clearly
     known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and
     guessed. Nor can it be denied that many of the family have
     been unhappy in their deaths, which have been sudden,
     bloody, and mysterious. Yet may we shelter ourselves in
     the infinite goodness of Providence, which would not for-
     ever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth genera-
     tion which is threatened in Holy Writ. To that Providence,
     my sons, I hereby commend you, and I counsel you by way
     of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark
     hours when the powers of evil are exalted.
       "[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and
     John, with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their
     sister Elizabeth.]"

  When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narra-
tive he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared
across at Mr. Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the
end of his cigarette into the fire.
  "Well?" said he.
  "Do you not find it interesting?"
  "To a collector of fairy tales."
  Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.
  "Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more
recent. This is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this
year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir
Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that date."
  My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became
intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:

       "The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville,
     whose name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal
     candidate for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a
     gloom over the county. Though Sir Charles had resided at
     Baskerville Hall for a comparatively short period his amia-
     bility of character and extreme generosity had won the
     affection and respect of all who had been brought into
     contact with him. In these days of nouveaux riches it is
     refreshing to find a case where the scion of an old county
     family which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his
     own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the
     fallen grandeur of his line. Sir Charles, as is well known,
     made large sums of money in South African speculation.
     More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns
     against them, he realized his gains and returned to England
     with them. It is only two years since he took up his resi-
     dence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how large
     were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which
     have been interrupted by his death. Being himself childless,
     it was his openly expressed desire that the whole country-
     side should, within his own lifetime, profit by his good
     fortune, and many will have personal reasons for bewailing
     his untimely end. His generous donations to local and county
     charities have been frequently chronicled in these columns.
       "The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles
     cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the
     inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of
     those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.
     There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to
     imagine that death could be from any but natural causes. Sir
     Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to have
     been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In spite of
     his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes,
     and bis indoor servants at Baskerville Hall consisted of a mar-
     ried couple named Barrymore, the husband acting as butler
     and the wife as housekeeper. Their evidence, corroborated
     by that of several friends, tends to show that Sir Charles's
     health has for some time been impaired, and points espe-
     cially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in
     changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attacks of ner-
     vous depression. Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medi-
     cal attendant of the deceased, has given evidence to the
     same effect.
       "The facts of the case are simple. Sir Charles Baskerville
     was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking
     down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall. The evi-
     dence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his
     custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his
     intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered
     Barrymore to prepare his luggage. That night he went out as
     usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was
     in the habit of smoking a cigar. He never returned. At
     twelve o'clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open,
     became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search of
     his master. The day had been wet, and Sir Charles's foot-
     marks were easily traced down the alley. Halfway down this
     walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor. There
     were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some little
     time here. He then proceeded down the alley, and it was at
     the far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact
     which has not been explained is the statement of Barrymore
     that his master's footprints altered their character from the
     time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared
     from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes.
     One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no
     great distance at the time, but he appears by his own
     confession to have been the worse for drink. He declares
     that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction
     they came. No signs of violence were to be discovered upon
     Sir Charles's person, and though the doctor's evidence pointed
     to an almost incredible facial distortion -- so great that Dr.
     Mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his
     friend and patient who lay before him -- it was explained
     that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of
     dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaustion. This expla-
     nation was borne out by the post-mortem examination, which
     showed long-standing organic disease, and the coroner's
     jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evi-
     dence. It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the
     utmost importance that Sir Charles's heir should settle at the
     Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly
     interrupted. Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not
     finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been
     whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been
     difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall. It is under-
     stood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville, if he be
     still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville's younger
     brother. The young man when last heard of was in America,
     and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing
     him of his good fortune."

  Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket.
  "Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with
the death of Sir Charles Baskerville."
  "I must thank you," said Sherlock Holmes, "for calling my
attention to a case which certainly presents some features of
interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but
I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican
cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with
several interesting English cases. This article, you say, contains
all the public facts?"
  "It does."
  "Then let me have the private ones." He leaned back, put his
finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial
expression.
  "In doing so," said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show
signs of some strong emotion, "I am telling that which I have
not confided to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the
coroner's inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing
himself in the public position of seeming to indorse a popular
superstition. I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the
paper says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were
done to increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these
reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I
knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with you
there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.
  "The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near
each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw
a good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of
Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist,
there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir
Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought
us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so.
He had brought back much scientific information from South
Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together
discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the
Hottentot.
  "Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to
me that Sir Charles's nervous system was strained to the break-
ing point. He had taken this legend which I have read you
exceedingly to heart -- so much so that, although he would walk
in his own grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon
the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr.
Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung
his family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of
his ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly
presence constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion
he has asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night
ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound.
The latter question he put to me several times, and always with a
voice which vibrated with excitement.
  "I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening
some three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his
hall door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in
front of him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my
shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most
dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just time to catch a
glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf
passing at the head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he
that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal
had been and look around for it. It was gone, however, and the
incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind. I
stayed with him all the evening, and it was on that occasion, to
explain the emotion which he had shown, that he confided to my
keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came. I
mention this small episode because it assumes some importance
in view of the tragedy which followed, but I was convinced at
the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his excite-
ment had no justification.
  "It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to
London. His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxi-
ety in which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might
be, was evidently having a serious effect upon his health. I
thought that a few months among the distractions of town
would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend
who was much concerned at his state of health, was of the same
opinion. At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.
  "On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler
who made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to
me, and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville
Hall within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all
the facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the
footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate
where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the
shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no
other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and
finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched
until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his
fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with
some strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have
sworn to his identity. TheFe was certainly no physical injury of
any kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the
inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round
the body. He did not observe any. But I did -- some little distance
off, but fresh and clear."
  "Footprints?"
  "Footprints. "
  "A man's or a woman's?"
  Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his
voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered:
  "Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!"

                    Chapter 3
                   The Problem

  I confess at these words a shudder passed through me.
There was a thrill in the doctor's voice which showed that he
was himself deeply moved by that which he told us. Holmes
leaned forward in his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry
glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested.
  "You saw this?"
  "As clearly as I see you."
  "And you said nothing?"
  "What was the use?"
  "How was it that no one else saw it?"
  "The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no
one gave them a thought. I don't suppose I should have done so
had I not known this legend."
  "There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?"
  "No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog."
  "You say it was large?"
  "Enormous. "
  "But it had not approached the body?"
  "No."
  "What sort of night was it?'
  "Damp and raw."
  "But not actually raining?"
  "No."
  "What is the alley like?"
  "There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and
  impenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across."
  "Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?"
  "Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either
side."
  "I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by
a gate?"
  "Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor."
  "Is there any other opening?"
  "None."
  "So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it
from the house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?"
  "There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end."
  "Had Sir Charles reached this?"
  "No; he lay about fifty yards from it."
  "Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer -- and this is important -- the
  marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass?"
  "No marks could show on the grass."
  "Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?"
  "Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as
the moor-gate."
  "You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-
gate closed?"
  "Closed and padlocked."
  "How high was it?"
  "About four feet high."
  "Then anyone could have got over it?"
  "Yes."
  "And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?"
  "None in particular."
  "Good heaven! Did no one examine?"
  "Yes, I examined, myself."
  "And found nothing?"
  "It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood
there for five or ten minutes."
  "How do you know that?"
  "Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar."
  "Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart.
But the marks?"
  "He had left his own marks all over that small patch of
gravel. I could discern no others."
  Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an
impatient gesture.
  "If I had only been there!" he cried. "It is evidently a case of
extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportu-
nities to the scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I
might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the
rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants. Oh, Dr.
Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have
called me in! You have indeed much to answer for."
  "I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these
facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not
wishing to do so. Besides, besides --"
  "Why do you hesitate?"
  "There is a realm in which the most acute and most experi-
enced of detectives is helpless."
  "You mean that the thing is supernatural?"
  "I did not positively say so."
  "No, but you evidently think it."
  "Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears
several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled
order of Nature."
  "For example?"
  "I find that before the terrible event occurred several people
had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this
Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal
known to science. They all agreed that it was a huge creature,
luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I have cross-examined these
men, one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and
one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this
dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of
the legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the
district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at
night."
  "And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be super-
natural?"
  "I do not know what to believe."
  Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
   "I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world,"
said he. "In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on
the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a
task. Yet you must admit that the footmark is material."
  "The original hound was material enough to tug a man's
throat out, and yet he was diabolical as well."
  "I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists.
But now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views
why have you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same
breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles's death, and
that you desire me to do it."
  "I did not say that I desired you to do it."
  "Then, how can I assist you?"
  "By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry
Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Station" -- Dr. Mortimer
looked at his watch -- "in exactly one hour and a quarter."
  "He being the heir?"
  "Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young
gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From
the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in
every way. I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee
and executor of Sir Charles's will."
  "There is no other claimant, I presume?"
  "None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to
trace was Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of
whom poor Sir Charles was the elder. The second brother, who
died young, is the father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger,
was the black sheep of the family. He came of the old masterful
Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the
family picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold
him, fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow
fever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five
minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that
he arrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes,
what would you advise me to do with him?"
  "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?"
  "It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every
Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure
that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he
would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old
race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it
cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak
countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which
has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is
no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by
my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring
the case before you and ask for your advice."
  Holmes considered for a little time.
  "Put into plain words, the matter is this," said he. "In your
opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an
unsafe abode for a Baskerville -- that is your opinion?"
  "At least I might go the length of saying that there is some
evidence that this may be so."
  "Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it
could work the young man evil in London as easily as in
Devonshire. A devil with merely local powers like a parish
vestry would be too inconceivable a thing."
  "You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you
would probably do if you were brought into personal contact
with these things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that
the young man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He
comes in fifty minutes. What would you recommend?"
  "I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel
who is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to
meet Sir Henry Baskerville."
  "And then?"
  "And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made
up my mind about the matter."
  "How long will it take you to make up your mind?"
  "Twenty-four hours. At ten o'clock to-morrow, Dr. Morti-
mer, I will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here,
and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will
bring Sir Henry Baskerville with you."
  "I will do so, Mr. Holmes." He scribbled the appointment on
his shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-
minded fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.
  "Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before
Sir Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition
upon the moor?"
  "Three people did."
  "Did any see it after?"
  "I have not heard of any."
  "Thank you. Good-morning."
  Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward
satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.
  "Going out, Watson?"
  "Unless I can help you."
  "No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to
you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points
of view. When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send
up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would
be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before
evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as
to this most interesting problem which has been submined to us
this morning."
  I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my
friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during
which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alter-
native theories, balanced one against the other, and made up his
mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial. I
therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker
Street until evening. It was nearly nine o'clock when I found
myself in the sitting-room once more.
  My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had
broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light
of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered,
however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of
strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me
coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in
his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay
pipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.
  "Caught cold, Watson?" said he.
  "No, it's this poisonous atmosphere."
  "I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it."
  "Thick! It is intolerable."
  "Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day,
I perceive."
  "My dear Holmes!"
  "Am I right?"
  "Certainly, but how?"
  He laughed at my bewildered expression.
  "There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which
makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess
at your expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry
day. He returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on
his hat and his boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He
is not a man with intimate friends. Where, then, could he have
been? Is it not obvious?"
  "Well, it is rather obvious."
  "The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any
chance ever observes. Where do you think that I have been?"
  "A fixture also."
  "On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire."
  "In spirit?"
  "Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I
regret to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of
coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent
down to Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the
moor, and my spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself
that I could find my way about."
  "A large-scale map, I presume?"
  "Very large." He unrolled one section and held it over his
knee. "Here you have the particular district which concerns us.
That is Baskerville Hall in the middle."
  "With a wood round it?"
  "Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that
name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you per-
ceive, upon the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is
the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his
headquarters. Within a radius of five miles there are, as you see,
only a very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which
was mentioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated here
which may be the residence of the naturalist -- Stapleton, if I
remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farm-
houses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the
great convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these
scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is
the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which
we may help to play it again."
  "It must be a wild place."
  "Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to
have a hand in the affairs of men --"
  "Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation."
  "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?
There are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is
whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what
is the crime and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr.
Mortimer's surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with
forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of our
investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses
before falling back upon this one. I think we'll shut that window
again, if you don't mind. It is a singular thing, but I find that a
concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. I have
not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that
is the logical outcome of my convictions. Have you turned the
case over in your mind?"
  "Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the
day."
  "What do you make of it?"
  "It is very bewildering."
  "It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of
distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.
What do you make of that?"
  "Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that
portion of the alley."
  "He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest
Why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?"
  "What then?"
  "He was running, Watson -- running desperately, running for
his life, running until he burst his heart-and fell dead upon his
face."
  "Running from what?"
  "There lies our problem. There are indications that the man
was crazed with fear before ever he began to run."
  "How can you say that?"
  "I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him
across the moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable
only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house
instead of towards it. If the gipsy's evidence may be taken as
true, he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was
least likely to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for that
night, and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather
than in his own house?"
  "You think that he was waiting for someone?"
  "The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his
taking an evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night
inclement. Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten
minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I
should have given him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?"
  "But he went out every evening."
  "I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every
evening. On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the
moor. That night he waited there. It was the night before he
made his departure for London. The thing takes shape, Watson.
It becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and
we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we
have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry
Baskerville in the morning."

                       Chapter 4
                Sir Henry Baskerville

  Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his
dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punc-
tual to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when
Dr. Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet.
The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of
age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong,
pugnacious face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the
weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his
time in the open air, and yet there was something in his steady
eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the
gentleman.
  "This is Sir Henry Baskerville," said Dr. Mortimer.
  "Why, yes," said he, "and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock
Holmes, that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to
you this morning I should have come on my own account. I
understand that you think out little puzzles, and I've had one this
morning which wants more thinking out than I am able to give
it."
  "Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that
you have yourself had some remarkable experience since you
arrived in London?"
  "Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as
like as not. It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which
reached me this morning."
  He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It
was of common quality, grayish in colour. The address, "Sir
Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel," was printed in rough
characters; the post-mark "Charing Cross," and the date of
posting the preceding evening.
  "Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Ho-
tel?" asked Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.
  "No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr.
Mortimer."
  "But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?"
  "No, I had been staying with a friend," said the doctor.
"There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this
hotel."
  "Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your
movements." Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of fools-
cap paper folded into four. This he opened and spread flat upon
the table. Across the middle of it a single sentence had been
formed by the expedient of pasting printed words upon it. It ran:

   As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.

The word "moor" only was printed in ink.
  "Now," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "perhaps you will tell
me, Mr. Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and
who it is that takes so much interest in my affairs?"
  "What do you make of it,  Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that
there is nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?"
  "No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was
convinced that the business is supernatural."
  "What business?" asked Sir Henry sharply. "It seems to me
that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about
my own affairs."
  "You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room,
Sir Henry. I promise you that," said Sherlock Holmes. "We will
confine ourselves for the present with your permission to this
very interesting document, which must have been put together
and posted yesterday evening. Have you yesterday's Times,
Watson?"
  "It is here in the corner."
  "Might I trouble you for it -- the inside page, please, with the
leading articles?" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up
and down the columns. "Capital article this on free trade. Permit
me to give you an extract from it.

      "You may be cajoled into imagining that your own spe-
    cial trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a
    protective tariff, but it stands to reason that such legislation
    must in the long run keep away wealth from the country,
    diminish the value of our imports, and lower the general
    conditions of life in this island.

"What do you think of that, Watson?" cried Holmes in high glee,
rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. "Don't you think
that is an admirable sentiment?"
  Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional
interest, and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark
eyes upon me.
  "I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind,"
said he, "but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as
that note is concerned."
  "On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the
trail, Sir Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods
than you do, but I fear that even he has not quite grasped the
significance of this sentence."
  "No, I confess that I see no connection."
  "And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connec-
tion that the one is extracted out of the other. 'You,' 'your,'
'your,' 'life,' 'reason,' 'value,' 'keep away,' 'from the.' Don't
you see now whence these words have been taken?"
  "By thunder, you're right! Well, if that isn't smart!" cried Sir
Henry.
  "If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that
'keep away' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece."
  "Well, now -- so it is!"
  "Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could
have imagined," said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in
amazement. "I could understand anyone saying that the words
were from a newspaper; but that you should name which, and
add that it came from the leading article, is really one of the
most remarkable things which I have ever known. How did you
do it?"
  "I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro
from that of an Esquimau?"
  "Most certainly."
  "But how?"
  "Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvi-
ous. The supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve,
the --"
  "But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally
obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the
leaded bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of
an evening half-penny paper as there could be between your
negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the
most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in
crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I
confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News.
But a Times leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could
have been taken from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the
strong probability was that we should find the words in yester-
day's issue."
  "So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes," said Sir
Henry Baskerville, "someone cut out this message with a
scissors --"
  "Nail-scissors," said Holmes. "You can see that it was a
very short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips
over 'keep away.' "
  "That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair
of short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste --"
  "Gum," said Holmes.
  "With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word
'moor' should have been written?"
  "Because he could not find it in print. The other words were
all simple and might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be
less common."
  "Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read any-
thing else in this message, Mr. Holmes?"
  "There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains
have been taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe
is printed in rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is
seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated. We
may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an
educated man who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his
effort to conceal his own writing suggests that that writing might
be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you will
observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line,
but that some are much higher than others. 'Life,' for example
is quite out of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or
it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter. On
the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter was
evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such
a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up the
interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any letter
posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he
would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption -- 
and from whom?"
  "We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,"
said Dr. Mortimer.
  "Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities
and choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagina-
tion, but we have always some material basis on which to start
our speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I
am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel."
  "How in the world can you say that?"
  "If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and
the ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered
twice in a single word and has run dry three times in a short
address, showing that there was very little ink in the bottle.
Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such
a state, and the combination of the two must be quite rare. But
you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get
anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that
could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around
Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times
leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent
this singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What's this?"
  He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the
words were pasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.
  "Well?"
  "Nothing," said he, throwing it down. "It is a blank half-
sheet of paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we
have drawn as much as we can from this curious letter; and now,
Sir Henry, has anything else of interest happened to you since
you have been in London?"
  "Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not."
  "You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?"
  "I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,"
said our visitor. "Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch
me?"
  "We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us
before we go into this matter?"
  "Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting."
  "I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth
reporting."
  Sir Henry smiled.
  "I don't know much of British life yet, for I have spent nearly
all my time in the States and in Canada. But I hope that to lose
one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over
here."
  "You have lost one of your boots?"
  "My dear sir," cried Dr. Mortimer, "it is only mislaid. You
will find it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of
troubling Mr. Holmes with trifles of this kind?"
  "Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine."
  "Exactly," said Holmes, "however foolish the incident may
seem. You have lost one of your boots, you say?"
  "Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door
last night, and there was only one in the morning. I could get no
sense out of the chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I
only bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never
had them on."
  "If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to
be cleaned?"
  "They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was
why I put them out."
  "Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday
you went out at once and bought a pair of boots?"
  "I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round
with me. You see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress
the part, and it may be that I have got a little careless in my ways
out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots -- gave
six dollars for them -- and had one stolen before ever I had them
on my feet."
  "It seems a singularly useless thing to steal," said Sherlock
Holmes. "I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that it will
not be long before the missing boot is found."
  "And, now, gentlemen," said the baronet with decision, "it
seems to me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that
I know. It is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full
account of what we are all driving at."
  "Your request is a very reasonable one," Holmes answered.
"Dr. Mortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your
story as you told it to us."
  Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from
his pocket and presented the whole case as he had done upon the
morning before. Sir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest
attention and with an occasional exclamation of surprise.
  "Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a ven-
geance," said he when the long narrative was finished. "Of
course, I've heard of the hound ever since I was in the nursery.
It's the pet story of the family, though I never thought of taking
it seriously before. But as to my uncle's death -- well, it all
seems boiling up in my head, and I can't get it clear yet. You
don't seem quite to have made up your mind whether it's a case
for a policeman or a clergyman."
  "Precisely."
  "And now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I
suppose that fits into its place."
  "It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about
what goes on upon the moor," said Dr. Mortimer.
  "And also," said Holmes, "that someone is not ill-disposed
towards you, since they warn you of danger."
  "Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare
me away."
  "Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much
indebted to you, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem
which presents several interesting alternatives. But the practical
point which we now have to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or
is not advisable for you to go to Baskerville Hall."
  "Why should I not go?"
  "There seems to be danger."
  "Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean
danger from human beings?"
  "Well, that is what we have to find out."
  "Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in
hell, Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can
prevent me from going to the home of my own people, and you
may take that to be my final answer." His dark brows knitted
and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke. It was evident
that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct in this
their last representative. "Meanwhile," said he, "I have hardly
had time to think over all that you have told me. It's a big thing
for a man to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I
should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind.
Now, look here, Mr. Holmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am
going back right away to my hotel.- Suppose you and your friend,
Dr. Watson, come round and lunch with us at two. I'll be able to
tell you more clearly then how this thing strikes me."
  "Is that convenient to you, Watson?"
  "Perfectly."
  "Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?"
  "I'd prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather."
  "I'll join you in a walk, with pleasure," said his companion.
  "Then we meet again at two o'clock. Au revoir, and good-
morning!"
  We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the
bang of the front door. In an instant Holmes had changed from
the languid dreamer to the man of action.
  "Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!"
He rushed into his room in his dressing-gown and was back
again in a few seconds in a frock-coat. We hurried together down
the stairs and into the street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were
still visible about two hundred yards ahead of us in the direction
of Oxford Street.
  "Shall I run on and stop them?"
  "Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied
with your company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are
wise, for it is certainly a very fine morning for a walk."
  He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance
which divided us by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred
yards behind, we followed into Oxford Street and so down
Regent Street. Once our friends stopped and stared into a shop
window, upon which Holmes did the same. An instant after-
wards he gave a little cry of satisfaction, and, following the
direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with a man
inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now
proceeding slowly onward again.
  "There's our man, Watson! Come along! We'll have a good
look at him, if we can do no more."
  At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair
of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the
cab. Instantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was
screamed to the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent
Street. Holmes looked eagerly round for another, but no-empty
one was in sight. Then he dashed in wild pursuit amid the stream
of the traffic, but the start was too great, and already the cab was
out of sight.
  "There now!" said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and
white with vexation from the tide of vehicles. "Was ever such
bad luck and such bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if
you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against
my successes!"
  "Who was the man?"
  "I have not an idea."
  "A spy?"
  "Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Basker-
ville has been very closely shadowed by someone since he has
been in town. How else could it be known so quickly that it was
the Northumberland Hotel which he had chosen? If they had
followed him the first day I argued that they would follow him
also the second. You may have observed that I twice strolled
over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend."
  "Yes, I remember."
  "I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none.
We are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very
deep, and though I have not finally made up my mind whether it
is a benevolent or a malevolent agency which is in touch with us,
I am conscious always of power and design. When our friends
left I at once followed them in the hopes of marking down their
invisible attendant. So wily was he that he had not trusted
himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab so that he
could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their notice.
His method had the additional advantage that if they were to take
a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one
obvious disadvantage."
  "It puts him in the power of the cabman."
  "Exactly."
  "What a pity we did not get the number!"
  "My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not
seriously imagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704
is our man. But that is no use to us for the moment."
  "I fail to see how you could have done more."
  "On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and
walked in the other direction. I should then at my leisure have
hired a second cab and followed the first at a respectful distance,
or, better still, have driven to the Northumberland Hotel and
waited there. When our unknown had followed Baskerville home
we should have had the opportunity of playing his own game
upon himself and seeing where he made for. As it is, by an
indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with extraor-
dinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed
ourselves and lost our man."
  We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this
conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long
vanished in front of us.
  "There is no object in our following them," said Holmes.
"The shadow has departed and will not return. We must see
what further cards we have in our hands and play them with
decision. Could you swear to that man's face within the cab?"
  "I could swear only to the beard."
  "And so could I -- from which I gather that in all probability it
was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no
use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here,
Watson!"
  He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he
was warmly greeted by the manager.
  "Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in
which I had the good fortune to help you?"
  "No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and
perhaps my life."
  "My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection,
Wilson, that you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright,
who showed some ability during the investigation."
  "Yes, sir, he is still with us."
  "Could you ring him up? -- thank you! And I should be glad to
have change of this five-pound note."
  A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the
summons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great
reverence at the famous detective.
  "Let me have the Hotel Directory," said Holmes. "Thank
you! Now, Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three
hotels here, all in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing
Cross. Do you see?"
  "Yes, sir."
  "You will visit each of these in turn."
  "Yes, sir."
  "You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one
shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings."
  "Yes, sir."
  "You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of
yesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscar-
ried and that you are looking for it. You understand?"
  "Yes, sir."
  "But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the
Times with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy of
the Times. It is this page. You could easily recognize it, could
you not?"
  "Yes, sir."
  "In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter,
to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three
shillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of the
twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned or
removed. In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of
paper and you will look for this page of the Times among it. The
odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten
shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by
wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only
remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman,
No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street
picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the
hotel."

                       Chapter 5
                 Three Broken Threads

  Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power
of detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business
in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he
was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian
masters. He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the
crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found our-
selves at the Northumberland Hotel.
  "Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you," said the
clerk. "He asked me to show you up at once when you came."
  "Have you any objection to my looking at your register?"
said Holmes.
  "Not in the least."
  The book showed that two names had been added after that of
Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of New-
castle; the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.
  "Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to
know," said Holmes to the porter. "A lawyer, is he not, gray-
headed, and walks with a limp?"
  "No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active
gentleman, not older than yourself."
  "Surely you are mistaken about his trade?"
  "No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very
well known to us."
  "Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember
the name. Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one
friend one finds another."
  "She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of
Gloucester. She always comes to us when she is in town."
  "Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We
have established a most important fact by these questions, Wat-
son," he continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together.
"We know now that the people who are so interested in our
friend have not settled down in his own hotel. That means that
while they are, as we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they
are equally anxious that he should not see them. Now, this is a
most suggestive fact."
  "What does it suggest?"
  "It suggests -- halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the
matter?"
  As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against
Sir Henry Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger,
and he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious
was he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it
was in a much broader and more Western dialect than any which
we had heard from him in the morning.
  "Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,"
he cried. "They'll find they've stafted in to monkey with the
wrong man unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can't
find my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with
the best, Mr. Holmes, but they've got a bit over the mark this
time."
  "Still looking for your boot?"
  "Yes, sir, and mean to find it."
  "But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?"
  "So it was, sir. And now it's an old black one."
  "What! you don't mean to say ?"
  "That's just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in
the world -- the new brown, the old black, and the patent leath-
ers, which I am wearing. Last night they took one of my brown
ones, and to-day they have sneaked one of the black. Well, have
you got it? Speak out, man, and don't stand staring!"
  An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.
  "No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear
no word of it."
  "Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I'll see
the manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this
hotel."
  "It shall be found, sir -- I promise you that if you will have a
little patience it will be found."
  "Mind it is, for it's the last thing of mine that I'll lose in this
den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you'll excuse my
troubling you about such a trifle --"
  "I think it's well worth troubling about."
  "Why, you look very serious over it."
  "How do you explain it?"
  "I just don't attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest,
queerest thing that ever happened to me."
  "The queerest perhaps --" said Holmes thoughtfully.
  "What do you make of it yourself?"
  "Well, I don't profess to understand it yet. This case of yours
is very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with
your uncle's death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases
of capital importance which I have handled there is one which
cuts so deep. But we hold several threads in our hands, and the
odds are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. We may
waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we
must come upon the right."
  We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the
business which had brought us together. It was in the private
sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked
Baskerville what were his intentions.
  "To go to Baskerville Hall."
  "And when?"
  "At the end of the week."
  "On the whole," said Holmes, "I think that your decision is a
wise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in
London, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult to
discover who these people are or what their object can be. If
their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we
should be powerless to prevent it. You did not know, Dr.
Moftimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?"
  Dr. Mortimer started violently.
  "Followed! By whom?"
  "That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you
among your neighbours or acquaintances on Daftmoor any man
with a black, full beard?"
  "No -- or, let me see -- why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles's
butler, is a man with a full, black beard."
  "Ha! Where is Baffymore?"
  "He is in charge of the Hall."
  "We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any
possibility he might be in London."
  "How can you do that?"
  "Give me a telegraph form. 'Is all ready for Sir Henry?' That
will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is
the nearest telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send
a second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: 'Telegram to Mr.
Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, please
return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.'
That should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at
his post in Devonshire or not."
  "That's so," said Baskerville. "By the way, Dr. Mortimer,
who is this Barrymore, anyhow?"
  "He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have
looked after the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know,
he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the
county."
  "At the same time," said Baskerville, "it's clear enough that
so long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people
have a mighty fine home and nothing to do."
  "That is true."
  "Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles's will?" asked
Holmes.
  "He and his wife had five hundred pounds each."
  "Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?"
  "Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provi-
sions of his wlll."
  "That is very interesting."
  "I hope," said Dr. Mortimer, "that you do not look with
suspicious eyes upon everyone who received a legacy from Sir
Charles, for I also had a thousand pounds left to me."
  "Indeed! And anyone else?"
  "There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a
large number of public charities. The residue all went to Sir
Henry."
  "And how much was the residue?"
  "Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds."
  Holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. "I had no idea that so
gigantic a sum was involved," said he.
  "Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not
know how very rich he was until we came to examine his
securities. The total value of the estate was close on to a million."
  "Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a
desperate game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Suppos-
ing that anything happened to our young friend here -- you will
forgive the unpleasant hypothesis! -- who would inherit the estate?"
  "Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother
died unmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who
are distant cousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in
Westmoreland."
  "Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you
met Mr. James Desmond?"
  "Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of
venerable appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he
refused to accept any settlement from Sir Charles, though he
pressed it upon him."
  "And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir
Charles's thousands."
  "He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed.
He would also be the heir to the money unless it were willed
otherwise by the present owner, who can, of course, do what he
likes with it."
  "And have you made your will, Sir Henry?"
  "No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I've had no time, for it was
only yesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case
I feel that the money should go with the title and estate. That
was my poor uncle's idea. How is the owner going to restore the
glories of the Baskervilles if he has not money enough to keep
up the property? House, land, and dollars must go together."
  "Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to
the advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay.
There is only one provision which I must make. You certainly
must not go alone."
  "Dr. Mortimer returns with me."
  "But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house
is miles away from yours. With all the good will in the world he
may be unable to help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with
you someone, a trusty man, who will be always by your side."
  "Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?"
  "If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present
in person; but you can understand that, with my extensive con-
sulting practice and with the constant appeals which reach me
from many quarters, it is impossible for me to be absent from
London for an indefinite time. At the present instant one of the
most revered names in England is being besmirched by a black-
mailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal. You will see
how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor."
  "Whom would you recommend, then?"
  Holmes laid his hand upon my arm.
  "If my friend would undertake it there is no man who is better
worth having at your side when you are in a tight place. No one
can say so more confidently than I."
  The proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I
had time to answer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and
wrung it heartily.
  "Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson," said he.
"You see how it is with me, and you know just as much about
the matter as I do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and
see me through I'll never forget it."
  The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me,
and I was complimented by the words of Holmes and by the
eagerness with which the baronet hailed me as a companion.
  "I will come, with pleasure," said I. "I do not know how I
could employ my time better."
  "And you will report very carefully to me," said Holmes.
"When a crisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall
act. I suppose that by Saturday all might be ready?"
  "Would that suit Dr. Watson?"
  "Perfectly."
  "Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall
meet at the ten-thirty train from Paddington."
  We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph,
and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown
boot from under a cabinet.
  "My missing boot!" he cried.
  "May all our difficulties vanish as easily!" said Sherlock
Holmes.
  "But it is a very, singular thing," Dr. Mortimer remarked. "I
searched this room carefully before lunch."
  "And so did I," said Baskerville. "Every, inch of it."
  "There was certainly no boot in it then."
  "In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we
were lunching."
  The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the
matter, nor could any inquiry, clear it up. Another item had been
added to that constant and apparently purposeless series of small
mysteries which had succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting
aside the whole grim story, of Sir Charles's death, we had a line
of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days, which
included the receipt of the printed letter, the black-bearded spy in
the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot, the loss of the old
black boot, and now the return of the new brown boot. Holmes
sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker Street, and I
knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind, like my
own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into
which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes
could be fitted. All afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost
in tobacco and thought.
  Just before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:

      Have just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall.
                                        BASKERVILLE.

The second:

      Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to report
    unable to trace cut sheet of Times.
                            CARTWRlGHT.

  "There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more
stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. We
must cast round for another scent."
  "We have still the cabman who drove the spy."
  "Exactly. I haw wired to get his name and address from the
Official Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an
answer to my question."
  The ring at the bell proved to be something even more satis-
factory than an answer, however, for the door opened and a
rough-looking fellow entered who was evidently the man himself.
  "I got a message from the head office that a gent at this
address had been inquiring for No. 2704," said he. "I've driven
my cab this seven years and never a word of complaint. I came
here straight from the Yard to ask you to your face what you had
against me."
  "I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,"
said Holmes. "On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you
if you will give me a clear answer to my questions."
  "Well, I've had a good day and no mistake," said the cabman
with a grin. "What was it you wanted to ask, sir?"
  "First of all your name and address, in case I want you
again."
  "John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out
of Shipley's Yard, near Waterloo Station."
  Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.
  "Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and
watched this house at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards
followed the two gentlemen down Regent Street."
  The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. "Why
there's no good my telling you things, for you seem to know as
much as I do already," said he. "The truth is that the gentleman
told me that he was a detective and that I was to say nothing
about him to anyone."
  "My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you
may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide
anything from me. You say that your fare told you that he was a
detective?"
  "Yes, he did."
  "When did he say this?"
  "When he left me."
  "Did he say anything more?"
  "He mentioned his name."
  Holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. "Oh, he men-
tioned his name, did he? That was imprudent. What was the
name that he mentioned?"
  "His name," said the cabman, "was Mr. Sherlock Holmes."
  Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback
than by the cabman's reply. For an instant he sat in silent
amazement. Then he burst into a hearty laugh.
  "A touch, Watson -- an undeniable touch!" said he. "I feel a
foil as quick and supple as my own. He got home upon me very
prettily that time. So his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?"
  "Yes, sir, that was the gentleman's name."
  "Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that
occurred."
  "He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said
that he was a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would
do exactly what he wanted all day and ask no questions. I was
glad enough to agree. First we drove down to the Northumberland
Hotel and waited there until two gentlemen came out and took a
cab from the rank. We followed their cab until it pulled up
somewhere near here."
  "This very door," said Holmes.
  "Well, I couldn't be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew
all about it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an
hour and a half. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and
we followed down Baker Street and along --"
  "I know," said Holmes.
  "Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my
gentleman threw up the trap, and he cried that I should drive
right away to Waterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped
up the mare and we were there under the ten minutes. Then he
paid up his two guineas, like a good one, and away he went into
the station. Only just as he was leaving he turned round and he
said: 'It might interest you to know that you have been driving
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.' That's how I come to know the name."
  "I see. And you saw no more of him?"
  "Not after he went into the station."
  "And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?"
  The cabman scratched his head. "Well, he wasn't altogether
such an easy gentleman to describe. I'd put him at forty years of
age, and he was of a middle height, two or three inches shorter
than you, sir. He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black
beard, cut square at the end, and a pale face. I don't know as I
could say more than that."
  "Colour of his eyes?"
  "No, I can't say that."
  "Nothing more that you can remember?"
  "No, sir; nothing."
  "Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There's another one
waiting for you if you can bring any more information.
Good-night!"
  "Good-night, sir, and thank you!"
  John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me
with a shrug of his shoulders and a rueful smile.
  "Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,"
said he. "The cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that
Sir Henry Baskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in
Regent Street, conjectured that I had got the number of the cab
and would lay my hands on the driver, and so sent back this
audacious message. I tell you, Watson, this time we have got a
foeman who is worthy of our steel. I've been checkmated in
London. I can only wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I'm
not easy in my mind about it."
  "About what?"
  "About sending you. It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly
dangerous business, and the more I see of it the less I like it. Yes
my dear fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I
shall be very glad to have you back safe and sound in Baker
Street once more."

                          Chapter 6
                       Baskerville Hall

  Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon
the appointed day, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr.
Sherlock Holmes drove with me to the station and gave me his
last parting injunctions and advice.
  "I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspi-
cions, Watson," said he; "I wish you simply to report facts in
the fullest possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do
the theorizing."
  "What sort of facts?" I asked.
  "Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indi-
rect upon the case, and especially the relations between young
Baskerville and his neighbours or any fresh particulars concern-
ing the death of Sir Charles. I have made some inquiries myself
in the last few days, but the results have, I fear, been negative.
One thing only appears to be certain, and that is that Mr. James
Desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly gentleman of a very
amiable disposition, so that this persecution does not arise from
him. I really think that we may eliminate him entirely from our
calculations. There remain the people who will actually surround
Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor."
  "Would it not be well in the first place to get rid ofl this
Barrymore couple?"
  "By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they
are innocent it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty
we should be giving up all chance of bringing it home to them.
No, no, we will preserve them upon our list of suspects. Then
there is a groom at the Hall, if I remember right. There are two
moorland farmers. There is our friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I
believe to be entirely honest, and there is his wife, of whom we
know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton, and there is his
sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions. There is Mr.
Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor. and
there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who
must be your very special study."
  "I will do my best."
  "You have arms, I suppose?"
  "Yes, I thought it as well to take them."
  "Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day,
and never relax your precautions."
  Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were
waiting for us upon the platform.
  "No, we have no news of any kind," said Dr. Mortimer in
answer to my friend's questions. "I can swear to one thing, and
that is that we have not been shadowed during the last two days.
We have never gone out without keeping a sharp watch, and no
one could have escaped our notice."
  "You have always kept together, I presume?"
  "Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to
pure amusement when I come to town, so I spent it at the
Museum of the College of Surgeons."
  "And I went to look at the folk in the park," said Baskerville.
"But we had no trouble of any kind."
  "It was imprudent, all the same," said Holmes, shaking his
head and looking very grave. "I beg, Sir Henry, that you will
not go about alone. Some great misfortune will befall you if you
do. Did you get your other boot?"
  "No, sir, it is gone forever."
  "Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye," he added
as the train began to glide down the platform. "Bear in mind, Sir
Henry, one of the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr.
Mortimer has read to us and avoid the moor in those hours of
darkness when the powers of evil are exalted."
  I looked back at the plafform when we had left it far behind
and saw the tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless
and gazing after us.
  The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in
making the more intimate acquaintance of my two companions
and in playing with Dr. Mortimer's spaniel. In a very few hours
the brown earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to
granite, and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields where the
lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer, if a
damper, climate. Young Baskerville stared eagerly out of the
window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized the famil-
ar features of the Devon scenery.
  "I've been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr.
Watson," said he; "but I have never seen a place to compare
with it."
  "l never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his
county," I remarked.
  "It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the
county," said Dr. Mortimer. "A glance at our friend here
reveals the rounded head of the Celt, which carries inside it the
Celtic enthusiasm and power of attachment. Poor Sir Charles's
head was of a very rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in its
characteristics. But you were very young when you last saw
Baskerville Hall, were you not?"
  "I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father's death and
had never seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the
South Coast. Thence I went straight to a friend in America. I tell
you it is all as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I'm as keen
as possible to see the moor."
  "Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your
first sight of the moor," said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the
carriage window.
  Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a
wood there rose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a
strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some
fantastic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long time
his eyes fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much
it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the men
of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep.
There he sat, with his tweed suit and his American accent, in the
corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as I looked at his
dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a
descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and
masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his
thick brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If on
that forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie
before us, this was at least a comrade for whom one might
venture to take a risk with the certainty that he would bravely
share it.
  The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all
descended. Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette
with a pair of cobs was waiting. Our coming was evidently a
great event, for station-master and porters clustered round us to
carry out our luggage. It was a sweet, simple country spot, but I
was surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two sol-
dierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their short rifles
and glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a hard-
faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in
a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white
road. Rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us,
and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green
foliage, but behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose
ever, dark against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the
moor, broken by the jagged and sinister hills.
  The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved
upward through deep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high
banks on either side, heavy with dripping moss and fleshy
hart's-tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble gleamed
in the light of the sinking sun. Still steadily rising, we passed
over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy stream which
gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray boul-
ders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense
with scrub oak and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an excla-
mation of delight, looking eagerly about him and asking count-
less questions. To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a
tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside, which bore so
clearly the mark of the waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the
lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our
wheels died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation --
sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the
carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.
  "Halloa!" cried Dr. Mortimer, "what is this?"
  A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the
moor, lay in front of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an
equestrian statue upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark
and stern, his rifle poised ready over his forearm. He was
watching the road along which we travelled.
  "What is this, Perkins?" asked Dr. Mortimer.
  Our driver half turned in his seat.
  "There's a convict escaped from Princetown, sir. He's been
out three days now, and the warders watch every road and every
station, but they've had no sight of him yet. The farmers about
here don't like it, sir, and that's a fact."
  "Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give
information."
  "Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing
compared to the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it
isn't like any ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick at
nothing."
  "Who is he, then?"
  "It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer."
  I remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes
had taken an interest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the
crime and the wanton brutality which had marked all the actions
of the assassin. The commutation of his death sentence had been
due to some doubts as to his complete sanity, so atrocious was
his conduct. Our wagonette had topped a rise and in front of us
rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled with gnarled and
craggy caims and tors. A cold wind swept down from it and set
us shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was
lurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast,
his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had
cast him out. It needed but this to complete the grim suggestive-
ness of the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky.
Even Baskerville fell silent and pulled his overcoat more closely
around him.
  We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We
looked back on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the
streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new
turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands. The
road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and
olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now and then we
passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone, with
no creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down
into a cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and fus
which had been twisted and bent by the fury of years of storm.
Two high, narrow towers rose over the trees. The driver pointed
with his whip.
  "Baskerville Hall," said he.
  Its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and
shining eyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-
gates, a maze of fantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-
bitten pillars on either side, blotched with lichens, and summounted
by the boars' heads of the Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of
black granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a new
building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles's South
African gold.
  Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the
wheels were again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot
their branches in a sombre tunnel.over our heads. Baskerville
shuddered as he looked up the long, dark drive to where the
house glimmered like a ghost at the farther end.
  "Was it here?" he asked in a low voice.
  "No, no, the yew alley is on the other side."
  The young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.
  "It's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on
him in such a place as this," said he. "It's enough to scare any
man. I'll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six
months, and you won't know it again, with a thousand candle-
power Swan and Edison right here in front of the hall door."
  The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house
lay before us. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a
heavy block of building from which a porch projected. The
whole front was draped in ivy, with a patch clipped bare here
and there where a window or a coat of arms broke through the
dark veil. From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient,
crenellated, and pierced with many loopholes. To right and left
of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite. A dull
light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the
high chimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there
sprang a single black column of smoke.
  "Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!"
  A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open
the door of the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouet-
ted against the yellow light of the hall. She came out and helped
the man to hand down our bags.
  "You don't mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?" said
Dr. Mortimer. "My wife is expecting me."
  "Surely you will stay and have some dinner?"
  "No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me.
I would stay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be
a better guide than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day
to send for me if I can be of service."
  The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I
turned into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It
was a fine apartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty,
and heavily raftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In
the great old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a
log-fire crackled and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our
hands to it, for we were numb from our long drive. Then we
gazed round us at the high, thin window of old stained glass, the
oak panelling, the stags' heads, the coats of arms upon the walls,
all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the central lamp.
  "It's just as I imagined it," said Sir Henry. "Is it not the very
picture of an old family home? To think that this should be the
same hall in which for five hundred years my people have lived.
It strikes me solemn to think of it."
  I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed
about him. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long
shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy
above him. Barrymore had returned from taking our luggage to
our rooms. He stood in front of us now with the subdued manner
of a well-trained servant. He was a remarkable-looking man,
tall, handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished
features.
  "Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?"
  "Is it ready?"
  "In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your
rooms. My wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you
until you have made your fresh arrangements, but you will
understand that under the new conditions this house will require
a considerable staff."
  "What new conditions?"
  "I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and
we were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish
to have more company, and so you will need changes in your
household."
  "Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?"
  "Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir."
  "But your family have been with us for several generations,
have they not? I should be sorry to begin my life here by
breaking an old family connection."
  I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler's
white face.
  "I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the truth,
sir, we were both very much attached to Sir Charles and his
death gave us a shock and made these surroundings very painful
to us. I fear that we shall never again be easy in our minds at
Baskerville Hall."
  "But what do you intend to do?"
  "I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing
ourselves in some business. Sir Charles's generosity has given us
the means to do so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you
to your rooms."
  A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,
approached by a double stair. From this central point two long
corridors extended the whole length of the building, from which
all the bedrooms opened. My own was in the same wing as
Baskerville's and almost next door to it. These rooms appeared
to be much more modern than the central part of the house, and
the bright paper and numerous candles did something to remove
the sombre impression which our arrival had left upon my mind.
  But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place
of shadow and gloom. It was a long chamber with a step
separating the dais where the family sat from the lower portion
reserved for their dependents. At one end a minstrel's gallery
overlooked it. Black beams shot across above our heads, with a
smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. With rows of flaring torches
to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of an old-time
banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two black-
clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a
shaded lamp, one's voice became hushed and one's spirit sub-
dued. A dim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the
Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Regency, stared down upon
us and daunted us by their silent company. We talked little, and I
for one was glad when the meal was over and we were able to
retire into the modern billiard-room and smoke a cigarette.
  "My word, it isn't a very cheerful place," said Sir Henry. "I
suppose one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the
picture at present. I don't wonder that my uncle got a little
jumpy if he lived all alone in such a house as this. However, if it
suits you, we will retire early to-night, and perhaps things may
seem more cheerful in the morning."
  I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out
from my window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in
front of the hall door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and
swung in a rising wind. A half moon broke through the rifts of
racing clouds. In its cold light I saw beyond the trees a broken
fringe of rocks, and the long, low curve of the melancholy moor.
I closed the curtain, feeling that my last impression was in
keeping with the rest.
  And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet
wakeful, tossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the
sleep which would not come. Far away a chiming clock struck
out the quarters of the hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay
upon the old house. And then suddenly, in the very dead of the
night, there came a sound to my ears, clear, resonant, and
unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling
gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow. I sat up in
bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been far
away and was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited
with every nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save
the chiming clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.

                        Chapter 7
              The Stapletons of Merripit House

  The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to
efface from our minds the grim and gray impression which had
been left upon both of us by our first experience of Baskerville
Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flooded in
through the high mullioned windows, throwing watery patches of
colour from the coats of arms which covered them. The dark
panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it was hard
to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck such
a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.
  "I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to
blame!" said the baronet. "We were tired with our journey and
chilled by our drive, so we took a gray view of the place. Now
we are fresh and well, so it is all cheerful once more."
  "And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination," I
answered. "Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a
woman I think, sobbing in the night?"
  "That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I
heard something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was
no more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream."
  "I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob
of a woman."
  "We must ask about this right away." He rang the bell and
asked Barrymore whether he could account for our experience. It
seemed to me that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade
paler still as he listened to his master's question.
  "There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry," he
answered. "One is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other
wing. The other is my wife, and I can answer for it that the
sound could not have come from her."
  And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after breakfast I
met Mrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon
her face. She was a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman
with a stern set expression of mouth. But her telltale eyes were
red and glanced at me from between swollen lids. It was she,
then, who wept in the night, and if she did so her husband must
know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery in
declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did
she weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome,
black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mys-
tery and of gloom. It was he who had been the first to discover
the body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the
circumstances which led up to the old man's death. Was it
possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had seen in
the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the
same. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but
such an impression might easily have been erroneous. How could
I settle the point forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to
see the Grimpen postmaster and find whether the test telegram
had really been placed in Barrymore's own hands. Be the answer
what it might, I should at least have something to report to
Sherlock Holmes.
  Sir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so
that the time was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant
walk of four miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last
to a small gray hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which
proved to be the inn and the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high
above the rest. The postmaster, who was also the village grocer,
had a clear recollection of the telegram.
  "Certainly, sir," said he, "I had the telegram delivered to
Mr. Barrymore exactly as directed."
  "Who delivered it?"
  "My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr.
Barrymore at the Hall last week, did you not?"
  "Yes, father, I delivered it."
  "Into his own hands?" I asked.
  "Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not
put it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore's
hands, and she promised to deliver it at once."
  "Did you see Mr. Barrymore?"
  "No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft."
  "If you didn't see him, how do you know he was in the loft?"
  "Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is," said
the postmaster testily. "Didn't he get the telegram? If there is
any mistake it is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain."
  It seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was
clear that in spite of Holmes's ruse we had no proof that Barry-
more had not been in London all the time. Suppose that it were
so -- suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen
Sir Charles alive, and the first to dog the new heir when he
returned to England. What then? Was he the agent of others or
had he some sinister design of his own? What interest could he
have in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the
strange warning clipped out of the leading article of the Times.
Was that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who
was bent upon counteracting his schemes? The only conceivable
motive was that which had been suggested by Sir Henry, that if
the family could be scared away a comfortable and permanent
home would be secured for the Barrymores. But surely such an
explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the
deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an
invisible net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said
that no more complex case had come to him in all the long series
of his sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back
along the gray, lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed
from his preoccupations and able to come down to take this
heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders.
  Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of run-
ning feet behind me and by a voice which called me by name. I
turned, expecting to see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was
a stranger who was pursuing me. He was a small, slim, clean-
shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired and leanjawed, between
thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray suit and wearing a
straw hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his
shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands.
  "You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,"
said he as he came panting up to where I stood. "Here on the
moor we are homely folk and do not wait for formal introduc-
tions. You may possibly have heard my name from our mutual
friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, of Merripit House."
  "Your net and box would have told me as much," said I,
"for I knew that Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you
know me?"
  "I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to
me from the window of his surgery as you passed. As our road
lay the same way I thought that I would overtake you and
introduce myself. I trust that Sir Henry is none the worse for his
journey?"
  "He is very well, thank you."
  "We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir
Charles the new baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking
much of a wealthy man to come down and bury himself in a
place of this kind, but I need not tell you that it means a very
great deal to the countryside. Sir Henry has, I suppose, no
superstitious fears in the matter?"
  "I do not think that it is likely."
  "Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which
haunts the family?"
  "I have heard it."
  "It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about
here! Any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen
such a creature upon the moor." He spoke with a smile, but I
seemed to read in his eyes that he took the matter more seri-
ously. "The story took a great hold upon the imagination of Sir
Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to his tragic end."
  "But how?"
  "His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any
dog might have had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy
that he really did see something of the kind upon that last night
in the yew alley. I feared that some disaster might occur, for I
was very fond of the old man, and I knew that his heart was
weak."
  "How did you know that?"
  "My friend Mortimer told me."
  "You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that
he died of fright in consequence?"
  "Have you any better explanation?"
  "I have not come to any conclusion."
  "Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?"
  The words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at
the placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that
no surprise was intended.
  "It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr
Watson," said he. "The records of your detective have reached
us here, and you could not celebrate him without being known
yourself. When Mortimer told me your name he could not deny
your identity. If you are here, then it follows that Mr. Sherlock
Holmes is interesting himself in the matter, and I am naturally
curious to know what view he may take."
  "I am afraid that I cannot answer that question."
  "May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himsel?"
  "He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which
engage his attention."
  "What a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so
dark to us. But as to your own researches, if there is any possible
way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will
command me. If I had any indication of the nature of your
suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, I might
perhaps even now give you some aid or advice."
  "I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend,
Sir Henry, and that I need no help of any kind."
  "Excellent!" said Stapleton. "You are perfectly right to be
wary and discreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an
unjustifiable intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention
the matter again."
  We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off
from the road and wound away across the moor. A steep,
boulder-sprinkled hill lay upon the right which had in bygone
days been cut into a granite quarry. The face which was turned
towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and brambles growing
in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a gray plume
of smoke.
  "A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit
House," said he. "Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may
have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister."
  My first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry's side. But
then I remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his
study table was littered. It was certain that I could not help with
those. And Holmes had expressly said that I should study the
neighbours upon the moor. I accepted Stapleton's invitation, and
we turned together down the path.
  "It is a wonderful place, the moor," said he, looking round
over the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of
jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges. "You never tire
of the moor. You cannot think the wonderful secrets which it
contains. It is so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious."
  "You know it well, then?"
  "I have only been here two years. The residents would call
me a newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But
my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round, and
I should think that there are few men who know it better than I
do."
  "Is it hard to know?"
  "Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the
north here with the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe
anything remarkable about that?"
  "It would be a rare place for a gallop."
  "You would naturally think so and the thought has cost
several their lives before now. You notice those bright green
spots scattered thickly over it?"
  "Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest."
  Stapleton laughed.
  "That is the great Grimpen Mire," said he. "A false step
yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I saw one
of the moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I saw his
head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it
sucked him down at last. Even in dry seasons it is a danger to
cross it, but after these autumn rains it is an awful place. And yet
I can find my way to the very heart of it and return alive. By
George, there is another of those miserable ponies!"
  Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green
sedges. Then a long, agonized, writhing neck shot upward and a
dreadful cry echoed over the moor. It turned me cold with
horror, but my companion's nerves seemed to be stronger than
mme.
  "It's gone!" said he. "The mire has him. Two in two days,
and many more, perhaps, for they get in the way of going there
in the dry weather and never know the difference until the mire
has them in its clutches. It's a bad place, the great Grimpen
Mire."
  "And you say you can penetrate it?"
  "Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can
take. I have found them out."
  "But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?"
  "Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut
off on all sides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round
them in the course of years. That is where the rare plants and the
butterflies are, if you have the wit to reach them."
  "I shall try my luck some day."
  He looked at me with a surprised face.
  "For God's sake put such an idea out of your mind," said he.
  "Your blood would be upon my head. I assure you that there
would not be the least chance of your coming back alive. It is
only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able
to do it."
  "Halloa!" I cried. "What is that?"
  A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It
filled the whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it
came. From a dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then
sank back into a melancholy, throbbing murmur once again.
Stapleton looked at me with a curious expression in his face.
  "Queer place, the moor!" said he.
  "But what is it?"
  "The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling
for its prey. I've heard it once or twice before, but never quite so
loud."
  I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge
swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing
stirred over the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked
loudly from a tor behind us.
  "You are an educated man. You don't believe such nonsense
as that?" said I. "What do you think is the cause of so strange a
sound?"
  "Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It's the mud settling, or
the water rising, or something."
  "No, no, that was a living voice."
  "Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?"
  "No, I never did."
  "It's a very rare bird -- practically extinct -- in England now,
but all things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be
surprised to learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of
the bitterns."
  "It's the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my
life."
  "Yes, it's rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the
hillside yonder. What do you make of those?"
  The whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of
stone, a score of them at least.
  "What are they? Sheep-pens?"
  "No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric
man lived thickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has
lived there since, we find all his little arrangements exactly as he
left them. These are his wigwams with the roofs off. You can
even see his hearth and his couch if you have the curiosity to go
inside.
  "But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?"
  "Neolithic man -- no date."
  "What did he do?"
  "He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig
for tin when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe.
Look at the great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark.
Yes, you will find some very singular points about the moor, Dr.
Watson. Oh, excuse me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides."
  A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an
instant Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and
speed in pursuit of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight
for the great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an
instant, bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving
in the air. His gray clothes and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress
made him not unlike some huge moth himself. I was standing
watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his extraor-
dinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the
treacherous mire when I heard the sound of steps and, turning
round, found a woman near me upon the path. She had come
from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the
position of Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her
until she was quite close.
  I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I
had been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the
moor, and I remembered that I had heard someone describe her
as being a beauty. The woman who approached me was certainly
that, and of a most uncommon type. There could not have been a
greater contrast between brother and sister, for Stapleton was
neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while she was
darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England -- slim,
elegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that
it might have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive
mouth and the beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure
and elegant dress she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a
lonely moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother as I turned,
and then she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised my hat
and was about to make some explanatory remark when her own
words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.
  "Go back!" she said. "Go straight back to London, instantly."
  I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at
me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.
  "Why should I go back?" I asked.
  "I cannot explain." She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a
curious lisp in her utterance. "But for God's sake do what I ask
you. Go back and never set foot upon the moor again."
  "But I have only just come."
  "Man, man!" she cried. "Can you not tell when a warning is
for your own good? Go back to London! Start to-night! Get away
from this place at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a
word of what I have said. Would you mind getting that orchid
for me among the mare's-tails yonder? We are very rich in
orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see
the beauties of the place."
  Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us
breathing hard and flushed with his exertions.
  "Halloa, Beryl!" said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of
his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.
  "Well, Jack, you are very hot."
  "Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom
found in the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed
him!" He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced
incessantly from the girl to me.
  "You have introduced yourselves, I can see."
  "Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to
see the true beauties of the moor."
  "Why, who do you think this is?"
  "I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville."
  "No, no," said I. "Only a humble commoner, but his friend.
My name is Dr. Watson."
  A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. "We
have been talking at cross purposes," said she.
  "Why, you had not very much time for talk," her brother
remarked with the same questioning eyes.
  "I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being
merely a visitor," said she. "It cannot much matter to him
whether it is early or late for the orchids. But you will come on,
will you not, and see Merripit House?"
  A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once
the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put
into repair and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard
surrounded it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were
stunted and nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean
and melancholy. We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-
coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house.
Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an ele-
gance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I
looked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked
moor rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but
marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man and
this beautiful woman to live in such a place.
  "Queer spot to choose, is it not?" said he as if in answer to
my thought. "And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly
happy, do we not, Beryl?"
  "Quite happy," said she, but there was no ring of conviction
in her words.
  "I had a school," said Stapleton. "It was in the north coun-
try. The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and
uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping
to mould those young minds, and of impressing them with one's
own character and ideals was very dear to me. However, the
fates were against us. A serious epidemic broke out in the school
and three of the boys died. It never recovered from the blow, and
much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet, if
it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the
boys, I could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my
strong tastes for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of
work here, and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All
this, Dr. Watson, has been brought upon your head by your
expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window."
  "It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little
dull -- less for you, perhaps, than for your sister."
  "No, no, I am never dull," said she quickly.
  "We have books, we have our studies, and we have interest-
ing neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own
line. Poor Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. We
knew him well and miss him more than I can tell. Do you think
that I should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the
acquaintance of Sir Henry?"
  "I am sure that he would be delighted."
  "Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so.
We may in our humble way do something to make things more
easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surround-
ings. Will you come upstairs, Dr. Watson, and inspect my
collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in
the south-west of England. By the time that you have looked
through them lunch will be almost ready."
  But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of
the moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound
which had been associated with the grim legend of the Basker-
villes, all these things tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on
the top of these more or less vague impressions there had come
the definite and distinct warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered
with such intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some
grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all pressure to stay
for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking
the grass-grown path by which we had come.
  It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut
for those who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was
astounded to see Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side
of the track. Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions
and she held her hand to her side.
  "I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,"
said she. "I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop,
or my brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I
am about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir
Henry. Please forget the words I said, which have no application
whatever to you."
  "But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton," said I. "I am Sir
Henry's friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine.
Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should
return to London."
  "A woman's whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better
you will understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I
say or do."
  "No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remembe the
look in your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss
Stapleton, for ever since I have been here I have been conscious
of shadows all round me. Life has become like that great Grimpen
Mire, with little green patches everywhere into which one may
sink and with no guide to point the track. Tell me then what it
was that you meant, and I will promise to convey your warning
to Sir Henry."
  An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her
face, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.
  "You make too much of it, Dr. Watson," said she. "My
brother and I were very much shocked by the death of Sir
Charles. We knew him very intimately, for his favourite walk
was over the moor to our house. He was deeply impressed with
the curse which hung over the family, and when this tragedy
came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the
fears which he had expressed. I was distressed therefore when
another member of the family came down to live here, and I felt
that he should be warned of the danger which he will run. That
was all which I intended to convey.
  "But what is the danger?"
  "You know the story of the hound?"
  "I do not believe in such nonsense."
  "But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him
away from a place which has always been fatal to his family.
The world is wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of
danger?"
  "Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir Henry's nature.
I fear that unless you can give me some more definite informa-
tion than this it would be impossible to get him to move."
  "I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything
definite."
  "I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you
meant no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should
you not wish your brother to overhear what you said? There is
nothing to which he, or anyone else, could object."
  "My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he
thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He
would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which
might induce Sir Henry to go away. But I have done my duty
now and I will say no more. I must go back, or he will miss me
and suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!" She turned and
had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders,
while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to
Baskerville Hall.

              First Report of Dr. Watson

  From this point onward I will follow the course of events by
transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie
before me on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they
are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the
moment more accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon
these tragic events, can possibly do.

                                 Baskerville Hall, October 13th.

My dear Holmes:
  My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well
up to date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken
corner of the world. The longer one stays here the more does the
spirit of the moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its
grim charm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have
left all traces of modern England behind you, but, on the other
hand, you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work
of the prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the
houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge
monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As
you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred hillsides you
leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a
skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a
flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you wouid feel that
his presence there was more natural than your own. The strange
thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must
always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I
could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race
who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy.
  All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent
me and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely
practical mind. I can still remember your complete indifference
as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round
the sun. Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir
Henry Baskerville.
  If you have not had any report within the last few days it is
because up to to-day there was nothing of importance to relate.
Then a very surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell
you in due course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touch
with some of the other factors in the situation.
  One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the
escaped convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to
believe that he has got right away, which is a considerable relief
to the lonely householders of this district. A fortnight has passed
since his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing
has been heard of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could
have held out upon the moor during all that time. Of course, so
far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all. Any one
of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place. But there is
nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the
moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone, and the
outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.
  We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we
could take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had
uneasy moments when I have thought of the Stapletons. They
live miles from any help. There are one maid, an old manser-
vant, the sister, and the brother, the latter not a very strong man.
They would be helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like
this Notting Hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance.
Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and it
was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep
there, but Stapleton would not hear of it.
  The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a
considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be won-
dered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active
man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman.
There is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a
singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother. Yet he
also gives the idea of hidden fires. He has certainly a very
marked influence over her, for I have seen her continually glance
at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said. I
trust that he is kind to her. There is a dry glitter in his eyes and a
firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a positive and possibly
a harsh nature. You would find him an interesting study.
  He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and
the very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where
the legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its
origin. It was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a
place which is so dismal that it might have suggested the story.
We found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an
open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass. In
the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the
upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of
some monstrous beast. In every way it corresponded with the
scene of the old tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and
asked Stapleton more than once whether he did really believe in
the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the
affairs of men. He spoke lightly, but it was evident that he was
very much in earnest. Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it
was easy to see that he said less than he might, and that he
would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the
feelings of the baronet. He told us of similar cases, where
families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left us
with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the
matter.
  On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it
was there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton.
From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly
attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not
mutual. He referred to her again and again on our walk home,
and since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen
something of the brother and sister. They dine here to-night, and
there is some talk of our going to them next week. One would
imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton,
and yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest
disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some
attention to his sister. He is much attached to her, no doubt, and
would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the
height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her making
so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that he does not wish
their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times
observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being
tete-a-tete. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow
Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous
if a love affair were to be added to our other difficulties. My
popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to
the letter.
  The other day -- Thursday, to be more exact -- Dr. Mortimer
lunched with us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down
and has got a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy.
Never was there such a single-minded enthusiast as he! The
Stapletons came in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to
the yew alley at Sir Henry's request to show us exactly how
everything occurred upon that fatal night. It is a long, dismal
walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped hedge,
with a narrow band of grass upon either side. At the far end is an
old tumble-down summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-
gate, where the old gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white
wooden gate with a latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I
remembered your theory of the affair and tried to picture all that
had occurred. As the old man stood there he saw something
coming across the moor, something which terrified him so that
he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and
exhaustion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which he
fled. And from what? A sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral
hound, black, silent, and monstrous? Was there a human agency
in the matter? Did the pale, watchful Barrymore know more than
he cared to say? It was all dim and vague, but always there is
the dark shadow of crime behind it.
  One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.
Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south
of us. He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and cho-
leric. His passion is for the British law, and he has spent a large
fortune in litigation. He fights for the mere pleasure of fighting
and is equally ready to take up either side of a question, so that it
is no wonder that he has found it a costly amusement. Some-
times he will shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make
him open it. At others he will with his own hands tear down
some other man's gate and declare that a path has existed there
from time immemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him for
trespass. He is learned in old manorial and communal rights, and
he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of
Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so that he is periodi-
cally either carried in triumph down the village street or else
burned in effigy, according to his latest exploit. He is said to
have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present, which will
probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw
his sting and leave him harmless for the future. Apart from the
law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I only mention
him because you were particular that I should send some descrip-
tion of the people who surround us. He is curiously employed at
present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent
telescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and
sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the
escaped convict. If he would confine his energies to this all
would be well, but there are rumours that he intends to prosecute
Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave without the consent of the next
of kin because he dug up the neolithic skull in the barrow on
Long Down. He helps to keep our lives from being monotonous
and gives a little comic relief where it is badly needed.
  And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped
convict, the Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter
Hall, let me end on that which is most important and tell you
more about the Barrymores, and especially about the surprising
development of last night.
  First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from
London in order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I
have already explained that the testimony of the postmaster
shows that the test was worthless and that we have no proof one
way or the other. I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he
at once, in his downright fashion, had Barrymore up and asked
him whether he had received the telegram himself. Barrymore
said that he had.
  "Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?" asked Sir
Henry.
  Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.
  "No," said he, "I was in the box-room at the time, and my
wife brought it up to me."
  "Did you answer it yourself?"
  "No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to
write it."
  In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.
  "I could not quite understand the object of your questions this
morning, Sir Henry," said he. "I trust that they do not mean
that I have done anything to forfeit your confidence?"
  Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him
by giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the
London outfit having now all arrived.
  Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid
person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be
puritanical. You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject.
Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard her
sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed
traces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at
her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which
haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a
domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something
singular and questionable in this man's character, but the adven-
ture of last night brings all my suspicions to a head.
  And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware
that I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on
guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever.
Last night, about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy
step passing my room. I rose, opened my door, and peeped out.
A long black shadow was trailing down the corridor. It was
thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a
candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no
covering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height
told me that it was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and
circumspectly, and there was something indescribably guilty and
furtive in his whole appearance.
  I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony
which runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther
side. I waited until he had passed out of sight and then I
followed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached
the end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer
of light through an open door that he had entered one of the
rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so
that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The light
shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down
the passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner
of the door.
  Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held
against the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his
face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the
blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood watching
intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient
gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my way back to my
room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more
upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen into
a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could
not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot
guess, but there is some secret business going on in this house of
gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. I do
not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to furnish
you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir Henry this
morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon
my observations of last night. I will not speak about it just now,
but it should make my next report interesting reading.

                        Chapter 9
               Second Report of Dr. Watson

                 THE LIGHT UPON THE MOOR

                                   Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th.

MY DEAR HOLMES:
  If I was compelled to leave you without much news during
the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am
making up for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick
and fast upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note
with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget
already which will, unless I am much mistaken, considera-
bly surprise you. Things have taken a turn which I could not
have anticipated. In some ways they have within the last forty-
eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have
become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you shall
judge for yourself.
  Before breakfast on the morning following my adventure I
went down the corridor and examined the room in which Barry-
more had been on the-night before. The western window through
which he had stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity
above all other windows in the house -- it commands the nearest
outlook on to the moor. There is an opening between two trees
which enables one from this point of view to look right down
upon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant
glimpse which can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barry-
more, since only this window would serve the purpose, must
have been looking out for something or somebody upon the
moor. The night was very dark, so that I can hardly imagine how
he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck me that it was
possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would have
accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness
of his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well
equipped to steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory
seemed to have something to support it. That opening of the door
whlch I had heard after I had returned to my room might mean
that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment. So I
reasoned with myself in the morning, and I tell you the direction
of my suspicions, however much the result may have shown that
they were unfounded.
  But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore's movements
might be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself
until I could explain them was more than I could bear. I had an
interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I told
him all that I had seen. He was less surprised than I had
expected.
  "I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a
mind to speak to him about it," said he. "Two or three times I
have heard hls steps in the passage, coming and going, just about
the hour you name."
  "Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular
window," I suggested.
  "Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and
see what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes
would do if he were here."
  "I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,"
said I. "He would follow Barrymore and see what he did."
  "Then we shall do it together."
  "But surely he would hear us."
  "The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our
chance of that. We'll sit up in my room to-night and wait until
he passes." Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was
evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat
quiet life upon the moor.
  The baronet has been in communication with the architect who
prepared the plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from
London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here
soon. There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plym-
outh, and it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means
to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his
family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he
will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves
there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the
lady is willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated
with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss
Stapleton. And yet the course of true love does not run quite as
smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect. To-day,
for example, its surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple,
which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance.
  After the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore,
Sir Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of
course I did the same.
  "What, are you coming, Watson?" he asked, looking at me in
a curious way.
  "That depends on whether you are going on the moor," said
I.
  "Yes, I am."
  "Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to
intrude, but you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I
should not leave you, and especially that you should not go alone
upon the moor."
  Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant
smile.
  "My dear fellow," said he, "Holmes, with all his wisdom,
did not foresee some things which have happened since I have
been on the moor. You understand me? I am sure that you are
the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I
must go out alone."
  It put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to
say or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked
up his cane and was gone.
  But when I came to think the matter over my conscience
reproached me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to
go out of my sight. I imagined what my feelings would be if I
had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had
occurred through my disregard for your instructions. I assure you
my cheeks flushed at the very thought. It might not even now be
too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of
Merripit House.
  I hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing
anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor
path branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the
wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could
command a view -- the same hill which is cut into the dark
quarry. Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor path
about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who
could only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear that there was already
an understanding between them and that they had met by ap-
pointment. They were walking slowly along in deep conversa-
tion, and I saw her making quick little movements of her hands
as if she were very earnest in what she was saying, while he
listened intently, and once or twice shook his head in strong
dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much
puzzled as to what I should do next. To follow them and break
into their intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet
my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight.
To act the spy upon a friend was a hateful task. Still, I could see
no better course than to observe him from the hill, and to clear
my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what I had done.
It is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him I was too
far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that you will agree with
me that the position was very difficult, and that there was
nothing more which I could do.
  Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and
were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was
suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their interview.
A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and another
glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man who
was moving among the broken ground. It was Stapleton with his
butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was,
and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this instant
Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His arm was
round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from
him with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she
raised one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring
apart and turn hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the
interruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net
dangling behind him. He gesticulated and almost danced with
excitement in front of the lovers. What the scene meant I could
not imagine, but it seemed to me that Stapleton was abusing Sir
Henry, who offered explanations, which became more angry as
the other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in haughty
silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in a
peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at
Sir Henry, walked off by the side of her brother. The naturalist's
angry gestures showed that the lady was included in his displea-
sure. The baronet stood for a minute looking after them, and
then he walked slowly back the way that he had come, his head
hanging, the very picture of dejection.
  What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply
ashamed to have witnessed so intimate a scene without my
friend's knowledge. I ran down the hill therefore and met the
baronet at the bottom. His face was flushed with anger and his
brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his wit's ends what to
do.
  "Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?" said he.
"You don't mean to say that you came after me in spite of all?"
  I explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible
to remain behind, how I had followed him, and how I had
witnessed all that had occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at
me, but my frankness disarmed his anger, and he broke at last
into a rather rueful laugh.
  "You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly
safe place for a man to be private," said he, "but, by thunder,
the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my
wooing -- and a mighty poor wooing at that! Where had you
engaged a seat?"
  "I was on that hill."
  "Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to
the front. Did you see him come out on us?"
  "Yes, I did."
  "Did he ever strike you as being crazy -- this brother of hers?"
  "I can't say that he ever did."
  "I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until
to-day, but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be
in a straitjacket. What's the matter with me, anyhow? You've
lived near me for some weeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is
there anything that would prevent me from making a good
husband to a woman that I loved?"
  "I should say not."
  "He can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myself
that he has this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt
man or woman in my life that I know of. And yet he would not
so much as let me touch the tips of her fingers."
  "Did he say so?"
  "That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've only known
her these few weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was
made for me, and she, too -- she was happy when she was with
me, and that I'll swear. There's a light in a woman's eyes that
speaks louder than words. But he has never let us get together
and it was only to-day for the first time that I saw a chance of
having a few words with her alone. She was glad to meet me,
but when she did it was not love that she would talk about, and
she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have
stopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of
danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I
told her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it,
and that if she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it
was for her to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as
many words to marry her, but before she could answer, down
came this brother of hers, running at us with a face on him like a
madman. He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his
were blazing with fury. What was I doing with the lady? How
dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her? Did I
think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he
had not been her brother I should have known better how to
answer him. As it was I told him that my feelings towards his
sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that
she might honour me by becoming my wife. That seemed to
make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I
answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, consider-
ing that she was standing by. So it ended by his going off with
her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in
this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe
you more than ever I can hope to pay."
  I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely
puzzled myself. Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, his
character, and his appearance are all in his favour, and I know
nothing against him unless it be this dark fate which runs in his
family. That his advances should be rejected so brusquely with-
out any reference to the lady's own wishes and that the lady
should accept the situation without protest is very amazing.
However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from Stapleton
himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies for
his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview
with Sir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was
that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit
House next Friday as a sign of it.
  "l don't say now that he isn't a crazy man," said Sir Henry
"I can't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this
morning, but I must allow that no man could make a more
handsome apology than he has done."
  "Did he give any explanation of his conduct?"
  "His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural
enough, and I am glad that he should understand her value. They
have always been together, and according to his account he has
been a very lonely man with only her as a companion, so that the
thought of losing her was really terrible to him. He had not
understood, he said, that I was becoming attached to her, but
when he saw with his own eyes that it was really so, and that she
might be taken away from him, it gave him such a shock that for
a time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He was
very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish
and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold
a beautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If
she had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like
myself than to anyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him
and it would take him some time before he could prepare himself
to meet it. He would withdraw all opposition upon his part if I
would promise for three months to let the matter rest and to be
content with cultivating the lady's friendship during that time
without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the matter
rests."
  So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is
something to have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which
we are floundering. We know now why Stapleton looked with
disfavour upon his sister's suitor -- even when that suitor was so
eligible a one as Sir Henry. And now I pass on to another thread
which I have extricated out of the tangled skein, the mystery of
the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained face of Mrs. Barrymore,
of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattice window.
Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me that I have not
disappointed you as an agent -- that you do not regret the confi-
dence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All
these things have by one night's work been thoroughly cleared.
  I have said "by one night's work," but, in truth, it was by
two nights' work, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up
with Sir Henry in his rooms until nearly three o'clock in the
morning, but no sound of any sort did we hear except the
chiming clock upon the stairs. It was a most melancholy vigil
and ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs. Fortunately
we were not discouraged, and we determined to try again. The
next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes
without making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the
hours crawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same
sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches
the trap into which he hopes the game may wander. One struck,
and two, and we had almost for the second time given it up in
despair when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chairs
with all our weary senses keenly on the alert once more. We had
heard the creak of a step in the passage.
  Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the
distance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out
in pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the
corridor was all in darkness. Softly we stole along untii we had
come into the other wing. We were just in time to catch a
glimpse of the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded
as he tiptoed down the passage. Then he passed through the
same door as before, and the light of the candle framed it in the
darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of
the corridor. We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every
plank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had
taken the precaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even
so, the old boards snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Some-
times it seemed impossible that he should fail to hear our ap-
proach. However, the man is fortunately rather deaf, and he was
entirely preoccupied in that which he was doing. When at last we
reached the door and peeped through we found him crouching at
the window, candle in hand, his white, intent face pressed
against the pane, exactly as I had seen him two nights before.
  We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a
man to whom the most direct way is always the most natural. He
walked into the room, and as he did so Barrymore sprang up
from the window with a sharp hiss of his breath and stood, livid
and trembling, before us. His dark eyes, glaring out of the white
mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he
gazed from Sir Henry to me.
  "What are you doing here, Barrymore?"
  "Nothing, sir." His agitation was so great that he could
hardly speak, and the shadows sprang up and down from the
shaking of his candle. "It was the window, sir. I go round at
night to see that they are fastened."
  "On the second floor?"
  "Yes, sir, all the windows."
  "Look here, Barrymore," said Sir Henry sternly, "we have
made up our minds to have the truth out of you, so it will save
you trouble to tell it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No
lies! What were you doing at that window??'
  The fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his
hands together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and
misery.
  "I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the
window."
  "And why were you holding a candle to the window?"
  "Don't ask me, Sir Henry -- don't ask me! I give you my
word, sir, that it is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it
concerned no one but myself I would not try to keep it from
you."
  A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the
trembling hand of the butler.
  "He must have been holding it as a signal," said I. "Let us
see if there is any answer." I held it as he had done, and stared
out into the darkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the
black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for
the moon was behind the clouds. And then I gave a cry of
exultation, for a tiny pin-point of yellow light had suddenly
transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the
black square framed by the window.
  "There it is!" I cried.
  "No, no, sir, it is nothing -- nothing at all!" the butler broke
in; "I assure you, sir --"
  "Move your light across the window, Watson!" cried the
baronet. "See, the other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you
deny that it is a signal? Come, speak up! Who is your confeder-
ate out yonder, and what is this conspiracy that is going on?"
  The man's face became openly defiant.
  "It is my business, and not yours. I will not tell."
  "Then you leave my employment right away."
  "Very good, sir. If I must I must."
  "And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be
ashamed of yourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a
hundred years under this roof, and here I find you deep in some
dark plot against me."
  "No, no, sir; no, not against you!" It was a woman's voice,
and Mrs. Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her
husband, was standing at the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl
and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intensity of
feeling upon her face.
  "We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our
things," said the butler.
  "Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing,
Sir Henry -- all mine. He has done nothing except for my sake
and because I asked him."
  "Speak out, then! What does it mean?"
  "My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let
him perish at our very gates. The light is a signal to him that
food is ready for him, and his light out yonder is to show the
spot to which to bring it."
  "Then your brother is --"
  "The escaped convict, sir -- Selden, the criminal."
  "That's the truth, sir," said Barrymore. "I said that it was not
my secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have
heard it, and you will see that if there was a plot it was not
against you."
  This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at
night and the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at
the woman in amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly
respectable person was of the same blood as one of the most
notorious criminals in the country?
  "Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother.
We humoured him too much when he was a lad and gave him his
own way in everything until he came to think that the world was
made for his pleasure, and that he could do what he liked in it.
Then as he grew older he met wicked companions, and the devil
entered into him until he broke my mother's heart and dragged
our name in the dirt. From crime to crime he sank lower and
lower until it is only the mercy of God which has snatched him
from the scaffold; but to me, sir, he was always the little
curly-headed boy that I had nursed and played with as an elder
sister would. That was why he broke prison, sir. He knew that I
was here and that we could not refuse to help him. When he
dragged himself here one night, weary and starving, with the
warders hard at his heels, what could we do? We took him in
and fed him and cared for him. Then you returned, sir, and my
brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywhere
else until the hue and cry was over, so he lay in hiding there. But
every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting
a light in the window, and if there was an answer my husband
took out some bread and meat to him. Every day we hoped that
he was gone, but as long as he was there we could not desert
him. That is the whole truth, as I am an honest Christian woman
and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it does not lie
with my husband but with me, for whose sake he has done all
that he has."
  The woman's words came with an intense earnestness which
carried conviction with them.
  "Is this true, Barrymore?"
  "Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it."
  "Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife.
Forget what I have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall
talk further about this matter in the morning."
  When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir
Henry had flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon
our faces. Far away in the black distance there still glowed that
one tiny point of yellow light.
  "I wonder he dares," said Sir Henry.
  "It may be so placed as to be only visible from here."
  "Very likely. How far do you think it is?"
  "Out by the Cleft Tor, I think."
  "Not more than a mile or two off."
  "Hardly that."
  "Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food
to it. And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By
thunder, Watson, I am going out to take that man!"
  The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if
the Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret
had been forced from them. The man was a danger to the
community, an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was nei-
ther pity nor excuse. We were only doing our duty in taking this
chance of putting him back where he could do no harm. With his
brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the price if
we held our hands. Any night, for example, our neighbours the
Stapletons might be attacked by him, and it may have been the
thought of this which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.
  "I will come," said I.
  "Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner
we start the better, as the fellow may put out his light and be
off."
  In five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our
expedition. We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the
dull moaning of the autumn wind and the rustle of the falling
leaves. The night air was heavy with the smell of damp and
decay. Now and again the moon peeped out for an instant, but
clouds were driving over the face of the sky, and just as we came
out on the moor a thin rain began to fall. The light still burned
steadily in front.
  "Are you armed?" I asked.
  "I have a hunting-crop."
  "We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a
desperate fellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at
our mercy before he can resist."
  "I say, Watson," said the baronet, "what would Holmes say
to this? How about that hour of darkness in which the power of
evil is exalted?"
  As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the
vast gloom of the moor that strange cry which I had already
heard upon the borders of the great Grimpen Mire. It came with
the wind through the silence of the night, a long, deep mutter
then a rising howl, and then the sad moan in which it died away.
Again and again it sounded, the whole air throbbing with it,
strident, wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my sleeve and
his face glimmered white through the darkness.
  "My God, what's that, Watson?"
  "I don't know. It's a sound they have on the moor. I heard it
once before."
  It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We
stood straining our ears, but nothing came.
  "Watson," said the baronet, "it was the cry of a hound."
  My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his
voice which told of the sudden horror which had seized him.
  "What do they call this sound?" he asked.
  "Who?"
  "The folk on the countryside."
  "Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what
they call it?"
  "Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?"
  I hesitated but could not escape the question.
  "They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles."
  He groaned and was silent for a few moments.
  "A hound it was," he said at last, "but it seemed to come
from miles away, over yonder, I think."
  "It was hard to say whence it came."
  "It rose and fell with the wind. Isn't that the direction of the
great Grimpen Mire?"
  "Yes, it is."
  "Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn't you think
yourself that it was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You
need not fear to speak the truth."
  "Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it
might be the calling of a strange bird."
  "No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in
all these stories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so
dark a cause? You don't believe it, do you, Watson?"
  "No, no."
  "And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it
is another to stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to
hear such a cry as that. And my uncle! There was the footprint of
the hound beside him as he lay. It all fits together. I don't think
that I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze my
very blood. Feel my hand!"
  It was as cold as a block of marble.
  "You'll be all right to-morrow."
  "I don't think I'll get that cry out of my head. What do you
advise that we do now?"
  "Shall we turn back?"
  "No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we
will do it. We after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as
not, after us. Come on! We'll see it through if all the fiends of
the pit were loose upon the moor."
  We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black
loom of the craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light
burning steadily in front. There is nothing so deceptive as the
distance of a light upon a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the
glimmer seemed to be far away upon the horizon and sometimes
it might have been within a few yards of us. But at last we could
see whence it came, and then we knew that we were indeed very
close. A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks
which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and
also to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of
Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach,
and crouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It
was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle
of the moor, with no sign of life near it -- just the one straight
yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it.
  "What shall we do now?" whispered Sir Henry.
  "Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can
get a glimpse of him."
  The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw
him. Over the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned,
there was thrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face,
all seamed and scored with vile passions. Foul with mire, with a
bristling beard, and hung with matted hair, it might well have
belonged to one of those old savages who dwelt in the burrows
on the hillsides. The light beneath him was reflected in his small,
cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and left through the
darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard the steps
of the hunters.
  Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have
been that Barrymore had some private signal which we had
neglected to give, or the fellow may have had some other reason
for thinking that all was not well, but I could read his fears upon
his wicked face. Any instant he might dash out the light and
vanish in the darkness. I sprang forward therefore, and Sir Henry
did the same. At the same moment the convict screamed out a
curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against the
boulder which had sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his
short, squat, strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and
turned to run. At the same moment by a lucky chance the moon
broke through the clouds. We rushed over the brow of the hill,
and there was our man running with great speed down the other
side, springing over the stones in his way with the activity of a
mountain goat. A lucky long shot of my revolver might have
crippled him, but I had brought it only to defend myself if
attacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running
away.
  We were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we
soon found that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw
him for a long time in the moonlight until he was only a small
speck moving swiftly among the boulders upon the side of a
distant hill. We ran and ran until we were completely blown, but
the space between us grew ever wider. Finally we stopped and
sat panting on two rocks, while we watched him disappearing in
the distance.
  And it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange
and unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were
turning to go home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The
moon was low upon the right, and the jagged pinnacle of a
granite tor stood up against the lower curve of its silver disc.
There, outlined as black as an ebony statue on that shining
background, I saw the figure of a man upon the tor. Do not think
that it was a delusion, Holmes. I assure you that I have never in
my life seen anything more clearly. As far as I could judge, the
figure was that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs a little
separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were
brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite
which lay before him. He might have been the very spirit of that
terrible place. It was not the convict. This man was far from the
place where the latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much
taller man. With a cry of surprise I pointed him out to the
baronet, but in the instant during which I had turned to grasp his
arm the man was gone. There was the sharp pinnacle of granite
still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but its peak bore no
trace of that silent and motionless figure.
  I wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it was
some distance away. The baronet's nerves were still quivering
from that cry, which recalled the dark story of his family, and he
was not in the mood for fresh adventures. He had not seen this
lonely man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which his
strange presence and his commanding attitude had given to me.
"A warder, no doubl," said he. "The moor has been thick with
them since this fellow escaped." Well, perhaps his explanation
may be the right one, but I should like to have some further
proof of it. To-day we mean to communicate to the Princetown
people where they should look for their missing man, but it is
hard lines that we have not actually had the triumph of bringing
him back as our own prisoner. Such are the adventures of last
night, and you must acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have
done you very well in the matter of a report. Much of what I tell
you is no doubt quite irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that
I should let you have all the facts and leave you to select for
yourself those which will be of most service to you in helping
you to your conclusilons. We are certainly making some prog-
ress. So far as the Barrymores go we have found the motive of
their actions, and that has cleared up the situation very much.
But the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants re-
mains as inscrutable as ever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to
throw some light upon this also. Best of all would it be if you
could come down to us. In any case you will hear from me again
in the course of the next few days.
         
                       Chapter 10
           Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson

  So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I
have forwarded during these early days to Sherlock Holmes.
Now, however, I have arrived at a point in my narrative where I
am compelled to abandon this method and to trust once more to
my recollections, aided by the diary which I kept at the time. A
few extracts from the latter will carry me on to those scenes
which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I
proceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive
chase of the convict and our other strange experiences upon the
moor.
  October 16th. A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain. The
house is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then
to show the dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins
upon the sides of the hills, and the distant boulders gleaming
where the light strikes upon their wet faces. It is melancholy
outside and in. The baronet is in a black reaction after the
excitements of the night. I am conscious myself of a weight at
my heart and a feeling of impending danger -- ever present dan-
ger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define it.
  And have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long
sequence of incidents which have all pointed to some sinister
influence which is at work around us. There is the death of the
last occupant of the Hall, fulfilling so exactly the conditions of
the family legend, and there are the repeated reports from peas-
ants of the appearance of a strange creature upon the moor.
Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound which resem-
bled the distant baying of a hound. It is incredible, impossible,
that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of nature. A
spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the air
with its howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may fall
in with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one
quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade
me to believe in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to
the level of these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere
fiend dog but must needs describe him with hell-fire shooting
from his mouth and eyes. Holmes would not listen to such
fancies, and I am his agent. But facts are facts, and I have twice
heard this crying upon the moor. Suppose that there were really
some huge hound loose upon it; that would go far to explain
everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where
did it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no
one saw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explana-
tion offers almost as many difficulties as the other. And always,
apart from the hound, there is the fact of the human agency in
London, the man in the cab, and the letter which warned Sir
Henry against the moor. This at least was real, but it might have
been the work of a protecting friend as easily as of an enemy.
Where is that friend or enemy now? Has he remained in London,
or has he followed us down here? Could he -- could he be the
stranger whom I saw upon the tor?
  It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet
there are some things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one
whom I have seen down here, and I have now met all the
neighbours. The figure was far taller than that of Stapleton, far
thinner than that of Frankland. Barrymore it might possibly have
been, but we had left him behind us, and I am certain that he
could not have followed us. A stranger then is still dogging us,
just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never shaken
him off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we
might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one
purpose I must now devote all my energies.
  My first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My
second and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as little
as possible ta anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have
been strangely shaken by that sound upon the moor. I will say
nothing to add to his anxieties, but I will take my own steps to
attain my own end.
  We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore
asked leave to speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in
his study some little time. Sitting in the billiard-room I more
than once heard the sound of voices raised, and I had a pretty
good idea what the point was which was under discussion. After
a time the baronet opened his door and called for me.
  "Barrymore considers that he has a grievance," he said. "He
thinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law
down when he, of his own free will, had told us the secret."
  The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.
  "I may have spoken too warmly, sir," said he, "and if I 
have, I am sure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was
very much surprised when I heard you two gentlemen come back
this morning and learned that you had been chasing Selden. The
poor fellow has enough to fight against without my putting more
upon his track."
  "If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a
different thing," said the baronet, "you only told us, or rather
your wife only told us, when it was forced from you and you
could not help yourself."
  "I didn't think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir 
Henry -- indeed I didn't."
  "The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scat-
tered over the moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at
nothing. You only want to get a glimpse of his face to see that.
Look at Mr. Stapleton's house, for example, with no one but
himself to defend it. There's no safety for anyone untill he is
under lock and key."
  "He'll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word
upon that. But he will never trouble anyone in this country
again. I assure you, Sir Henry, that in a very few days the
necessary arrangements will have been made and he will be on
his way to South America. For God's sake, sir, I beg of you not
to let the police know that he is still on the moor. They have
given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the ship is
ready for him. You can't tell on him without getting my wife
and me into trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the
police."
  "What do you say, Watson?"
  I shrugged my shoulders. "If he were safely out of the
country it would relieve the tax-payer of a burden."
  "But how about the chance of his holding someone up before
he goes?"
  "He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided
him with all that he can want. To commit a crime would be to
show where he was hiding."
  "That is true," said Sir Henry. "Well, Barrymore --"
  "God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would
have killed my poor wife had he been taken again."
  "I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But,
after what we have heard I don't feel as if I could give the man
up, so there is an end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go."
  With a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he
hesitated and then came back.
  "You've been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the
best I can for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and
perhaps I should have said it before, but it was long after the
inquest that I found it out. I've never breathed a word about it
yet to mortal man. It's about poor Sir Charles's death."
  The baronet and I were both upon our feet. "Do you know
how he died?"
  "No, sir, I don't know that."
  "What then?"
  "I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a
woman."
  "To meet a woman! He?"
  "Yes, sir."
  "And the woman's name?"
  "I can't give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials.
Her initials were L. L."
  "How do you know this, Barrymore?"
  "Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He
had usually a great many letters, for he was a public man and
well known for his kind heart, so that everyone who was in
trouble was glad to turn to him. But that morning, as it chanced,
there was only this one letter, so I took the more notice of it. It
was from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed in a woman's
hand."
  "Well?"
  "Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would
have done had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago
she was cleaning out Sir Charles's study -- it had never been
touched since his death -- and she found the ashes of a burned
letter in the back of the grate. The greater part of it was charred
to pieces, but one little slip, the end of a page, hung together,
and the writing could still be read, though it was gray on a black
ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter
and it said: 'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn this
letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were signed
the initials L. L."
  "Have you got that slip?"
  "No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it."
  "Had Sir Charles received any other lettefs in the same
writting?"
  "Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should
not have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone."
  "And you have no idea who L. L. is?"
  "No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay
our hands upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles's
death."
  "I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal
this important information."
  "Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came
to us. And then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir
Charles, as we well might be considering all that he has done for
us. To rake this up couldn't help our poor master, and it's well
to go carefully when there's a lady in the case. Even the best of
us --"
  "You thought it might injure his reputation?"
  "Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you
have been kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you
unfairly not to tell you all that I know about the matter."
  "Very good, Barrymore; you can go." When the butler had
left us Sir Henry turned to me. "Well, Watson, what do you
think of this new light?"
  "It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before."
  "So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up
the whole business. We have gained that much. We know that
there is someone who has the facts if we can only find her. What
do you think we should do?"
  "Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the
clue for which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it
does not bring him down."
  I went at once to my room and drew up my report of the
morning's conversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he
had been very busy of late, for the notes which I had from Baker
Street were few and short, with no comments upon the informa-
tion which I had supplied and hardly any reference to my mis-
sion. No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing all his faculties.
And yet this new factor must surely arrest his attention and
renew his interest. I wish that he were here.
  October 17th. All day to-day the rain poured down, rustling
on the ivy and dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict
out upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever
his crimes, he has suffered something to atone for them. And
then I thought of that other one -- the face in the cab, the figure
against the moon. Was he also out in that deluged -- the unseen
watcher, the man of darkness? In the evening I put on my
waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor, full of dark
imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and the wind whis-
tling about my ears. God help those who wander into the great
mire now, for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass. I
found the black tor upon which I had seen the solitary watcher,
and from its craggy summit I looked out myself across the
melancholy downs. Rain squalls drifted across their russet face,
and the heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung low over the land-
scape, trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the fantastic
hills. In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the mist,
the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees.
They were the only signs of human life which I could see, save
only those prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of
the hills. Nowhere was there any trace of that lonely man whom
I had seen on the same spot two nights before.
  As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in
his dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the
outlying farmhouse of Foulmire. He has been very attentive to
us, and hardly a day has passed that he has not called at the Hall
to see how we were getting on. He insisted upon my climbing
into his dog-cart, and he gave me a lift homeward. I found him
much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel. It had
wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I gave him
such consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the
Grimpen Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog
again.
  "By the way, Mortimer," said I as we jolted along the rough
road, "I suppose there are few people living within driving
distance of this whom you do not know?"
  "Hardly any, I think."
  "Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose
initials are L. L.?"
  He thought for a few minutes.
  "No," said he. "There are a few gipsies and labouring folk
for whom I can't answer, but among the farmers or gentry there
is no one whose initials are those. Wait a bit though," he added
after a pause. "There is Laura Lyons -- her initials are L. L. -- but
she lives in Coombe Tracey."
  "Who is she?" I asked.
  "She is Frankland's daughter."
  "What! Old Frankland the crank?"
  "Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came
sketching on the moor. He proved to be a blackguard and
deserted her. The fault from what I hear may not have been
entirely on one side. Her father refused to have anything to do
with her because she had married without his consent and per-
haps for one or two other reasons as well. So, between the old
sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time."
  "How does she live?"
  "I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be
more, for his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever
she may have deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly
to the bad. Her story got about, and several of the people here
did something to enable her to earn an honest living. Stapleton
did for one, and Sir Charles for another. I gave a trifle myself. It
was to set her up in a typewriting business."
  He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed
to satisfy his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is
no reason why we should take anyone into our confidence.
To-morrow morning I shall find my way to Coombe Tracey, and
if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of equivocal reputation, a
long step will have been made towards clearing one incident in
this chain of mysteries. I am certainly developing the wisdom of
the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an
inconvenient extent I asked him casually to what type Frank-
land's skull belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for
the rest of our drive. I have not lived for years with Sherlock
Holmes for nothing.
  I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous
and melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore
just now, which gives me one more strong card which I can play
in due time.
  Mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played
ecarte afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the
library, and I took the chance to ask him a few questions.
  "Well," said I, "has this precious relation of yours departed,
or is he still lurking out yonder?"
  "I don't know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he
has brought nothing but trouble here! I've not heard of him since
I left out food for him last, and that was three days ago."
  "Did you see him then?"
  "No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way."
  "Then he was certainly there?"
  "So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who
took it."
  I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at
Barrymore.
  "You know that there is another man then?"
  "Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor."
  "Have you seen him?"
  "No, sir."
  "How do you know of him then?"
  "Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He's in
hiding, too, but he's not a convict as far as I can make out. I
don't like it, Dr. Watson -- I tell you straight, sir, that I don't like
it." He spoke with a sudden passion of earnestness.
  "Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this
matter but that of your master. I have come here with no object
except to help him. Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don't
like."
  Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his
outburst or found it difficult to express his own feelings in
words.
  "It's all these goings-on, sir," he cried at last, waving his
hand towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor.
"There's foul play somewhere, and there's black villainy brew-
ing, to that I'll swear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir
Henry on his way back to London again!"
  "But what is it that alarms you?"
  "Look at Sir Charles's death! That was bad enough, for all
that the coroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night.
There's not a man would cross it after sundown if he was paid
for it. Look at this stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and
waiting! What's he waiting for? What does it mean? It means no
good to anyone of the name of Baskerville, and very glad I shall
be to be quit of it all on the day that Sir Henry's new servants are
ready to take over the Hall."
  "But about this stranger," said I. "Can you tell me anything
about him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid,
or what he was doing?"
  "He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives
nothing away. At first he thought that he was the police, but
soon he found that he had some lay of his own. A kind of
gentleman he was, as far as he could see, but what he was doing
he could not make out."
  "And where did he say that he lived?"
  "Among the old houses on the hillside -- the stone huts where
the old folk used to live."
  "But how about his food?"
  "Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and
brings all he needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for
what he wants."
  "Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some
other time." When the butler had gone I walked over to the
black window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving
clouds and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees. It is a
wild night indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the
moor. What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk
in such a place at such a time! And what deep and earnest
purpose can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that
hut upon the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem
which has vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not
have passed before I have done all that man can do to reach the
heart of the mystery.

                        Chapter 11
                    The Man on the Tor

  The extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter
has brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time
when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their
terrible conclusion. The incidents of the next few days are
indelibly graven upon my recollection, and I can tell them
without reference to the notes made at the time. I start them from
the day which succeeded that upon which I had established two
facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura Lyons of
Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made
an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met
his death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be
found among the stone huts upon the hillside. With these two
facts in my possession I felt that either my intelligence or my
courage must be deficient if I could not throw some further light
upon these dark places.
  I had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned
about Mrs. Lyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer
remained with him at cards until it was very late. At breakfast,
however, I informed him about my discovery and asked him
whether he would care to accompany me to Coombe Tracey. At
first he was very eager to come, but on second thoughts it
seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might be
better. The more formal we made the visit the less information
we might obtain. I left Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without
some prickings of conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.
  When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the
horses, and I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to
interrogate. I had no difficulty in finding her rooms, which were
central and well appointed. A maid showed me in without cere-
mony, and as I entered the sitting-room a lady, who was sitting
before a Remington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile
of welcome. Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a
stranger, and she sat down again and asked me the object of my
visit.
  The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme
beauty. Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour,
and her cheeks, though considerably freckled, were flushed with
the exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty pink which lurks
at the heart of the sulphur rose. Admiration was, I repeat, the
first impression. But the second was criticism. There was some-
thing subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of expres-
sion, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness of lip
which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are after-
thoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in
the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was
asking me the reasons for my visit. I had not quite understood
until that instant how delicate my mission was.
  "I have the pleasure," said I, "of knowing your father."
It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it.
  "There is nothing in common between my father and me,"
she said. "I owe him nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it
were not for the late Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind
hearts I might have starved for all that my father cared."
  "It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come
here to see you."
  The freckles started out on the lady's face.
  "What can I tell you about him?" she asked, and her fingers
played nervously over the stops of her typewriter.
  "You knew him, did you not?"
  "I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If
I am able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which
he took in my unhappy situation."
  "Did you correspond with him?"
  The lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel
eyes.
  "What is the object of these questions?" she asked sharply.
  "The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I
should ask them here than that the matter should pass outside our
control."
  She was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she
looked up with something reckless and defiant in her manner.
  "Well, I'll answer," she said. "What are your questions?"
  "Did you correspond with Sir Charles?"
  "I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his
delicacy and his generosity."
  "Have you the dates of those letters?"
  "No."
  "Have you ever met him?"
  "Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He
was a very retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth."
  "But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did
he know enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you
say that he has done?"
  She met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.
  "There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and
united to help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and
intimate friend of Sir Charles's. He was exceedingly kind, and it
was through him that Sir Charles learned about my affairs."
  I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton
his almoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement bore
the impress of truth upon it.
  "Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?"
I continued.
  Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again.
  "Really, sir, this is a very extraordinary question."
  "I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it."
  "Then I answer, certainly not."
  "Not on the very day of Sir Charles's death?"
  The flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was
before me. Her dry lips could not speak the "No" which I saw
rather than heard.
  "Surely your memory deceives you," said I. "I could even
quote a passage of your letter. It ran 'Please, please, as you are a
gentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock.' "
  I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a
supreme effort.
  "Is there no such thing as a gentleman?" she gasped.
  "You do Sir Charles an injustice. He did burn the letter. But
sometimes a letter may be legible even when burned. You
acknowledge now that you wrote it?"
  "Yes, I did write it," she cried, pouring out her soul in a
torrent of words. "I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have no
reason to be ashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I believed
that if I had an interview I could gain his help, so I asked him to
meet me."
  "But why at such an hour?"
  "Because I had only just learned that he was going to London
next day and might be away for months. There were reasons why
I could not get there earlier."
  "But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the
house?"
  "Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a
bachelor's house?"
  "Well, what happened when you did get there?"
  "I never went."
  "Mrs. Lyons!"
  "No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went.
Something intervened to prevent my going."
  "What was that?"
  "That is a private matter. I cannot tell it."
  "You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with
Sir Charles at the very hour and place at which he met his death,
but you deny that you kept the appointment."
  "That is the truth."
  Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get
past that point.
  "Mrs. Lyons," said I as I rose from this long and inconclu-
sive interview, "you are taking a very great responsibility and
putting yourself in a very false position by not making an
absolutely clean breast of all that you know. If I have to call in
the aid of the police you will find how seriously you are compro-
mised. If your position is innocent, why did you in the first
instance deny having written to Sir Charles upon that date?"
  "Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn
from it and that I might find myself involved in a scandal."
  "And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should
destroy your letter?"
  "If you have read the letter you will know."
  "I did not say that I had read all the letter."
  "You quoted some of it."
  "I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned
and it was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that
you were so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter
which he received on the day of his death."
  "The matter is a very private one."
  "The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation."
  "I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my
unhappy history you will know that I made a rash marriage and
had reason to regret it."
  "I have heard so much."
  "My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband
whom I abhor. The law is upon his side, and every day I
am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him.
At the time that I wrote this letter to Sir Charles I had learned
that there was a prospect of my regaining my freedom if certain
expenses could be met. It meant everything to me -- peace of
mind, happiness, self-respect -- everything. I knew Sir Charles's
generosity, and I thought that if he heard the story from my own
lips he would help me."
  "Then how is it that you did not go?"
  "Because I received help in the interval from another source."
  "Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain
this?"
  "So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper
next morning."
  The woman's story hung coherently together, and all my
questions were unable to shake it. I could only check it by
finding if she had, indeed, instituted divorce proceedings against
her husband at or about the time of the tragedy.
  It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not
been to Baskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would
be necessary to take her there, and could not have returned to
Coombe Tracey until the early hours of the morning. Such an
excursion could not be kept secret. The probability was, there-
fore, that she was telling the truth, or, at least, a part of the
truth. I came away baffled and disheartened. Once again I had
reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every
path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet
the more I thought of the lady's face and of her manner the more
I felt that something was being held back from me. Why should
she turn so pale? Why should she fight against every admission
until it was forced from her? Why should she have been so
reticent at the time of the tragedy? Surely the explanation of all
this could not be as innocent as she would have me believe. For
the moment I could proceed no farther in that direction, but must
turn back to that other clue which was to be sought for among
the stone huts upon the moor.
  And that was a most vague direction. I realized it as I drove
back and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient
people. Barrymore's only indication had been that the stranger
lived in one of these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of
them are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the
moor. But I had my own experience for a guide since it had
shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of the
Black Tor. That, then, should be the centre of my search. From
there I should explore every hut upon the moor until I lighted
upon the right one. If this man were inside it I should find out
from his own lips, at the point of my revolver if necessary, who
he was and why he had dogged us so long. He might slip away
from us in the crowd of Regent Street, but it would puzzle him
to do so upon the lonely moor. On the other hand, if I should
find the hut and its tenant should not be within it I must remain
there, however long the vigil, until he returned. Holmes had
missed him in London. It would indeed be a triumph for me if I
could run him to earth where my master had failed.
  Luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but
now at last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good
fortune was none other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing,
gray-whiskered and red-faced, outside the gate of bis garden,
which opened on to the highroad along which I travelled.
  "Good-day, Dr. Watson," cried he with unwonted good
humour, "you must really give your horses a rest and come in to
have a glass of wine and to congratulate me."
  My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly
after what I had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was
anxious to send Perkins and the wagonette home, and the oppor-
tunity was a good one. I alighted and sent a message to Sir
Henry that I should walk over in time for dinner. Then I fol-
lowed Frankland into his dining-room.
  "It is a great day for me, sir -- one of the red-letter days of my
life," he cried with many chuckles. "I have brought off a double
event. I mean to teach them in these parts that law is law, and
that there is a man here who does not fear to invoke it. I have
established a right of way through the centre of old Middleton's
park, slap across it, sir, within a hundred yards of his own front
door. What do you think of that? We'll teach these magnates that
they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of the commoners,
confound them! And I've closed the wood where the Fernworthy
folk used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that
there are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where
they like with their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided
Dr. Watson, and both in my favour. I haven't had such a day
since I had Sir John Morland for trespass because he shot in his
own warren."
  "How on earth did you do that?"
  "Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading -- Frankland
v. Morland, Court of Queen's Bench. It cost me 200 pounds, but I got
my verdict."
  "Did it do you any good?"
  "None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in
the matter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no
doubt, for example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in
effigy to-night. I told the police last time they did it that they
should stop these disgraceful exhibitions. The County Constabu-
lary is in a scandalous state, sir, and it has not afforded me the
protection to which I am entitled. The case of Frankland v.
Regina will bring the matter before the attention of the public. I
told them that they would have occasion to regret their treatment
of me, and already my words have come true."
  "How so?" I asked.
  The oId man put on a very knowing expression.
  "Because I could tell them what they are dying to know; but
nothing would induce me to help the rascals in any way."
  I had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get
away from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of
it. I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to
understand that any strong sign of interest would be the surest way
to stop his confidences.
  "Some poaching case, no doubt?" said I with an indifferent
manner~
  "Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than
that! What about the convict on the moor?"
  I stared. "You don't mean that you know where he is?" said
I.
  "I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that
I could help the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never
struck you that the way to catch that man was to find out where
he got his food and so trace it to him?"
  He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the
truth. "No doubt," said I; "but how do you know that he is
anywhere upon the moor?"
  "I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the
messenger who takes him his food."
  My heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in
the power of this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took
a weight from my mind.
  "You'll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a
child. I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof.
He passes along the same path at the same hour, and to whom
should he be going except to the convict?"
  Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of
interest. A child! Barrymore had said that our unknown was
supplied by a boy. It was on his track, and not upon the
convict's, that Frankland had stumbled. If I could get his knowl-
edge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But incredulity
and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.
  "I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son
of one of the moorland shepherds taking out his father's dinner."
  The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old
autocrat. His eyes looked malignantly at me, and his gray whis-
kers bristled like those of an angry cat.
  "Indeed, sir!" said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching
moor. "Do you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you
see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it? It is the
stoniest part of the whole moor. Is that a place where a shepherd
would be likely to take his station? Your suggestion, sir, is a
most absurd one."
  I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the
facts. My submission pleased him and led him to further
confidences.
  "You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I
come to an opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his
bundle. Every day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been
able -- but wait a moment, Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me,
or is there at the present moment something moving upon that
hillside?"
  It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark
dot against the dull green and gray.
  "Come, sir, come!" cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. "You
will see with your own eyes and judge for yourself."
  The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tri-
pod, stood upon the flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped
his eye to it and gave a cry of satisfaction.
  "Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!"
  There he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle
upon his shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached
the crest I saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant
against the cold blue sky. He looked round him with a furtive
and stealthy air, as one who dreads pursuit. Then he vanished
over the hill.
  "Well! Am I right?"
  "Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret
errand."
  "And what the errand is even a county constable could guess.
But not one word shall they have from me, and I bind you to
secrecy also, Dr. Watson. Not a word! You understand!"
  "Just as you wish."
  "They have treated me shamefully -- shamefully. When the facts
come out in Frankland v. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of
indignation will run through the country. Nothing would induce
me to help the police in any way. For all they cared it might
have been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned
at the stake. Surely you are not going! You will help me to
empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion!"
  But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading
him from his announced intention of walking home with me. I
kept the road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off
across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy
had disappeared. Everything was working in my favour, and I
swore that it should not be through lack of energy or persever-
ance that I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in
my way.
  The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the
hill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one
side and gray shadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the
farthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of
Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide expanse there was no
sound and no movement. One great gray bird, a gull or curlew,
soared aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the only
living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert
beneath it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the
mystery and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart.
The boy was nowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft
of the hills there was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the
middle of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to
act as a screen against the weather. My heart leaped within me as
I saw it. This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked. At
last my foot was on the threshold of his hiding place -- his secret
was within my grasp.
  As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would
do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I
satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habita-
tion. A vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated
opening which served as a door. All was silent within. The
unknown might be lurking there, or he might be prowling on the
moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of adventure. Throwing
aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt of my
revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked in. The
place was empty.
  But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false
scent. This was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets
rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which
neolithic man had once slumbered. The ashes of a fire were
heaped in a rude grate. Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a
bucket half-full of water. A litter of empty tins showed that the
place had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes
became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a
half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of
the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this
stood a small cloth bundle -- the same, no doubt, which I had
seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It
contained a loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of
preserved peaches. As I set it down again, after having examined
it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of
paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I read,
roughly scrawled in pencil: "Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe
Tracey."
  For a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking
out the meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir
Henry, who was being aogged by this secret man. He had not
followed me himself, but he had set an agent -- the boy, perhaps -- 
upon my track, and this was his report. Possibly I had taken no
step since I had been upon the moor which had not been observed
and reported. Always there was this feeling of an unseen force, a
fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy, holding
us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one
realized that one was indeed-entangled in its meshes.
  If there was one report there might be others, so I looked
round the hut in search of them. There was no trace, however, of
anything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which might
indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this
singular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits and cared
little for the comforts of life. When I thought of the heavy rains
and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and
immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that
inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by
chance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut
until I knew.
  Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing
with scarlet and gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy
patches by the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen
Mire. There were the two towers of Baskerville Hall, and there a
distant blur of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen.
Between the two, behind the hill, was the house of the Stapletons.
All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening
light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the
peace of Nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of
that interview which every instant was bringing nearer. With
tingling nerves but a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the
hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.
  And then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of
a boot striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another,
coming nearer and nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner
and cocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover
myself until I had an opportunity of seeing something of the
stranger. There was a long pause which showed that he had
stopped. Then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow
fell across the opening of the hut.
  "It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson," said a well-known
voice. "I really think that you will be more comfortable outside
than in."

                     Chapter 12
                 Death on the Moor

  For a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe
my ears. Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while
a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be
lifted from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice could
belong to but one man in all the world.
  "Holmes!" I cried -- "Holmes!"
  "Come out," said he, "and please be careful with the revolver."
  I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone
outside, his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon
my astonished features. He was thin and worn, but clear and
alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the
wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other
tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that catlike
love of personal cleanliness which was one of his characteristics,
that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he
were in Baker Street.
  "I never was more glad to see anyone in my life," said I as I
wrung him by the hand.
  "Or more astonished, eh?"
  "Well, I must confess to it."
  "The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no
idea that you had found my occasional retreat, still less that you
were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door."
  "My footprint, I presume?"
  "No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize
your footprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seri-
ously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for
when I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street,
I know that my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will
see it there beside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at that
supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut."
  "Exactly."
  "I thought as much -- and knowing your admirable tenacity I
was convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within
reach, waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought
that I was the criminal?"
  "I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find
out."
  "Excellent, Watson! And how did you localize me? You saw
me, perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so
imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?"
  "Yes, I saw you then."
  "And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to
this one?"
  "No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide
where to look."
  "The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not
make it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens."
He rose and peeped into the hut. "Ha, I see that Cartwright has
brought up some supplies. What's this paper? So you have been
to Coombe Tracey, have you?"
  "Yes."
  "To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?"
  "Exactly."
  "Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on
parallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall
have a fairly full knowledge of the case."
  "Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed
the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much
for my nerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come
here, and what have you been doing? I thought that you were in
Baker Street working out that case of blackmailing."
  "That was what I wished you to think."
  "Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!" I cried with
some bitterness. "I think that I have deserved better at your
hands, Holmes."
  "My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in
many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have
seemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your
own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger
which you ran which led me to come down and examine the
matter for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is
confident that my point of view would have been the same as
yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable
opponents to be on their guard. As it is, I have been able to get
about as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the
Hall, and I remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to
throw in all my weight at a critical moment."
  "But why keep me in the dark?"
  "For you to know could not have helped us and might possi-
bly have led to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me
something, or in your kindness you would have brought me out
some comfort or other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run.
I brought Cartwright down with me -- you remember the little
chap at the express office -- and he has seen after my simple
wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man want
more? He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active
pair of feet, and both have been invaluable."
  "Then my reports have all been wasted!" -- My voice trem-
bled as I recalled the pains and the pride with which I had
composed them.
  Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.
  "Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed,
I assure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only
delayed one day upon their way. I must compliment you ex-
ceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have
shown over an extraordinarily difficult case."
  I was still rather raw over the deception which had been
practised upon me, but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my
anger from my mind. I felt also in my heart that he was right in
what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I
should not have known that he was upon the moor.
  "That's better," said he, seeing the shadow rise from my
face. "And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura
Lyons -- it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her
that you had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one
person in Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the
matter. In fact, if you had not gone to-day it is exceedingly
probable that I should have gone to-morrow."
  The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air
had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There
sitting together in the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation
with the lady. So interested was he that I had to repeat some of it
twice before he was satisfied.
  "This is most important," said he when I had concluded. "It
fills up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most
complex affair. You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy
exists between this lady and the man Stapleton?"
  "I did not know of a close intimacy."
  "There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they
write, there is a complete understanding between them. Now,
this puts a very powerful weapon into our hands. If I could only
use it to detach his wife "
  "His wife?"
  "I am giving you some information now, in return for all that
you have given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss
Stapleton is in reality his wife."
  "Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How
could he have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?"
  "Sir Henry's falling in love could do no harm to anyone
except Sir Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not
make love to her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the
lady is his wife and not his sister."
  "But why this elaborate deception?"
  "Because he foresaw that she would be very much more
useful to him in the character of a free woman."
  All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly
took shape and centred upon the naturalist. In that impassive
colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed
to see something terrible -- a creature of infinite patience and
craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart.
  "It is he, then, who is our enemy -- it is he who dogged us in
London?"
  "So I read the riddle."
  "And the warning -- it must have come from her!"
  "Exactly."
  The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed,
loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long.
  "But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the
woman is his wife?"
  "Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of
autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I
dare say he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a
schoolmaster in the north of England. Now, there is no one more
easy to trace than a schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies
by which one may identify any man who has been in the
profession. A little investigation showed me that a school had
come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that the man
who had owned it -- the name was different -- had disappeared
with his wife. The descriptions agreed. When I learned that the
missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was
complete."
  The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the
shadows.
  "If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura
Lyons come in?" I asked.
  "That is one of the points upon which your own researches
have shed a light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the
situation very much. I did not know about a projected divorce
between herself and her husband. In that case, regarding Stapleton
as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming his
wife."
  "And when she is undeceived?"
  "Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our
first duty to see her -- both of us -- to-morrow. Don't you think,
Watson, that you are away from your charge rather long? Your
place should be at Baskerville Hall."
  The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had
settled upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a
violet sky.
  "One last question, Holmes," I said as I rose. "Surely there
is no need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning
of it all? What is he after?"
  Holmes's voice sank as he answered:
  "It is murder, Watson -- refined, cold-blooded, deliberate mur-
der. Do not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon
him, even as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is
already almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can
threaten us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do
so. Another day -- two at the most -- and I have my case com-
plete, but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond
mother watched her ailing child. Your mission to-day has justi-
fied itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his
side. Hark!"
  A terrible scream -- a prolonged yell of horror and anguish
burst out of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the
blood to ice in my veins.
  "Oh, my God!" I gasped. "What is it? What does it mean?"
  Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic
outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head
thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.
  "Hush!" he whispered. "Hush!"
  The cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had
pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it
burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.
  "Where is it?" Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill
of his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul.
"Where is it, Watson?"
  "There, I think." I pointed into the darkness.
  "No, there!"
  Again the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder
and much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a
deep, muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and
falling like the low, constant murmur of the sea.
  "The hound!" cried Holmes. "Come, Watson, come! Great
heavens, if we are too late!"
  He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had
followed at his heels. But now from somewhere among the
broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last
despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and
listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the
windless night.
  I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man dis-
tracted. He stamped his feet upon the ground.
  "He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late."
  "No, no, surely not!"
  "Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what
comes of abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst
has happened we'll avenge him!"
  Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boul-
ders, forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and
rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence
those dreadful sounds had come. At every rise Holmes looked
eagerly round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor,
and nothing moved upon its dreary face.
  "Can you see anything?"
  "Nothing."
  "But, hark, what is that?"
  A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon
our left! On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff
which overlooked a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was
spread-eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran towards it
the vague outline hardened into a definite shape. It was a pros-
trate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled
under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the
body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault.
So grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant
realize that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a
whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which
we stooped. Holmes laid his hand upon him and held it up again
with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which he
struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool
which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. And
it shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and
faint within us -- the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!
  There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar
ruddy tweed suit -- the very one which he had worn on the first
morning that we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the
one clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went
out, even as the hope had gone out of our souls. Holmes
groaned, and his face glimmered white through the darkness.
  "The brute! the brute!" I cried with clenched hands. "Oh
Holmes, I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his
fate."
  "I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my
case well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of
my client. It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my
career. But how could I know -- how could l know -- that he
would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my
warnings?"
  "That we should have heard his screams -- my God, those
screams! -- and yet have been unable to save him! Where is this
brute of a hound which drove him to his death? It may be lurking
among these rocks at this instant. And Stapleton, where is he?
He shall answer for this deed."
  "He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been
murdered -- the one frightened to death by the very sight of a
beast which he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his
end in his wild flight to escape from it. But now we have to
prove the connection between the man and the beast. Save from
what we heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the
latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. But, by
heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power
before another day is past!"
  We stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,
overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had
brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end.
Then as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over
which our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed
out over the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far
away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady
yellow light was shining. It could only come from the lonely
abode of the Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it
as I gazed.
  "Why should we not seize him at once?"
  "Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to
the last degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove.
If we make one false move the villain may escape us yet."
  "What can we do?"
  "There will be plenty for us to do to-morrow. To-night we
can only perform the last offices to our poor friend."
  Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and
approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones.
The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of
pain and blurred my eyes with tears.
  "We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the
way to the Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?"
  He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was
dancing and laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my
stern, self-contained friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!
  "A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!"
  "A beard?"
  "It is not the baronet -- it is -- why, it is my neighbour, the
convict!"
  With feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that
dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There
could be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal
eyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in
the light of the candle from over the rock -- the face of Selden,
the criminal.
  Then in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how
the baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to
Barrymore. Barrymore had passed it on in order to help Selden
in his escape. Boots, shirt, cap -- it was all Sir Henry's. The
tragedy was still black enough, but this man had at least de-
served death by the laws of his country. I told Holmes how the
matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.
  "Then the clothes have been the poor devil's death," said he.
"It is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some
article of Sir Henry's -- the boot which was abstracted in the
hotel, in all probability -- and so ran this man down. There is one
very singular thing, however: How came Selden, in the dark-
ness, to know that the hound was on his trail?"
  "He heard him."
  "To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man
like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk
recapture by screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must
have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track.
How did he know?"
  "A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that
all our conjectures are correct --"
  "I presume nothing."
  "Well, then, why this hound should be loose to-night. I
suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton
would not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry
would be there."
  "My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think
that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while
mine may remain forever a mystery. The question now is, what
shall we do with this poor wretch's body? We cannot leave it
here to the foxes and the ravens."
  "I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can
communicate with the police."
  "Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far.
Halloa, Watson, what's this? It's the man himself, by all that's
wonderful and audacious! Not a word to show yow suspicions --
not a word, or my plans crumble to the ground."
  A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull
red glow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could
distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist.
He stopped when he saw us, and then came on again.
  "Why, Dr. Watson, that's not you, is it? You are the last man
that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of
night. But, dear me, what's this? Somebody hurt? Not -- don't
tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!" He hurried past me and
stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath
and the cigar fell from his fingers.
  "Who -- who's this?" he stammered.
  "It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown."
  Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme
effort he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment.
He looked sharply from Holmes to me.
  "Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?"
  "He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these
rocks. My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we
heard a cry."
  "I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was
uneasy about Sir Henry."
  "Why about Sir Henry in particular?" I could not help asking.
  "Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he
did not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for
his safety when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way" -- his
eyes darted again from my face to Holmes's -- "did you hear
anything else besides a cry?"
  "No," said Holmes; "did you?"
  "No."
  "What do you mean, then?"
  "Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a
phantom hound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon
the moor. I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a
sound to-night."
  "We heard nothing of the kind," said I.
  "And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?"
  "I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him
off his head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and
eventually fallen over here and broken his neck."
  "That seems the most reasonable theory," said Stapleton, and
he gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. "What do you
think about it, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?"
  My friend bowed his compliments.
  "You are quick at identification," said he.
  "We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson
came down. You are in time to see a tragedy."
  "Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend's explanation
will cover the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back
to London with me to-morrow."
  "Oh, you return to-morrow?"
  "That is my intention."
  "I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences
which have puzzled us?"
  Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
  "One cannot always have the success for which one hopes.
An investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has
not been a satisfactory case."
  My friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned man-
ner. Stapleton still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.
  "I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it
would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in
doing it. I think that if we put something over his face he will be
safe until morning."
  And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton's offer of hospi-
tality, Holmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the
naturalist to return alone. Looking back we saw the figure mov-
ing slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one
black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man
was lying who had come so horribly to his end.

                       Chapter 13
                    Fixing the Nets

  "We're at close grips at last," said Holmes as we walked
together across the moor. "What a nerve the fellow has! How he
pulled himself together in the face of what must have been a
paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a
victim to his plot. I told you in London, Watson, and I tell you
now again, that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our
steel."
  "I am sorry that he has seen you."
  "And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it."
  "What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that
he knows you are here?"
  "It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to
desperate measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may
be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has
completely deceived us."
  "Why should we not arrest him at once?"
  "My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your
instinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for
argument's sake, that we had him arrested to-night, what on
earth the better off should we be for that? We could prove
nothing against him. There's the devilish cunning of it! If he
were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence,
but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would
not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master."
  "Surely we have a case."
  "Not a shadow of one -- only surmise and conjecture. We
should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and
such evidence."
  "There is Sir Charles's death."
  "Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that
he died of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him
but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What
signs are there of a hound? Where are the marks of its fangs? Of
course we know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that
Sir Charles was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we
have to prove all this, and we are not in a position to do it."
  "Well, then, to-night?"
  "We are not much better off to-night. Again, there was no
direct connection between the hound and the man's death. We
never saw the hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it
was running upon this man's trail. There is a complete absence
of motive. No, my dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves to
the fact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth our
while to run any risk in order to establish one."
  "And how do you propose to do so?"
  "I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us
when the position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my
own plan as well. Sufficient for to-morrow is the evil thereof;
but I hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last."
  I could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in
thought, as far as the Baskerville gates.
  "Are you coming up?"
  "Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last
word, Watson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him
think that Selden's death was as Stapleton would have us be-
lieve. He will have a better nerve for the ordeal which he will
have to undergo to-morrow, when he is engaged, if I remember
your report aright, to dine with these people."
  "And so am I."
  "Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That
will be easily arranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I
think that we are both ready for our suppers."
  Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock
Holmes, for he had for some days been expecting that recent
events would bring him down from London. He did raise his
eyebrows, however, when he found that my friend had neither
any luggage nor any explanations for its absence. Between us we
soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper we
explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed
desirable that he should know. But first I had the unpleasant duty
of breaking the news to Barrymore and his wife. To him it may
have been an unmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly in her
apron. To all the world he was the man of violence, half animal
and half demon; but to her he always remained the little wilful
boy of her own girlhood, the child who had clung to her hand.
Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him.
  "I've been moping in the house all day since Watson went off
in the morning," said the baronet. "I guess I should have some
credit, for I have kept my promise. If I hadn't sworn not to go
about alone I might have had a more lively evening, for I had a
message from Stapleton asking me over there."
  "I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively
evening," said Holmes drily. "By the way, I don't suppose you
appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having
broken your neck?"
  Sir Henry opened his eyes. "How was that?"
  "This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your
servant who gave them to him may get into trouble with the
police."
  "That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far
as I know."
  "That's lucky for him -- in fact, it's lucky for all of you, since
you are all on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not
sure that as a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest
the whole household. Watson's reports are most incriminating
documents."
  "But how about the case?" asked the baronet. "Have you
made anything out of the tangle? I don't know that Watson and I
are much the wiser since we came down."
  "I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation
rather more clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly
difficult and most complicated business. There are several points
upon which we still want light -- but it is coming all the same."
  "We've had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told
you. We heard the hound on the moor, so I can swear that it is
not all empty superstition. I had something to do with dogs when
I was out West, and I know one when I hear one. If you can
muzzle that one and put him on a chain I'll be ready to swear
you are the greatest detective of all time."
  "I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will
give me your help."
  "Whatever you tell me to do I will do."
  "Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without
always asking the reason."
  "Just as you like."
  "If you will do this I think the chances are that our little
problem will soon be solved. I have no doubt "
  He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into
the air. The lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so
still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classical statue, a
personification of alertness and expectation.
  "What is it?" we both cried.
  I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some
internal emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes
shone with amused exultation.
  "Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur," said he as he
waved his hand towards the line of portraits which covered the
opposite wall. "Watson won't allow that I know anything of art
but that is mere jealousy because our views upon the subject
differ. Now, these are a really very fine series of portraits."
  "Well, I'm glad to hear you say so," said Sir Henry, glancing
with some surprise at my friend. "I don't pretend to know much
about these things, and I'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer
than of a picture. I didn't know that you found time for such
things. "
  "I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That's a
Kneller, I'll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the
stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are
all family portraits, I presume?"
  "Every one."
  "Do you know the names?"
  "Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can
say my lessons fairly well."
  "Who is the gentleman with the telescope?"
  "That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney
in the West Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of
paper is Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Commit-
tees of the House of Commons under Pitt."
  "And this Cavalier opposite to me -- the one with the black
velvet and the lace?"
  "Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of
all the mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the
Baskervilles. We're not likely to forget him."
  I gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.
  "Dear me!" said Holmes, "he seems a quiet, meek-mannered
man enough, but I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his
eyes. I had pictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person."
  "There's no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the
date, 1647, are on the back of the canvas."
  Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer
seemed to have a fascination for him, and his eyes were continu-
ally fixed upon it during supper. It was not until later, when Sir
Henry had gone to his room, that I was able to follow the trend
of his thoughts. He led me back into the banqueting-hall, his
bedroom candle in his hand, and he held it up against the
time-stained portrait on the wall.
  "Do you see anything there?"
  I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the
white lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed
between them. lt was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim
hard, and stern, with a firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly
intolerant eye.
  "Is it like anyone you know?"
  "There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw."
  "Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!" He stood
upon a chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved
his right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.
  "Good heavens!" I cried in amazement.
  The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.
  "Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine
faces and not their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal
investigator that he should see through a disguise."
  "But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait."
  "Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which
appears to be both physical and spiritual. A study of family
portraits is enough to convert a man to the doctrine of reincarna-
tion. The fellow is a Baskerville -- that is evident."
  "With designs upon the succession."
  "Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one
of our most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we
have him, and I dare swear that before to-morrow night he will
be fluttering in our net as helpless as one of his own butterflies.
A pin, a cork, and a card, and we add him to the Baker Street
collection!" He burst into one of his rare fits of laughter as he
turned away from the picture. I have not heard him laugh often,
and it has always boded ill to somebody.
  I was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier
still, for I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.
  "Yes, we should have a full day to-day," he remarked, and
he rubbed his hands with the joy of action. "The nets are all in
place, and the drag is about to begin. We'll know before the day
is out whether we have caught our big, leanjawed pike, or
whether he has got through the meshes."
  "Have you been on the moor already?"
  "I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the
death of Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be
troubled in the matter. And I have also communicated with my
faithful Cartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the
door of my hut, as a dog does at his master's grave, if I had not
set his mind at rest about my safety."
  "What is the next move?"
  "To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!"
  "Good-morning, Holmes," said the baronet. "You look like
a general who is planning a battle with his chief of the staff."
  "That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders."
  "And so do I."
  "Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with
our friends the Stapletons to-night."
  "I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable
people, and I am sure that they would be very glad to see you."
  "I fear that Watson and I must go to London."
  "To London?"
  "Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the
present juncture."
  The baronet's face perceptibly lengthened.
  "I hoped that you were going to see me through this business.
The Hall and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is
alone."
  "My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly
what I tell you. You can tell your friends that we should have
been happy to have come with you, but that urgent business
required us to be in town. We hope very soon to return to
Devonshire. Will you remember to give them that message?"
  "If you insist upon it."
  "There is no alternative, I assure you."
  I saw by the baronet's clouded brow that he was deeply hurt
by what he regarded as our desertion.
  "When do you desire to go?" he asked coldly.
  "Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe
Tracey, but Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will
come back to you. Watson, you will send a note to Stapleton to
tell him that you regret that you cannot come."
  "I have a good mind to go to London with you," said the
baronet. "Why should I stay here alone?"
  "Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your
word that you would do as you were told, and I tell you to
stay."
  "All right, then, I'll stay."
  "One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House
Send back your trap, however, and let them know that you
intend to walk home."
  "To walk across the moor?"
  "Yes."
  "But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned
me not to do."
  "This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every
confidence in your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but
it is essential that you should do it."
  "Then I will do it."
  "And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any
direction save along the straight path which leads from Merripit
House to the Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home."
  "I will do just what you say."
  "Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after
breakfast as possible, so as to reach London in the afternoon."
  I was much astounded by this programme, though I remem-
bered that Holmes had said to Stapleton on the night before that
his visit would terminate next day. It had not crossed my mind
however, that he would wish me to go with him, nor could I
understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he
himself declared to be critical. There was nothing for it, how-
ever, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful
friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of
Coombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return
journey. A small boy was waiting upon the platform.
  "Any orders, sir?"
  "You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment
you arrive you will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my
name, to say that if he finds the pocketbook which I have
dropped he is to send it by registered post to Baker Street."
  "Yes, sir."
  "And ask at the station office if there is a message for me."
  The boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to
me. It ran:

      Wire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant.
    Arrive five-forty.
                                              Lestrade.

  "That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of
the professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now,
Watson, I think that we cannot employ our time better than by
calling upon your acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons."
  His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would
use the baronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were
really gone, while we should actually return at the instant when
we were likely to be needed. That telegram from London, if
mentioned by Sir Henry to the Stapletons, must remove the last
suspicions from their minds. Already I seemed to see our nets
drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.
  Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes
opened his interview with a frankness and directness which
considerably amazed her.
  "I am investigating the circumstances which attended the
death of the late Sir Charles Baskerville," said he. "My friend
here, Dr. Watson, has informed me of what you have communi-
cated, and also of what you have withheld in connection with
that matter."
  "What have I withheld?" she asked defiantly.
  "You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the
gate at ten o'clock. We know that that was the place and hour of
his death. You have withheld what the connection is between
these events."
  "There is no connection."
  "In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary
one. But I think that we shall succeed in establishing a connec-
tion, after all. I wish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons.
We regard this case as one of murder, and the evidence may
implicate not only your friend Mr. Stapleton but his wife as
well."
  The lady sprang from her chair.
  "His wife!" she cried.
  "The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for
his sister is really his wife."
  Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping
the arms of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned
white with the pressure of her grip.
  "His wife!" she said again. "His wife! He is not a married
man."
  Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
  "Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so --!"
The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.
  "I have come prepared to do so," said Holmes, drawing
several papers from his pocket. "Here is a photograph of the
couple taken in York four years ago. It is indorsed 'Mr. and
Mrs. Vandeleur,' but you will have no difficulty in recognizing
him, and her also, if you know her by sight. Here are three
written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and Mrs.
Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver's private school.
Read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people."
  She glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set
rigid face of a desperate woman.
  "Mr. Holmes," she said, "this man had offered me marriage
on condition that I could get a divorce from my husband. He has
lied to me, the villain, in every conceivable way. Not one word
of truth has he ever told me. And why -- why? I imagined that all
was for my own sake. But now I see that I was never anything
but a tool in his hands. Why should I preserve faith with him
who never kept any with me? Why should I try to shield him
from the consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what
you like, and there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing
I swear to you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never
dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman, who had been my
kindest friend."
  "I entirely believe you, madam," said Sherlock Holmes.
  "The recital of these events must be very painful to you, and
perhaps it will make it easier if I tell you what occurred, and you
can check me if I make any material mistake. The sending of this
letter was suggested to you by Stapleton?"
  "He dictated it."
  "I presume that the reason he gave was that you would
receive help from Sir Charles for the legal expenses connected
with your divorce?"
  "Exactly."
  "And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from
keeping the appointment?"
  "He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other
man should find the money for such an object, and that though
he was a poor man himself he would devote his last penny to
removing the obstacles which divided us."
  "He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you
heard nothing until you read the reports of the death in the
paper?"
  "No."
  "And he made you swear to say nothing about your appoint-
ment with Sir Charles?"
  "He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one,
and that I should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He
frightened me into remaining silent."
  "Quite so. But you had your suspicions?"
  She hesitated and looked down.
  "I knew him," she said. "But if he had kept faith with me I
should always have done so with him."
  "I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,"
said Sherlock Holmes. "You have had him in your power and he
knew it, and yet you are alive. You have been walking for some
months very near to the edge of a precipice. We must wish you
good-morning now, Mrs. Lyons, and it is probable that you will
very shortly hear from us again."

  "Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty
thins away in front of us," said Holmes as we stood waiting for
the arrival of the express from town. "I shall soon be in the
position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one
of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times.
Students of criminology will remember the analogous incidents in
Godno, in Little Russia, in the year '66, and of course there are
the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case possesses
some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no
clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much
surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night. "
  The London express came roaring into the station, and a
small, wiry bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class
carriage. We all three shook hands, and I saw at once from the
reverential way in which Lestrade gazed at my companion that
he had learned a good deal since the days when they had first
worked together. I could well remember the scorn which the
theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the practical man.
  "Anything good?" he asked.
  "The biggest thing for years," said Holmes. "We have two
hours before we need think of starting. I think we might employ
it in getting some dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the
London fog out of your throat by giving you a breath of the pure
night air of Dartmoor. Never been there? Ah, well, I don't
suppose you will forget your first visit."

                      Chapter 14
              The Hound of the Baskervilles

  One of Sherlock Holmes's defects -- if, indeed, one may call it a
defect -- was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his
full plans to any other person until the instant of their fulfilment.
Partly it came no doubt from his own masterful nature, which
loved to dominate and surprise those who were around him.
Partly also from his professional caution, which urged him never
to take any chances. The result, however, was very trying for
those who were acting as his agents and assistants. I had often
suffered under it, but never more so than during that long drive
in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we
were about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said
nothing, and I could only surmise what his course of action
would be. My nerves thrilled with anticipation when at last the
cold wind upon our faces and the dark, void spaces on either side
of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the moor
once again. Every stride of the horses and every turn of the
wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.
  Our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver
of the hired wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial
matters when our nerves were tense with emotion and anticipa-
tion. It was a relief to me, after that unnatural restraint, when we
at last passed Frankland's house and knew that we were drawing
near to the Hall and to the scene of action. We did not drive up
to the door but got down near the gate of the avenue. The
wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe Tracey
forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House.
  "Are you armed, Lestrade?"
  The little detective smiled.
  "As long as I have my trousers I have a hip-pocket, and as
long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it."
  "Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies."
  "You're mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What's
the game now?"
  "A waiting game."
  "My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place," said the
detective with a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes
of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the
Grimpen Mire. "I see the lights of a house ahead of us."
  "That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must
request you to walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper."
  We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for
the house, but Holmes halted us when we were about two
hundred yards from it.
  "This will do," said he. "These rocks upon the right make an
admirable screen."
  "We are to wait here?"
  "Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this
hollow, Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not,
Watson? Can you tell the position of the rooms? What are those
latticed windows at this end?"
  "I think they are the kitchen windows."
  "And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?"
  "That is certainly the dining-room."
  "The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep
forward quietly and see what they are doing -- but for heaven's
sake don't let them know that they are watched!"
  I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which
surrounded the stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached
a point whence I could look straight through the uncurtained
window.
  There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton.
They sat with their profiles towards me on either side of the
round table. Both of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and
wine were in front of them. Stapleton was talking with anima-
tion, but the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought
of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing
heavily upon his mind.
  As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir
Henry filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing
at his cigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of
boots upon gravel. The steps passed along the path on the other
side of the wall under which I crouched. Looking over, I saw the
naturalist pause at the door of an out-house in the corner of the
orchard. A key turned in a lock, and as he passed in there was a
curious scuffling noise from within. He was only a minute or so
inside, and then I heard the key turn once more and he passed
me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his guest, and I
crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to tell
them what I had seen.
  "You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?" Holmes asked
when I had finished my report.
  "No."
  "Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other
room except the kitchen?"
  "I cannot think where she is."
  I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a
dense, white fog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and
banked itself up like a wall on that side of us, low but thick and
well defined. The moon shone on it, and it looked like a great
shimmering ice-field, with the heads of the distant tors as rocks
borne upon its surface. Holmes's face was turned towards it, and
he muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift.
  "It's moving towards us, Watson."
  "Is that serious?"
  "Very serious, indeed -- the one thing upon earth which could
have disarranged my plans. He can't be very long, now. It is
already ten o'clock. Our success and even his life may depend
upon his coming out before the fog is over the path."
  The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold
and bright, while a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft,
uncertain light. Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its
serrated roof and bristling chimneys hard outlined against the
silver-spangled sky. Broad bars of golden light from the lower
windows stretched across the orchard and the moor. One of them
was suddenly shut off. The servants had left the kitchen. There
only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the two men,
the muderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted over
their cigars.
  Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half
of the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house. Already
the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of
the lighted window. The farther wall of the orchard was already
invisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white
vapour. As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round
both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank
on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship
upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon
the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience.
  "If he isn't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be
covered. In half an hour we won't be able to see our hands in
front of us."
  "Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?"
  "Yes, I think it would be as well."
  So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until
we were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white
sea, with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and
inexorably on.
  "We are going too far," said Holmes. "We dare not take the
chance of his being overtaken before he can reach us. At all
costs we must hold our ground where we are." He dropped on
his knees and clapped his ear to the ground. "Thank God, I
think that I hear him coming."
  A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouch-
ing among the stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank
in front of us. The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as
through a curtain, there stepped the man whom we were await-
ing. He looked round him in surprise as he emerged into the
clear, starlit night. Then he came swiftly along the path, passed
close to where we lay, and went on up the long slope behind us.
As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder, like a
man who is ill at ease.
  "Hist!" cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cock-
ing pistol. "Look out! It's coming!"
  There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in
the heart of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards
of where we lay, and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what
horror was about to break from the heart of it. I was at Holmes's
elbow, and I glanced for an instant at his face. It was pale and
exultant, his eyes shining brightly in the moonlight. But sud-
denly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare, and his lips
parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade gave a yell of
terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground. I
sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind
paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us
from the shadows of the fog. A hound it was, an enormous
coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever
seen. Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a
smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were
outlined in flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of a
disordered brain could anything more savage, more appalling,
more hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face
which broke upon us out of the wall of fog.
  With long bounds the huge black creatwe was leaping down
the track, following hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So
paralyzed were we by the apparition that we allowed him to pass
before we had recovered our nerve. Then Holmes and I both
fired together, and the creature gave a hideous howl, which
showed that one at least had hit him. He did not pause, however,
but bounded onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry
looking back, his face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in
horror, glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunt-
ing him down.
  But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to
the winds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could
wound him we could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as
Holmes ran that night. I am reckoned fleet of foot, but he
outpaced me as much as I outpaced the little professional. In
front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream
from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound. I was in time to
see the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him to the ground, and
worry at his throat. But the next instant Holmes had emptied five
barrels of his revolver into the creature's flank. With a last
howl of agony and a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its
back, four feet pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its
side. I stooped, panting, and pressed my pistol to the dreadful,
shimmering head, but it was useless to press the trigger. The
giant hound was dead.
  Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away
his collar, and Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we
saw. that there was no sign of a wound and that the rescue had
been in time. Already our friend's eyelids shivered and he made
a feeble effort to move. Lestrade thrust his brandy-flask between
the baronet's teeth, and two frightened eyes were looking up at
us.
  "My God!" he whispered. "What was it? What, in heaven's
name, was it?"
  "It's dead, whatever it is," said Holmes. "We've laid the
family ghost once and forever."
  In mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was
lying stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it
was not a pure mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the
two -- gaunt, savage, and as large as a small lioness. Even now
in the stillness of death, the huge jaws seemed to be dripping
with a bluish flame and the small, deep-set, cruel eyes were
ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the glowing muzzle, and
as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and gleamed in the
darkness.
  "Phosphorus," I said.
  "A cunning preparation of it," said Holmes, sniffing at the
dead animal. "There is no smell which might have interfered
with his power of scent. We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry,
for having exposed you to this fright. I was prepared for a
hound, but not for such a creature as this. And the fog gave us
little time to receive him."
  "You have saved my life."
  "Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?"
  "Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready
for anything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you
propose to do?"
  "To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures
to-night. If you will wait, one or other of us will go back with
you to the Hall."
  He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and
trembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he sat
shivering with his face buried in his hands.
  "We must leave you now," said Holmes. "The rest of our
work must be done, and every moment is of importance. We
have our case, and now we only want our man.
  "It's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,"
he continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path.
"Those shots must have told him that the game was up."
  "We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened
them."
  "He followed the hound to call him off -- of that you may be
certain. No, no, he's gone by this time! But we'll search the
house and make sure."
  The front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from
room to room to the amazement of a doddering old manservant,
who met us in the passage. There was no light save in the
dining-room, but Holmes caught up the lamp and left no corner
of the house unexplored. No sign could we see of the man whom
we were chasing. On the upper floor, however, one of the
bedroom doors was locked.
  "There's someone in here," cried Lestrade. "I can hear a
movement. Open this door!"
  A faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck
the door just over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew
open. Pistol in hand, we all three rushed into the room.
  But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant
villain whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an
object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment
staring at it in amazement.
  The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the
walls were lined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that
collection of butterflies and moths the formation of which had
been the relaxation of this complex and dangerous man. In the
centre of this room there was an upright beam, which had been
placed at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk
of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a figure was tied,
so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been used to
secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was
that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat
and was secured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the
lower part of the face, and over it two dark eyes -- eyes full of
grief and shame and a dreadful questioning -- stared back at us.
In a minute we had torn off the gag, unswathed the bonds, and
Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us. As her
beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a
whiplash across her neck.
  "The brute!" cried Holmes. "Here, Lestrade, your brandy-
bottle! Put her in the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and
exhaustion."
  She opened her eyes again.
  "Is he safe?" she asked. "Has he escaped?"
  "He cannot escape us, madam."
  "No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?"
  "Yes."
  "And the hound?"
  "It is dead."
  She gave a long sigh of satisfaction.
  "Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has
treated me!" She shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we
saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises. "But
this is nothing -- nothing! It is my mind and soul that he has
tortured and defiled. I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a
life of deception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the
hope that I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have
been his dupe and his tool." She broke into passionate sobbing
as she spoke.
  "You bear him no good will, madam," said Holmes. "Tell us
then where we shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil,
help us now and so atone."
  "There is but one place where he can have fled," she an-
swered. "There is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the
mire. It was there that he kept his hound and there also he had
made preparations so that he might have a refuge. That is where
he would fly."
  The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes
held the lamp towards it.
  "See," said he. "No one could find his way into the Grimpen
Mire to-night."
  She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed
with fierce merriment
  "He may find his way in, but never out," she cried. "How
can he see the guiding wands to-night? We planted them to-
gether, he and I, to mark the pathway through the mire. Oh, if I
could only have plucked them out to-day. Then indeed you
would have had him at your mercy!"
  It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog
had lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the
house while Holmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville
Hall. The story of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld
from him, but he took the blow bravely when he learned the
truth about the woman whom he had loved. But the shock of the
night's adventures had shattered his nerves, and before morning
he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of Dr. Mortimer.
The two of them were destined to travel together round the world
before Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man
that he had been before he became master of that ill-omened
estate.

  And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular
narrative, in which I have tried to make the reader share those
dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long
and ended in so tragic a manner. On the morning after the death
of the hound the fog had lifted and we were guided by Mrs.
Stapleton to the point where they had found a pathway through
the bog. It helped us to realize the horror of this woman's life
when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on
her husband's track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula
of firm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog.
From the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed
where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those
green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to
the stranger. Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an
odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic vapour onto our faces,
while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the
dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations
around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as we
walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant
hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim
and purposeful was the clutch in which it held us. Once only we
saw a trace that someone had passed that perilous way before us.
From amid a tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the
slime some dark thing was projecting. Holmes sank to his waist
as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we not been there
to drag him out he could never have set his foot upon firm land
again. He held an old black boot in the air. "Meyers, Toronto,"
was printed on the leather inside.
  "It is worth a mud bath," said he. "It is our friend Sir
Henry's missing boot."
  "Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight."
  "Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the
hound upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up,
still clutching it. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight.
We know at least that he came so far in safety."
  But more than that we were never destined to know, though
there was much which we might surmise. There was no chance
of finding footsteps in the mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly
in upon them, but as we at last reached firmer ground beyond the
morass we all looked eagerly for them. But no slightest sign of
them ever met our eyes. If the earth told a true story, then
Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards which he
struggled through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in the
heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the
huge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-
hearted man is forever buried.
  Many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he
had hid his savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft
half-filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned
mine. Beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the
miners, driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding
swamp. In one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of
gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined. A
skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the
debris.
  "A dog!" said Holmes. "By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor
Mortimer will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that
this place contains any secret which we have not already fath-
omed. He could hide his hound, but he could not hush its voice,
and hence came those cries which even in daylight were not
pleasant to hear. On an emergency he could keep the hound in
the out-house at Merripit, but it was always a risk, and it was
only on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end of all his
efforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no doubt the
luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was
suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and
by the desire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the
poor devil of a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did,
and as we ourselves might have done, when he saw such a
creature bounding through the darkness of the moor upon his
track. It was a cunning device, for, apart from the chance of
driving your victim to his death, what peasant would venture to
inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight of it,
as many have done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson,
and I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt
down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder" -- he
swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green-
splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the
russet slopes of the moor.

                        Chapter 15
                     A Retrospection

  It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw
and foggy night, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-
room in Baker Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to
Devonshire he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost
importance, in the first of which he had exposed the atrocious
conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection with the famous card
scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second he had
defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge of
murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her
step-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will be
remembered, was found six months later alive and married in
New York. My friend was in excellent spirits over the success
which had attended a succession of difficult and important cases,
so that I was able to induce him to discuss the details of the
Baskerville mystery. I had waited patiently for the opportunity
for I was aware that he would never permit cases to overlap, and
that his clear and logical mind would not be drawn from its
present work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir Henry and
Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that
long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of
his shattered nerves. They had called upon us that very after-
noon, so that it was natural that the subject should come up for
discussion.
  "The whole course of events," said Holmes, "from the point
of view of the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and
direct, although to us, who had no means in the beginning of
knowing the motives of his actions and could only learn part of
the facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex. I have had the
advantage of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton, and the
case has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that
there is anything which has remained a secret to us. You will
find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my
indexed list of cases."
  "Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of
events from memory."
  "Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts
in my mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of
blotting out what has passed. The barrister who has his case at
his fingers' ends and is able to argue with an expert upon his
own subject finds that a week or two of the courts will drive it all
out of his head once more. So each of my cases displaces the
last, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my recollection of Baskerville
Hall. To-morrow some other little problem may be submitted to
my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French lady and
the infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes,
however, I will give you the course of events as nearly as I can,
and you will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.
  "My inquiries show beyond all question that the family por-
trait did not lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He
was a son of that Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir
Charles, who fled with a sinister reputation to South America,
where he was said to have died unmarried. He did, as a matter of
fact, marry, and had one child, this fellow, whose real name is
the same as his father's. He married Beryl Garcia, one of the
beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a considerable
sum of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and
fled to England, where he established a school in the east of
Yorkshire. His reason for attempting this special line of business
was that he had struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive
tutor upon the voyage home, and that he had used this man's
ability to make the undertaking a success. Fraser, the tutor, died
however, and the school which had begun well sank from disre-
pute into infamy. The Vandeleurs found it convenient to change
their name to Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his
fortune, his schemes for the future, and his taste for entomology
to the south of England. I learned at the British Museum that he
was a recognized authority upon the subject, and that the name
of Vandeleur has been permanently attached to a certain moth
which he had, in his Yorkshire days, been the first to describe.
  "We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to
be of such intense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made
inquiry and found that only two lives intervened between him
and a valuable estate. When he went to Devonshire his plans
were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but that he meant mischief
from the first is evident from the way in which he took his wife
with him in the character of his sister. The idea of using her as a
decoy was clearly already in his mind, though he may not have
been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He
meant in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any
tool or run any risk for that end. His first act was to establish
himself as near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second
was to cultivate a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and
with the neighbours.
  "The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so
prepared the way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue
to call him, knew that the old man's heart was weak and that a
shock would kill him. So much he had learned from Dr. Morti-
mer. He had heard also that Sir Charles was superstitious and
had taken this grim legend very seriously. His ingenious mind
instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could be done to
death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the guilt
to the real murderer.
  "Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with
considerable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been
content to work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means
to make the creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his
part. The dog he bought in London from Ross and Mangles, the
dealers in Fulham Road. It was the strongest and most savage in
their possession. He brought it down by the North Devon line
and walked a great distance over the moor so as to get it home
without exciting any remarks. He had already on his insect hunts
learned to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a safe
hiding-place for the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited his
chance.
  "But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be
decoyed outside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapleton
lurked about with his hound, but without avail. It was during
these fruitless quests that he, or rather his ally, was seen by
peasants, and that the legend of the demon dog received a new
confirmation. He had hoped that his wife might lure Sir Charles
to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly independent. She
would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in a senti-
mental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy.
Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her.
She would have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton
was at a deadlock.
  "He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance
that Sir Charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made
him the minister of his charity in the case of this unfortunate
woman, Mrs. Laura Lyons. By representing himself as a single
man he acquired complete influence over her, and he gave her to
understand.that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her
husband he would marry her. His plans were suddenly brought to
a head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the
Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he
himself pretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim
might get beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon
Mrs. Lyons to write this letter, imploring the old man to give her
an interview on the evening before his departure for London. He
then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so
had the chance for which he had waited.
  "Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in
time to get his hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to
bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to
expect that he would find the old gentleman waiting. The dog,
incited by its master, sprang over the wicket-gate and pursued
the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming down the yew alley.
In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight
to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing
eyes, bounding after its victim. He fell dead at the end of the
alley from heart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the
grassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that
no track but the man's was visible. On seeing him lying still the
creature had probably approached to sniff at him, but finding
him dead had turned away again. It was then that it left the print
which was actually observed by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was
called off and hurried away to its lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a
mystery was left which puzzled the authorities, alarmed the
countryside, and finally brought the case within the scope of our
observation.
  "So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You
perceive the devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost
impossible to make a case against the real murderer. His only
accomplice was one who could never give him away, and the
grotesque, inconceivable nature of the device only served to
make it more effective. Both of the women concerned in the
case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left with a
strong suspicion against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he
had designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the
hound. Mrs. Lyons knew neither of these things, but had been
impressed by the death occurring at the time of an uncancelled
appointment which was only known to him. However, both of
them were under his influence, and he had nothing to fear from
them. The first half of his task was successfully accomplished
but the more difficult still remained.
  "It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of
an heir in Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from
his friend Dr. Mortimer, and he was told by the latter all details
about the arrival of Henry Baskerville. Stapleton's first idea was
that this young stranger from Canada might possibly be done to
death in London without coming down to Devonshire at all. He
distrusted his wife ever since she had refused to help him in
laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not leave her long out
of his sight for fear he should lose his influence over her. It was
for this reason that he took her to London with him. They
lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven
Street, which was actually one of those called upon by my agent
in search of evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her
room while he, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to
Baker Street and afterwards to the station and to the North-
umberland Hotel. His wife had some inkling of his plans; but she
had such a fear of her husband -- a fear founded upon brutal
ill-treatment -- that she dare not write to warn the man whom she
knew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into Stapleton's
hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we know,
she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would
form the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand.
It reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his
danger.
  "It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir
Henry's attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he
might always have the means of setting him upon his track. With
characteristic promptness and audacity he set about this at once,
and we cannot doubt that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel
was well bribed to help him in his design. By chance, however,
the first boot which was procured for him was a new one and,
therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had it returned and
obtained another -- a most instructive incident, since it proved
conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,
as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an
old boot and this indifference to a new one. The more outre and
grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be
examined, and the very point which appears to complicate a case
is, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the one
which is most likely to elucidate it.
  "Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shad-
owed always by Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our
rooms and of my appearance, as well as from his general con-
duct, I am inclined to think that Stapleton's career of crime has
been by no means limited to this single Baskerville affair. It is
suggestive that during the last three years there have been four
considerable burglaries in the west country, for none of which
was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at Folkestone
Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling of
the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I
cannot doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this
fashion, and that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous
man.
  "We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning
when he got away from us so successfully, and also of his
audacity in sending back my own name to me through the
cabman. From that moment he understood that I had taken over
the case in London, and that therefore there was no chance for
him there. He returned to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival of
the baronet."
  "One moment!" said I. "You have, no doubt, described the
sequence of events correctly, but there is one point which you
have left unexplained. What became of the hound when its
master was in London?"
  "I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubt-
edly of importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had
a confidant, though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in
his power by sharing all his plans with him. There was an old
manservant at Merripit House, whose name was Anthony. His
connection with the Stapletons can be traced for several years, as
far back as the schoolmastering days, so that he must have been
aware that his master and mistress were really husband and wife.
This man has disappeared and has escaped from the country. It is
suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,
while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American coun-
tries. The man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English,
but with a curious lisping accent. I have myself seen this old
man cross the Grimpen Mire by the path which Stapleton had
marked out. It is very probable, therefore, that in the absence of
his master it was he who cared for the hound, though he may
never have known the purpose for which the beast was used.
  "The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they
were soon followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to
how I stood myself at that time. It may possibly recur to your
memory that when I examined the paper upon which the printed
words were fastened I made a close inspection for the water-
mark. In doing so I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and
was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white
jessamine. There are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very
necessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish
from each other, and cases have more than once within my own
experience depended upon their prompt recognition. The scent
suggested the presence of a lady, and already my thoughts began
to turn towards the Stapletons. Thus I had made certain of the
hound, and had guessed at the criminal before ever we went to
the west country.
  "It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, how-
ever, that I could not do this if I were with you, since he would
be keenly on his guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, your-
self included, and I came down secretly when I was supposed to
be in London. My hardships were not so great as you imagined,
though such trifling details must never interfere with the investi-
gation of a case. I stayed for the most part at Coombe Tracey,
and only used the hut upon the moor when it was necessary to be
near the scene of action. Cartwright had come down with me,
and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance to
me. I was dependent upon him for food and clean linen. When I
was watching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently watching
you, so that I was able to keep my hand upon all the strings.
  "I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly,
being forwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey.
They were of great service to me, and especially that one inci-
dentally truthful piece of biography of Stapleton's. I was able to
establish the identity of the man and the woman and knew at last
exactly how I stood. The case had been considerably compli-
cated through the incident of the escaped convict and the rela-
tions between him and the Barrymores. This also you cleared up
in a very effective way, though I had already come to the same
conclusions from my own observations.
  "By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a
complete knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case
which could go to a jury. Even Stapleton's attempt upon Sir
Henry that night which ended in the death of the unfortunate
convict did not help us much in proving murder against our man.
There seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed,
and to do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently
unprotected, as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a severe
shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and
driving Stapleton to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have
been exposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach to my
management of the case, but we had no means of foreseeing the
terrible and paralyzing spectacle which the beast presented, nor
could we predict the fog which enabled him to burst upon us at
such short notice. We succeeded in our object at a cost which
both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me will be a tempo-
rary one. A long journey may enable our friend to recover not
only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feel-
ings. His love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him the
saddest part of all this black business was that he should have
been deceived by her.
  "It only remains to indicate the part which she had played
throughout. There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an
influence over her which may have been love or may have been
fear, or very possibly both, since they are by no means incom-
patible emotions. It was, at least, absolutely effective. At his
command she consented to pass as his sister, though he found
the limits of his power over her when he endeavoured to make
her the direct accessory to murder. She was ready to warn Sir
Henry so far as she could without implicating her husband, and
again and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to
have been capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet
paying court to the lady, even though it was part of his own
plan, still he could not help interrupting with a passionate out-
burst which revealed the fiery soul which his self-contained
manner so cleverly concealed. By encouraging the intimacy he
made it certain that Sir Henry would frequently come to Merripit
House and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity
which he desired. On the day of the crisis, however, his wife
turned suddenly against him. She had learned something of the
death of the convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept
in the outhouse on the evening that Sir Henry was coming to
dinner. She taxed her husband with his intended crime, and a
furious scene followed in which he showed her for the first time
that she had a rival in his love. Her fidelity turned in an instant
to bitter hatred, and he saw that she would betray him. He tied
her up, therefore, that she might have no chance of warning Sir
Henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside
put down the baronet's death to the curse of his family, as they
certainly would do, he could win his wife back to accept an
accomplished fact and to keep silent upon what she knew. In this
I fancy that in any case he made a miscalculation, and that, if we
had not been there, his doom would none the less have been
sealed. A woman of Spanish blood does not condone such an
irjury so lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without referring to
my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of this
curious case. I do not know that anything essential has been left
unexplained."
  "He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had
done the old uncle with his bogie hound."
  "The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did
not frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the
resistance which might be offered."
  "No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton
came into the succession, how could he explain the fact that he,
the heir, had been living unannounced under another name so
close to the property? How could he claim it without causing
suspicion and inquiry?"
  "It is a fomlidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much
when you expect me to solve it. The past and the present are
within the field of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the
future is a hard question to answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her
husband discuss the problem on several occasions. There were
three possible courses. He might claim the property from South
America, establish his identity before the British authorities there
and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to England at all,
or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the short time that
he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish an accomplice
with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir, and retaining
a claim upon some proportion of his income. We cannot doubt
from what we know of him that he would have found some way
out of the difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have had
some weeks of severe work, and for one evening, I think, we
may turn our thoughts into more pleasant channels. I have a box
for 'Les Huguenots.' Have you heard the De Reszkes? Might I
trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we can stop at
Marcini's for a little dinner on the way?"

From:  Muy Groso
To:    To All You Floobs...
Subj:  The Cube of Shalube...By Dr. Muess

 In the far away land of South FLoobalube
 Lived the lovers of something, known as the Floobs.
 They knew what was right, they knew what was wrong
 Cause they studied their cubes all say and night long.
 The jiggled and quiggled, and learned it by heart,
 Preached and screached it from every K-Mart.
 Whenever they wished, they reached in their tube
 And wiggled and waggled their cubes of Shalube.

 Each FLoob got their cube on the day they were born
 Which they kept in a tube, on their rear dorsal horn.
 They had real nice clothes, and all drove Corvettes,
 Mostly Floob-boys, but sometimes Floobettes!
 They turned a deaf ear to every suggestion
 For they knew every answer to every Floob-question.
 They thought very little so were only upset
 When someone rebelled, or their clothing got wet.

 They worked in Floob factories, making tube-guns
 The made them for money, Floob-dads and Floob-moms.
 Tube-guns made them strong, and kept them all free,
 Free to tell others what they ought to be.
 The Cube of Shalube was in every Floob-tube
 So nothing else mattered in South Floobalube.
 But a little ways North, in Snublebooblube
 Dwelled those without cubes, who were known as the Snubes.

 These Snublebooblubers had a rear tube
 But sadly for them, it held no Floob-cube.
 Some had tri-angles, and some had small pyramids,
 Some just had boxes, and some dodechehedrons.
 Some had large ovals, some had a ball,
 Some had a cone, and some nothing at all!
 Snubes loved one another, and always were taught
 To judge by ones actions, and not what one thought.

 The Snubes liked to dance and sing Rock and Roll
 Doing funky snube-steps at the Super Snube Bowl.
 They twiggled their tubes, without feeling shame
 Not even guilty, twas just a Snube-game.
 Snubes helped one another through hard times and bad,
 No matter their tube-shape, with whatever they had.
 Then the day before Tuesday, at six eighty-nine
 Every Floobluber stood on the Snubleboob-line.

 "You all must have cubes in every Snube-tube
 No other shapes but our Cube of Shalube.
 We've turned and learned it, we hold it each day
 Don't do as we do, just do as we say!
 You Snubes are all bad, there isn't much doubt
 Every Floob knows what we're talking about.
 If you don't take these cubes, like all us good Floobs
 You'll suffer and die, each one of you Snubes!"

 They shouted Snube-rants, and made rude-Floob-chants
 While all the Snubes sang or pulled down their pants!
 "We came from down South to help you Snubes out
 And what do we get but Snubes jumping about!
 We're doing what is right, and you're doing it wrong
 We don't like your shapes, we don't like your songs!
 So take these cubes now, it's your last chance,
 And for Shalube's sake...PLEASE PULL UP YOUR PANTS!"

 Each Snubleboobluber liked each own's shape,
 Things were just fine, there was nothing to hate.
 "Our tubes feel just great, without guns or cubes
 What is the matter with all of you Floobs?
 We Snubes are too busy to hate and to fight
 We've been working all day DOING what is right.
 So why don't you Floobs, just leave us alone
 And take all your cubes, and get off on home!"

 The Floobs got all mad, and ranted and raved
 "You don't understand, YOU NEED TO BE SAVED!"
 So with their hands in their tubes, clutching their cubes,
 They stood on their heads and prayed to Shalube.
 Then every Floobluber took out a gun,
 And shot all the Snubes, every last one.
 Then they took all the shapes, from every Snube-tube
 And burned them all up, along with the Snubes.

 In South Floobalube, no Floob was ashamed,
 For now every thought, was one in the same.
 Then on a day just like this, from far in the sky
 Great Shalube appeared with ire in his eye.
 "You miffed it, you muffed it, TURN IN YOUR CUBES,
 Now suffer and die, each one of you Floobs!"
 Then he bit off their heads, and popped all their tubes
 And went on his way...with all the ghost-Snubes....

 Though no one was left to see the Snubes dance.
 Shalube still told them to PULL UP THEIR PANTS!

=========================================================================================

 =*= CURIOUS GEORGIE =*= Typed by THE PENGUIN of SubZero PAE 804 973-3644 =*=

INTRO:  I consider this story the best short story I have ever read.  I think
        you'll feel the same after reading it.  It comes from a College Humor
        book entitled "Hellbent on Insanity".

Georgie is a little monkey.  He lives in the house of the man with the orange
hat. All monkeys are curious.  But no monkey is as curious as Georgie.  That is
why his name is Curious Georgie.
        "I have to splivQ!++9c&	RaXid the main with the orange hat. "Be a
good little monkey while I am out.  Try some of the colombian I bought for you
until I come home.  Just don't get too curious, you little monkey."  And the
man went out.
        It was a lit of fun for Georgie to smoke the pot the man left for him.
He smoked a little, and then a little more, and then a little more, and then
a little more.
        Georgie got very high.  And he felt very good.  He began to do a lot of
tricks.  He even did a little dance.
        Georgie wanted to broaden his horizons.  Where did the man keep his 
acid?  Georgie was curious.
        He looked all over the house.  There was a closet in the room.  Georgie
looked through the closet for the acid.  He found a lot of things in there. 
But he did not find the man's acid.  Georgie looked for it here and looked for
it there. Where was the acid?  Georgie took all the drawers out of the dresser.
He took all the toys out of the toy box.  Georgie looked everywhere.  But he
could not find the acid.
      The room was a mess.  Georgie sat down.  He had been a bad little monkey.
Why was he always so curious?  Why did he make such a mess of the room?  His
trumpet was on the floor.  His racing cars and building blocks were all over.
Now he had to clean up the room and he could not trip.  The marijuana made
Georgie hungry.
        Georgie got up.  He had to have something to eat.  Matbe there was some
food in the refrigerator.  Georgie went to the kitchen to look.  Yes, there was
something to eat and it was something good too.  It was a sugar cube.
       Georgie took the sugar cube and went back in to the other room.  Georgie
sat down and ate the sugar cube.  Soon he began to see colors.  Then he looked
around. The room wavered back and forth.  Georgie turned on the man's record
player.  He put on a record by Jimi Hendrix. Georgie felt unusual.  He could
taste the music.  Soon he began to imagine he was a banana.  He did not want
anyone to peel him, so he hid under the bed.  This was good acid.
        Soon the man in the orange hat came back with a fat lady.  "What a
mess," said the man.  Georgie was hding under the bed.  "Where is Georgie?"
asked the man.  "Maybe you should go out and look for him," suggested the
lady.  "I'll wait...."
        The man did not want to hear any more.  He ran to his car and hopped
in.  "I'm going to kill that little fellow," he said.  Georgie stayed under
the bed.
        The lady did not see Georgie.  She took off her clother< turned out the
light, and got in the bed to wait for the man with the orange hat.  Georgie had
seen this lady before.  But now she was a bright shade of red.  This was good
acid.  Georgie had seen the man in the orange hat in bed with this lady before.
He was curious.  Georgie crawled out from under the bed.  What if the man came
back?  Maybe he would never come back.
        The lady had fallen asleep.  Georgie climbed into the bed.  She woke
up.  But the room was dark so she could not see.  "Orange hat man, you're 
back," said the lady.  Georgie could not talk so he did not say anything.
"Gee, you're like a monkey in bed," said the lady. "Ooh, ooh, ooh."  Georgie
liked the lady.  The acid was good too.
        Just then the man with the orange hat cam back.  He turned on the
light and saw Georgie and the lady getting down.  "Georgie," screamed the man.
"I'm going to blow your brains out."  The man opened a drawer and took out his
gun.  Georgie would never, never be curious again.

                                        New Story
=========================================================================================
 this story should be read while listening
 to `Lorelei' by the Cocteau Twins.

 There is a knock at the front door.  I rush to open it,  because
I know who it will be...  you stand there,  with an overnight bag
full of Reeboks slung over your shoulder and the weary expression
of the seasoned bus-traveler draped over your features.  You rush
into my arms,  almost knocking me over, and as we kiss, I murmur,
 `Oh  Mark...  I'm so  relieved  that you're here...'  and, for a
while after that, there is no need for words.

 Somewhat  later,  we  are  sitting  cross-legged  under the huge
dining-room table,  trying to reduce my parents' liquor supply to
zero.
 `Would you  like some more  Kahlua in that milk?' I ask, holding
 up the bottle (which is still half-full).
`You're trying to get me drunk,  aren't you?'  You smile as I top
up the tall glass  until the fluid  is the colour of  dark  swiss
chocolate.  I force it to your lips.
 `Come on,  skull it, SKULL IT!' after a brief struggle with only
about a tablespoon's-worth of liqueur spilled, your blood-alcohol
level is quite above .05.   As you  sway backwards  to lie on the
floor, I trace patterns in the fluid running down your cheek. You
grasp my hand, stroke my finger with your tongue, and then gently
draw my finger into your mouth.  Before this can go much further,
I withdraw, and playfully nudge your shoulder.
 `Come on, there's a more private place down the road from here.'
your arm snakes around my waist and you drag me closer, down next
to you.  You breathe a heartfelt sigh, and murmur,
 `Kelanie,  if we don't do it in the next ten minutes,  I'm gonna
explode.'

 It's just past one a.m.,  and  we are at the tram-stop,  waiting
for what passes for light rail in Adelaide.
 `Yes,  we could have  taken my father's car,  but  my feet don't
reach the pedals,  and you are pissed.'  I explain. `Anyway, here
comes the tram.'  Yes,  it was old ninety-seven, the only tram in
Adelaide  (and possibly  the only tram in the world)  run by  the
undead.  The driver's skull, covered with thin tatters of rotting
flesh,  peers out  over the large round light on the front of the
tram.   I could just see glinting,  metallic  green lights in his
eye-sockets.   We climb on board,  and  have no trouble finding a
seat,  as  the only other passengers  are strung up by their feet
from the hand-straps, concerned with  decomposing.  The conductor
would ordinarily have been by to collect our fares,  but he seems
to have  rotted away completely...  there is  nothing left of him
but  a pile of mouldering slime  with bare white bones poking out
at odd angles.  You  glance  about  in  mild surprise,  and  say,
 `I had always heard that Adelaide was dead on weekends...'

 The tram passes  some residential areas,  with  crowds of people
happily   engaged   in   burning   suspected  witches  (or  other
malcontents)  at the stake.   At the shopping centre,  there  are
five blackened figures  tied to a large lamp-post,  blazing  away
above  a stack of tyres.   A maypole-chain of little children are
dancing   around   the  fire  at  a  safe  distance,  singing  in
beautifully clear soprano:

 `Amor est magis
  cognituus quam cognito...'

 A line of monks trail past, murmuring:

 `Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam...'

 The tram is now  out of  the residential area and into the light
industrial zone.   We pass  a number of factories;  dark, satanic
mills which belch smoke in a truly Dickensian fashion,  before we
come to a slight hill, where the tram slows down.
 `We'll have to jump off here, Mark, 'cos the tram doesn't stop,'
I caution  you,  `so get ready.'   As  we jump to  the ground,  I
imagine  that  I hear  the conductor mutter  the  mystical  word,
 `Minadoor'.
 We run from  shadow to shadow down the darkened street, giggling
like six-year-olds,  and  you catch up to me,  grab my  hands and
hold them outstretched  (this isn't fair  -  your arms are longer
than mine!),  pinioning me against a cyclone netting fence.  Your
lips  seek out mine,  and  they make contact again.   You hold me
there  for almost  a minute,  only pausing  to catch your breath,
which gives me an opportunity to gasp,
 `We're here, Mark.'  You look around, and smile.
 `You want to do it in the street?  That's more private?'  I jerk
my thumb towards the factory behind me.
 `Barnstable's Mattress Factory.'   I extract  one hand from your
grasp and fish a small pair of wire-cutters from my purse-pouch.

 I lead you around the fence  until we reach the point closest to
the warehouse.   We hide behind a tree  until  the security robot
stamps past  (it's  sort of like ED-209 with teeth),  and  then I
snip a small hole in the fence, near the ground.
 `That won't be detected  until  the maintenance crew inspect it,
which happens once a week.   Like, next Thursday.'  I get down on
my hands and knees, drop to my belly and wiggle through. Standing
on  the other  side,  our fingers  touching  through the mesh,  I
whisper, `Come on.'
 `You've done this before, haven't you?'
 `I lived  in this warehouse  for  two months,  after Raf's squat
burned  down...  come on,  the  guard  will  be  back  in  eighty
seconds!'   You crawl through the narrow gap,  and follow me over
to a  fire-escape at the side of the building.  You  follow me up
the rusty ladder,  and when  I pause  at the top to make sure the
coast is clear,  you climb further  until you can rest your cheek
on my thigh, with an arm wrapped tightly around my legs.
 `Mark... I'll  warn you once:  if you bite my bum out here,  you
will sincerely regret it.  Come on, there's a gap in the skylight
up here in the corner.'

 You trace a  frivolous  skull-and-crossbones pattern in the dust
and grime that coats the glass paneling, and then we wipe it away
and peer through.
 `I can't see  anything  down  there...  are you  sure?'  I smile
sweetly back at you, and work the loose panel open.
 `No.' then I step through the gap and drop in.
 `KELY!' you shout. There is a soft thump, far below.
 `Shhhh!  Come on,  you're right above it,  just step through the
skylight,  and try to  land on  your bum.'   It is a testimony to
your trust in me that  you do so with only a moment's hesitation,
and  you  land  on  the  top  of  a  fifteen-foot  tall  stack of
mattresses, next to me.
 `Whoah!'
 `Yes, isn't it?  We all used to sleep up here - Mark, stop that,
we'll  fall  off - Mark,  I'm  not  kidding;  it's  very - mmmmff
wwffwf-'  and,  once again,  I am  impressed  by  your  skill  in
silencing me by  the  most direct method  available.   While your
kiss  presses me back  into the  mattresses,  your hands  slip up
under my windcheater to cup my breasts.  I can feel your erection
pushing against my thigh,  and so  I return the gesture, bringing
my knee  up between  your legs,  while  my hands  claw  your back
involuntarily.   As you tweak my nipples  (again, there is little
margin between  pleasure and pain),  I  feel  your hands begin to
move hesitantly,  and as you wriggle your hips, I understand your
dilemma, and giggle,
 `You'll have to let go of me to get your pants off!'  and  so we
release each other,  and while still joined in what is proving to
be one of the most erotically stimulating kisses that I have ever
been involved in,  you  fumble with  the  brass stud on my jeans,
taking the time  to  trace  a smiling face  in  the tingling area
around my belly button with your index finger.  I use one foot to
lever off my sneakers,  and in doing so,  apply pressure (with my
knee)  to  your erection,  which  grows  impressively.  You moan,
 `Oh Kel,  stop that,  I'm going to come in my pants!' You hug me
tightly,  and  I throw my head back,  gasping,  as  you sink your
teeth  into my throat.   With my jeans somewhere around my knees,
you  claw  frantically  at  my  panties,  and  then  you  slowly,
teasingly,  insinuate your  middle finger  into my slick wetness,
your palm flat against my pubis.   You take both my hands in your
free hand, holding them above my head, teasing my collarbone with
your tongue,  slowly  forcing my legs as far apart as the tangled
jeans  (which are  now around my ankles)  will allow,  with  your
knees.  I can hardly move as you slip two,  three,  and then four
fingers into me, stroking the outer lips; as you slowly propel me
towards  the focal point  of ecstasy,  my  gasps  become  hoarse,
gutteral cries  which  you smother with another deep kiss.   I am
almost there when you withdraw your hand, and being left hovering
on the edge  is  exquisite  pain,  which  you  can  sense  in  my
trembling body.   You trace  tear-tracks  from  the corners of my
eyes,  down my cheeks,  with a finger,  fragrant  with my fluids.
 Just you wait, Mark, I think.
 Before I can  give vent to  a  scream of frustration,  you bring
your erection  towards me,  gently  inserting  the head,  teasing
again,  and then (finally!) you slide in to me.   We both shudder
in unadulterated pleasure as you bury yourself in me to the hilt,
giving a  playful twitch of your hips  towards  the  end  of  the
stroke.   We lie there,  intermeshed,  as close together as it is
possible to be... I caress your shaft with tiny contractions, and
you stir within me  with  a pulsing movement  that  makes me draw
short  ecstatic breaths  through gritted teeth.  I manage to kick
my jeans off completely, and you begin to withdraw, only slightly
impeded  by  my legs  wrapped tightly  around your waist.   For a
moment,  I am suspended there,  while you kneel with me clutching
desperately to  stay with you...  but  gravity defeats  me  and I
slowly slide down your shaft,  gradually  coming to rest with the
swollen head of your penis clasped in me.   You pause there,  and
with my mouth, I can feel a smile on yours as you wait.
 `Mark...  stop teasing!'   I have to  punch you  on the shoulder
before  you  begin  the  next  stroke,  sliding in  with a smooth
mechanical motion, with that twitch of the hips at the end of the
path that makes me want to cry out.  You withdraw,  and your next
stroke  is  even  slower  than  the  previous.   I can  feel  the
trembling of  an orgasm  building,  like the  intimations  of  an
earthquake  that   only  the  most   esoterically  sensitive  can
perceive.   You begin a slow,  steady rhythm,  lifting me off the
mattress with each withdrawal,  forcing  a gasp from me with each
insertion.   I begin to add to the sensation by squeezing down on
you as you slide out;  I can  tell that it affects you,  as  your
timing becomes  more erratic as  you approach orgasm.    I feel a
rush of warmth  below my belly,  which  shoots  up my middle  and
knocks  my breath from me.   I throw my head back as you shudder,
plunging in as far as you can, my legs squeezing your hips as you
come.   As you lie there with your erection pulsing within me,  I
feel as if  I am balanced on the edge of  a very tall building...
you give a final thrust and  push me over the edge,  and I scream
in pleasure as I follow you into orgasm.
 The sound echoes around the empty warehouse,  gradually dampened
by the mattresses...  and then,  we  hear  the  pneumatic hiss of
pistons outside, as the robot guard approaches.  We both gasp and
fall silent,  not daring even to move.   The corrugated iron door
rolls up with a clatter,  and  bright  white light spills in from
the  end  of  the   warehouse.   Perched  up  on  this  stack  of
mattresses,  I  don't think we can be seen...   the hiss,  clank,
hiss,  clank sound approaches... and then, I feel an after-orgasm
building in me.  I whimper,  and you force your lips over mine in
desperation,  holding me very still.   The machine is standing at
the end of the stack of mattresses... its search-lights play over
the roof,  just  missing the open skylight where we entered.   My
legs  contract sharply around you  as I come again,  only  barely
managing  to subliminate  my squeal  into  a  high-pitched `mmnn'
sound.   For a terrible moment,  I  think  that  the  machine has
sensed the sound of  the mattresses  creaking as I came; then, it
turns and stamps off.  We wait until it has shut the roller-doors
again before we dare to breathe once more.
 We lie there,  utterly exhausted,  breathing  into  each other's
ears,  still  intertwined.   You  give a short chuckle of relief.
 `That was very close, very close indeed, Miss Camden.'
 `Oh, Mark... tomorrow night...'
 `Yes?'
 `There's this American Military Base not far from here - '
 `Kelanie!'

         The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans

  In the third week of November, in the year 1895, a dense yellow
fog settled down upon London. From the Monday to the Thurs-
day I doubt whether it was ever possible from our windows in
Baker Street to see the loom of the opposite houses. The first day
Holmes had spent in cross-indexing his huge book of references.
The second and third had been patiently occupied upon a subject
which he had recently made his hobby -- the music of the Middle
Ages. But when, for the fourth time, after pushing back our
chairs from breakfast we saw the greasy, heavy brown swirl still
drifting past us and condensing in oily drops upon the window-
panes, my comrade's impatient and active nature could endure
this drab existence no longer. He paced restlessly about our
sitting-room in a fever of suppressed energy, biting his nails,
tapping the furniture, and chafing against inaction.
  "Nothing of interest in the paper, Watson?" he said.
  I was aware that by anything of interest, Holmes meant any-
thing of criminal interest. There was the news of a revolution, of
a possible war, and of an impending change of government; but
these did not come within the horizon of my companion. I could
see nothing recorded in the shape of crime which was not
commonplace and futile. Holmes groaned and resumed his rest-
less meanderings.
  "The London criminal is certainly a dull fellow," said he in
the querulous voice of the sportsman whose game has failed him.
"Look out of this window, Watson. See how the figures loom
up, are dimly seen, and then blend once more into the cloud-
bank. The thief or the murderer could roam London on such a
day as the tiger does the jungle, unseen until he pounces, and
then evident only to his victim."
  "There have," said I, "been numerous petty thefts."
  Holmes snorted his contempt.
  "This great and sombre stage is set for something more
worthy than that," said he. "It is fortunate for this community
that I am not a criminal."
  "It is, indeed!" said I heartily.
  "Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, or any of the fifty
men who have good reason for taking my life, how long could I
survive against my own pursuit? A summons, a bogus appointment,
and all would be over. It is well they don't have days of fog in
the Latin countries -- the countries of assassination. By Jove! here
comes something at last to break our dead monotony."
  It was the maid with a telegram. Holmes tore it open and burst
out laughing.
  "Well, well! What next?" said he. "Brother Mycroft is com-
ing round."
  "Why not?" I asked.
  "Why not? It is as if you met a tram-car coming down a
country lane. Mycroft has his rails and he runs on them. His Pall
Mall lodgings, the Diogenes Club, Whitehall -- that is his cycle.
Once, and only once, he has been here. What upheaval can
possibly have derailed him?"
  "Does he not explain?"
  Holmes handed me his brother's telegram.

         Must see you over Cadogan West. Coming at once.
                                                MYCROFT.

  "Cadogan West? I have heard the name."
  "It recalls nothing to my mind. But that Mycroft should break
out in this erratic fashion! A planet might as well leave its orbit.
By the way, do you know what Mycroft is?"
  I had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of
the Adventure of the Greek Interpreter.
  "You told me that he had some small office under the British
government."
  Holmes chuckled.
  "I did not know you quite so well in those days. One has to
be discreet when one talks of high matters of state. You are
right in thinking that he is under the British government. You
would also be right in a sense if you said that occasionally
he is the British government."
  "My dear Holmes!"
  "I thought I might surprise you. Mycroft draws four hundred
and fifty pounds a year, remains a subordinate, has no ambitions
of any kind, will receive neither honour nor title, but remains the
most indispensable man in the country."
  "But how?"
  "Well, his position is unique. He has made it for himself.
There has never been anything like it before, nor will be again.
He has the tidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest
capacity for storing facts, of any man living. The same great
powers which I have turned to the detection of crime he has used
for this particular business. The conclusions of every department
are passed to him, and he is the central exchange, the clearing-
house, which makes out the balance. All other men are special-
ists, but his specialism is omniscience. We will suppose that a
minister needs information as to a point which involves the
Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get
his separate advices from various departments upon each, but
only Mycroft can focus them all, and say offhand how each
factor would affect the other. They began by using him as a
short-cut, a convenience; now he has made himself an essential.
In that great brain of his everything is pigeon-holed and can be
handed out in an instant. Again and again his word has decided
the national policy. He lives in it. He thinks of nothing else save
when, as an intellectual exercise, he unbends if I call upon him
and ask him to advise me on one of my little problems. But
Jupiter is descending to-day. What on earth can it mean? Who is
Cadogan West, and what is he to Mycroft?"
  "I have it," I cried, and plunged among the litter of papers
upon the sofa. "Yes, yes, here he is, sure enough! Cadogan
West was the young man who was found dead on the Under-
ground on Tuesday morning."
  Holmes sat up at attention, his pipe halfway to his lips.
  "This must be serious, Watson. A death which has caused my
brother to alter his habits can be no ordinary one. What in the
world can he have to do with it? The case was featureless as I
remember it. The young man had apparently fallen out of the train
and killed himself. He had not been robbed, and there was no
particular reason to suspect violence. Is that not so?"
  "There has been an inquest," said I, "and a good many fresh
facts have come out. Looked at more closely, I should certainly
say that it was a curious case."
  "Judging by its effect upon my brother, I should think it must
be a most extraordinary one." He snuggled down in his arm-
chair. "Now, Watson, let us have the facts."
  "The man's name was Arthur Cadogan West. He was twenty-
seven years of age, unmarried, and a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal."
  "Government employ. Behold the link with Brother Mycroft!"
  "He left Woolwich suddenly on Monday night. Was last seen
by his fiancee, Miss Violet Westbury, whom he left abruptly in
the fog about 7:30 that evening. There was no quarrel between
them and she can give no motive for his action. The next thing
heard of him was when his dead body was discovered by a
plate-layer named Mason, just outside Aldgate Station on the
Underground system in London."
  "When?"
  "The body was found at six on the Tuesday morning. It was
lying wide of the metals upon the left hand of the track as one
goes eastward, at a point close to the station, where the line
emerges from the tunnel in which it runs. The head was badly
crushed -- an injury which might well have been caused by a fall
from the train. The body could only have come on the line in
that way. Had it been carried down from any neighbouring
street, it must have passed the station barriers, where a collector
is always standing. This point seems absolutely certain."
  "Very good. The case is definite enough. The man, dead or
alive, either fell or was precipitated from a train. So much is
clear to me. Continue."
  "The trains which traverse the lines of rail beside which the
body was found are those which run from west to east, some
being purely Metropolitan, and some from Willesden and outly-
ing junctions. It can be stated for certain that this young man
when he met his death, was travelling in this direction at some
late hour of the night, but at what point he entered the train it is
impossible to state."
  "His ticket, of course, would show that."
  "There was no ticket in his pockets."
  "No ticket! Dear me, Watson, this is really very singular.
According to my experience it is not possible to reach the
platform of a Metropolitan train without exhibiting one's ticket.
Presumably, then, the young man had one. Was it taken from
him in order to conceal the station from which he came? It is
possible. Or did he drop it in the carriage? That also is possible.
But the point is of curious interest. I understand that there was
no sign of robbery?"
  "Apparently not. There is a list here of his possessions. His
purse contained two pounds fifteen. He had also a check-book on
the Woolwich branch of the Capital and Counties Bank. Through
this his identity was established. There were also two dress-circle
tickets for the Woolwich Theatre, dated for that very evening.
Also a small packet of technical papers."
  Holmes gave an exclamation of satisfaction.
  "There we have it at last, Watson! British government --
Woolwich. Arsenal -- technical papers -- Brother Mycroft, the chain
is complete. But here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to speak
for himself."
  A moment later the tall and portly form of Mycroft Holmes
was ushered into the room. Heavily built and massive, there was
a suggestion of uncouth physical inertia in the figure, but above
this unwieldy frame there was perched a head so masterful in its
brow, so alert in its steel-gray, deep-set eyes, so firm in its lips,
and so subtle in its play of expression, that after the first glance
one forgot the gross body and remembered only the dominant
mind.
  At his heels came our old friend Lestrade, of Scotland Yard --
thin and austere. The gravity of both their faces foretold some
weighty quest. The detective shook hands without a word. Mycroft
Holmes struggled out of his overcoat and subsided into an armchair.
  "A most annoying business, Sherlock," said he. "I extremely
dislike altering my habits, but the powers that be would take no
denial. In the present state of Siam it is most awkward that I
should be away from the office. But it is a real crisis. I have
never seen the Prime Minister so upset. As to the Admiralty -- it
is buzzing like an overturned bee-hive. Have you read up the
case?"
  "We have just done so. What were the technical papers?"
  "Ah, there's the point! Fortunately, it has not come out. The
press would be furious if it did. The papers which this wretched
youth had in his pocket were the plans of the Bruce-Partington
submarine."
  Mycroft Holmes spoke with a solemnity which showed his
sense of the importance of the subject. His brother and I sat
expectant.
  "Surely you have heard of it? I thought everyone had heard of
it."
  "Only as a name."
  "Its importance can hardly be exaggerated. It has been the
most jealously guarded of all government secrets. You may take
it from me that naval warfare becomes impossible within the
radius of a Bruce-Partington's operation. Two years ago a very
large sum was smuggled through the Estimates and was ex-
pended in acquiring a monopoly of the invention. Every effort
has been made to keep the secret. The plans, which are exceed-
ingly intricate, comprising some thirty separate patents, each
essential to the working of the whole, are kept in an elaborate
safe in a confidential office adjoining the arsenal, with burglar-
proof doors and windows. Under no conceivable circumstances
were the plans to be taken from the office. If the chief construc-
tor of the Navy desired to consult them, even he was forced to
go to the Woolwich office for the purpose. And yet here we find
them in the pocket of a dead junior clerk in the heart of London.
From an official point of view it's simply awful."
  "But you have recovered them?"
  "No, Sherlock, no! That's the pinch. We have not. Ten
papers were taken from Woolwich. There were seven in the
pocket of Cadogan West. The three most essential are gone -- 
stolen, vanished. You must drop everything, Sherlock. Never
mind your usual petty puzzles of the police-court. It's a vital
international problem that you have to solve. Why did Cadogan
West take the papers, where are the missing ones, how did he
die, how came his body where it was found, how can the evil be
set right? Find an answer to all these questions, and you will
have done good service for your country."
  "Why do you not solve it yourself, Mycroft? You can see as
far as I."
  "Possibly, Sherlock. But it is a question of getting details.
Give me your details, and from an armchair I will return you an
excellent expert opinion. But to run here and run there, to
cross-question railway guards, and lie on my face with a lens to
my eye -- it is not my metier. No, you are the one man who can
clear the matter up. If you have a fancy to see your name in the
next honours list --"
  My friend smiled and shook his head.
  "I play the game for the game's own sake," said he. "But the
problem certainly presents some points of interest, and I shall be
very pleased to look into it. Some more facts, please."
  "I have jotted down the more essential ones upon this sheet of
paper, together with a few addresses which you will find of
service. The actual official guardian of the papers is the famous
government expert, Sir James Walter. whose decorations and
sub-titles fill two lines of a book of reference. He has grown
gray in the service, is a gentleman, a favoured guest in the most
exalted houses, and, above all, a man whose patriotism is beyond
suspicion. He is one of two who have a key of the safe. I may
add that the papers were undoubtedly in the office during work-
ing hours on Monday, and that Sir James left for London about
three o'clock taking his key with him. He was at the house of
Admiral Sinclair at Barclay Square during the whole of the
evening when this incident occurred."
  "Has the fact been verified?"
  "Yes; his brother, Colonel Valentine Walter, has testified to
his departure from Woolwich, and Admiral Sinclair to his
arrival in London; so Sir James is no longer a direct factor in the
problem."
  "Who was the other man with a key?"
  "The senior clerk and draughtsman, Mr. Sidney Johnson. He
is a man of forty, married, with five children. He is a silent,
morose man, but he has, on the whole, an excellent record in the
public service. He is unpopular with his colleagues, but a hard
worker. According to his own account, corroborated only by the
word of his wife, he was at home the whole of Monday evening
after office hours, and his key has never left the watch-chain
upon which it hangs."
  "Tell us about Cadogan West."
  "He has been ten years in the service and has done good
work. He has the reputation of being hot-headed and impetuous,
but a straight, honest man. We have nothing against him. He was
next to Sidney Johnson in the office. His duties brought him into
daily, personal contact with the plans. No one else had the
handling of them."
  "Who locked the plans up that night?"
  "Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk."
  "Well, it is surely perfectly clear who took them away. They
are actually found upon the person of this junior clerk, Cadogan
West. That seems final, does it not?"
  "It does, Sherlock, and yet it leaves so much unexplained. In
the first place, why did he take them?"
  "I presume they were of value?"
  "He could have got several thousands for them very easily."
  "Can you suggest any possible motive for taking the papers to
London except to sell them?"
  "No, I cannot."
  "Then we must take that as our working hypothesis. Young
West took the papers. Now this could only be done by having a
false key --"
  "Several false keys. He had to open the building and the
room."
  "He had, then, several false keys. He took the papers to
London to sell the secret, intending, no doubt, to have the plans
themselves back in the safe next morning before they were
missed. While in London on this treasonable mission he met his
end."
  "How?"
  "We will suppose that he was travelling back to Woolwich
when he was killed and thrown out of the compartment."
  "Aldgate, where the body was found, is considerably past the
station for London Bridge, which would be his route to
Woolwich."
  "Many circumstances could be imagined under which he would
pass London Bridge. There was someone in the carriage, for
example, with whom he was havitlg an absorbing interview. This
interview led to a violent scene in which he lost his life. Possibly
he tried to leave the carriage, fell out on the line, and so met his
end. The other closed the door. There was a thick fog, and
nothing could be seen."
  "No better explanation can be given with our present knowl-
edge; and yet consider, Sherlock, how much you leave un-
touched. We will suppose, for argument's sake, that young
Cadogan West had determined to convey these papers to Lon-
don. He would naturally have made an appointment with the
foreign agent and kept his evening clear. Instead of that he took
two tickets for the theatre, escorted his fiancee halfway there,
and then suddenly disappeared."
  "A blind," said Lestrade, who had sat listening with some
impatience to the conversation.
  "A very singular one. That is objection No. 1. Objection No.
2: We will suppose that he reaches London and sees the foreign
agent. He must bring back the papers before morning or the loss
will be discovered. He took away ten. Only seven were in his
pocket. What had become of the other three? He certainly would
not leave them of his own free will. Then, again, where is the
price of his treason? One would have expected to find a large
sum of money in his pocket."
  "It seems to me perfectly clear," said Lestrade. "I have no
doubt at all as to what occurred. He took the papers to sell them.
He saw the agent. They could not agree as to price. He started
home again, but the agent went with him. In the train the agent
murdered him, took the more essential papers, and threw his
body from the carriage. That would account for everything,
would it not?"
  "Why had he no ticket?"
  "The ticket would have shown which station was nearest the
agent's house. Therefore he took it from the murdered man's
pocket."
  "Good, Lestrade, very good," said Holmes. "Your theory
holds together. But if this is true, then the case is at an end. On
the one hand, the traitor is dead. On the other, the plans of the
Bruce-Partington submarine are presumably already on the Con-
tinent. What is there for us to do?"
  "To act, Sherlock -- to act!" cried Mycroft, springing to his
feet. "All my instincts are against this explanation. Use your
powers! Go to the scene of the crime! See the people concerned!
Leave no stone unturned! In all your career you have never had
so great a chance of serving your country."
  "Well, well!" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. "Come,
Watson! And you, Lestrade, could you favour us with your
company for an hour or two? We will begin our investigation by
a visit to Aldgate Station. Good-bye, Mycroft. I shall let you
have a report before evening, but I warn you in advance that you
have little to expect."
  An hour later Holmes, Lestrade and I stood upon the Under-
ground railroad at the point where it emerges from the tunnel
immediately before Aldgate Station. A courteous red-faced old
gentleman represented the railway company.
  "This is where the young man's body lay," said he, indicat-
ing a spot about three feet from the metals. "It could not have
fallen from above, for these, as you see, are all blank walls.
Therefore, it could only have come from a train, and that train,
so far as we can trace it, must have passed about midnight on
Monday."
  "Have the carriages been examined for any sign of violence?"
  "There are no such signs, and no ticket has been found."
  "No record of a door being found open?"
  "None."
  "We have had some fresh evidence this morning," said
Lestrade. "A passenger who passed Aldgate in an ordinary
Metropolitan train about 11:40 on Monday night declares that he
heard a heavy thud, as of a body striking the line, just before the
train reached the station. There was dense fog, however, and
nothing could be seen. He made no report of it at the time. Why
whatever is the matter with Mr. Holmes?"
  My friend was standing with an expression of strained inten-
sity upon his face, staring at the railway metals where they
curved out of the tunnel. Aldgate is a junction, and there was a
network of points. On these his eager, questioning eyes were
fixed, and I saw on his keen, alert face that tightening of the
lips, that quiver of the nostrils, and concentration of the heavy
tufted brows which I knew so well.
  "Points," he muttered, "the points."
  "What of it? What do you mean?"
  "I suppose there are no great number of points on a system
such as this?"
  "No; there are very few."
  "And a curve, too. Points, and a curve. By Jove! if it were
only so."
  "What is it, Mr. Holmes? Have you a clue?"
  "An idea -- an indication, no more. But the case certainly
grows in interest. Unique, perfectly unique, and yet why not? I
do not see any indications of bleeding on the line."
  "There were hardly any."
  "But I understand that there was a considerable wound."
  "The bone was crushed, but there was no great external
injury."
  "And yet one would have expected some bleeding. Would it
be possible for me to inspect the train which contained the
passenger who heard the thud of a fall in the fog?"
  "I fear not, Mr. Holmes. The train has been broken up before
now, and the carriages redistributed."
  "I can assure you, Mr. Holmes," said Lestrade, "that every
carriage has been carefully examined. I saw to it myself."
  It was one of my friend's most obvious weaknesses that he
was impatient with less alert intelligences than his own.
  "Very likely," said he, turning away. "As it happens, it was
not the carriages which I desired to examine. Watson, we have
done all we can here. We need not trouble you any further, Mr.
Lestrade. I think our investigations must now carry us to
Woolwich."
  At London Bridge, Holmes wrote a telegram to his brother,
which he handed to me before dispatching it. It ran thus:

      See some light in the darkness, but it may possibly flicker
    out. Meanwhile, please send by messenger, to await return
    at Baker Street, a complete list of all foreign spies or
    international agents known to be in England, with full
    address.
                                                       SHERLOCK.
      
  "That should be helpful, Watson," he remarked as we took
our seats in the Woolwich train. "We certainly owe Brother
Mycroft a debt for having introduced us to what promises to be a
really very remarkable case."
  His eager face still wore that expression of intense and high-
strung energy, which showed me that some novel and suggestive
circumstance had opened up a stimulating line of thought. See
the foxhound with hanging ears and drooping tail as it lolls about
the kennels, and compare it with the same hound as, with
gleaming eyes and straining muscles, it runs upon a breast-high
scent -- such was the change in Holmes since the morning. He
was a different man from the limp and lounging figure in the
mouse-coloured dressing-gown who had prowled so restlessly
only a few hours before round the fog-girt room.
  "There is material here. There is scope," said he. "I am dull
indeed not to have understood its possibilities."
  "Even now they are dark to me."
  "The end is dark to me also, but I have hold of one idea
which may lead us far. The man met his death elsewhere, and
his body was on the roof of a carriage."
  "On the roof!"
  "Remarkable, is it not? But consider the facts. Is it a coinci-
dence that it is found at the very point where the train pitches
and sways as it comes round on the points? Is not that the place
where an object upon the roof might be expected to fall off? The
points would affect no object inside the train. Either the body fell
from the roof, or a very curious coincidence has occurred. But
now consider the question of the blood. Of course, there was no
bleeding on the line if the body had bled elsewhere. Each fact is
suggestive in itself. Together they have a cumulative force."
  "And the ticket, too!" I cried.
  "Exactly. We could not explain the absence of a ticket. This
would explain it. Everything fits together."
  "But suppose it were so, we are still as far as ever from
unravelling the mystery of his death. Indeed, it becomes not
simpler but stranger."
  "Perhaps," said Holmes thoughtfully, "perhaps." He re-
lapsed into a silent reverie, which lasted until the slow train drew
up at last in Woolwich Station. There he called a cab and drew
Mycroft's paper from his pocket.
  "We have quite a little round of afternoon calls to make,"
said he. "I think that Sir James Walter claims our first attention. "
  The house of the famous official was a fine villa with green
lawns, stretching down to the Thames. As we reached it the fog
was lifting, and a thin, watery sunshine was breaking through. A
butler answered our ring.
  "Sir James, sir!" said he with solemn face. "Sir James died
this morning."
  "Good heavens!" cried Holmes in amazement. "How did he
die?"
  "Perhaps you would care to step in, sir, and see his brother,
Colonel Valentine?"
  "Yes, we had best do so."
  We were ushered into a dim-lit drawing-room, where an in-
stant later we were joined by a very tall, handsome, light-
bearded man of fifty, the younger brother of the dead scientist.
His wild eyes, stained cheeks, and unkempt hair all spoke of the
sudden blow which had fallen upon the household. He was
hardly articulate as he spoke of it.
  "It was this horrible scandal," said he. "My brother, Sir
James, was a man of very sensitive honour, and he could not
survive such an affair. It broke his heart. He was always so
proud of the efficiency of his department, and this was a crush-
ing blow."
  "We had hoped that he might have given us some indications
which would have helped us to clear the matter up."
  "I assure you that it was all a mystery to him as it is to you
and to all of us. He had already put all his knowledge at the
disposal of the police. Naturally he had no doubt that Cadogan
West was guilty. But all the rest was inconceivable."
  "You cannot throw any new light upon the affair?"
  "I know nothing myself save what I have read or heard. I
have no desire to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr.
Holmes, that we are much disturbed at present, and I must ask
you to hasten this interview to an end."
  "This is indeed an unexpected development," said my friend
when we had regained the cab. "I wonder if the death was
natural, or whether the poor old fellow killed himself! If the
latter, may it be taken as some sign of self-reproach for duty
neglected? We must leave that question to the future. Now we
shall turn to the Cadogan Wests."
  A small but well-kept house in the outskirts of the town
sheltered the bereaved mother. The old lady was too dazed with
grief to be of any use to us, but at her side was a white-faced
young lady, who introduced herself as Miss Violet Westbury, the
fiancee of the dead man, and the last to see him upon that fatal
night.
  "I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes," she said. "I have not shut
an eye since the tragedy, thinking, thinking, thinking, night and
day, what the true meaning of it can be. Arthur was the most
single-minded, chivalrous, patriotic man upon earth. He would
have cut his right hand off before he would sell a State secret
confided to his keeping. It is absurd, impossible, preposterous to
anyone who knew him."
  "But the facts, Miss Westbury?"
  "Yes, yes I admit I cannot explain them."
  "Was he in any want of money?"
  "No; his needs were very simple and his salary ample. He had
saved a few hundreds, and we were to marry at the New Year."
  "No signs of any mental excitement? Come, Miss Westbury,
be absolutely frank with us."
  The quick eye of my companion had noted some change in her
manner. She coloured and hesitated.
  "Yes," she said at last, "I had a feeling that there was
something on his mind."
  "For long?"
  "Only for the last week or so. He was thoughtful and worried.
Once I pressed him about it. He admitted that there was some-
thing, and that it was concerned with his official life. 'It is too
serious for me to speak about, even to you,' said he. I could get
nothing more."
  Holmes looked grave.
  "Go on, Miss Westbury. Even if it seems to tell against him,
go on. We cannot say what it may lead to."
  "Indeed, I have nothing more to tell. Once or twice it seemed
to me that he was on the point of telling me something. He spoke
one evening of the importance of the secret, and I have some
recollection that he said that no doubt foreign spies would pay a
great deal to have it."
  My friend's face grew graver still.
  "Anything else?"
  "He said that we were slack about such matters -- that it would
be easy for a traitor to get the plans."
  "Was it only recently that he made such remarks?"
  "Yes, quite recently."
  "Now tell us of that last evening."
  "We were to go to the theatre. The fog was so thick that a cab
was useless. We walked, and our way took us close to the office.
Suddenly he darted away into the fog."
  "Without a word?"
  "He gave an exclamation; that was all. I waited but he never
returned. Then I walked home. Next morning, after the office
opened, they came to inquire. About twelve o'clock we heard
the terrible news. Oh, Mr. Holmes, if you could only, only save
his honour! It was so much to him."
  Holmes shook his head sadly.
  "Come, Watson," said he, "our ways lie elsewhere. Our next
station must be the office from which the papers were taken.
  "It was black enough before against this young man, but our
inquiries make it blacker," he remarked as the cab lumbered off.
"His coming marriage gives a motive for the crime. He naturally
wanted money. The idea was in his head, since he spoke about
it. He nearly made the girl an accomplice in the treason by
telling her his plans. It is all very bad."
  "But surely, Holmes, character goes for something? Then,
again, why should he leave the girl in the street and dart away to
commit a felony?"
  "Exactly! There are certainly objections. But it is a formida-
ble case which they have to meet."
  Mr. Sidney Johnson, the senior clerk, met us at the office and
recelved us with that respect which my companion's card always
commanded. He was a thin, gruff, bespectacled man of middle
age, his cheeks haggard, and his hands twitching from the
nervous strain to which he had been subjected.
  "It is bad, Mr. Holmes, very bad! Have you heard of the
death of the chief?"
  "We have just come from his house."
  "The place is disorganized. The chief dead, Cadogan West
dead, our papers stolen. And yet, when we closed our door on
Monday evening, we were as efficient an office as any in the
government service. Good God, it's dreadful to think of! That
West, of all men, should have done such a thing!"
  "You are sure of his guilt, then?"
  "I can see no other way out of it. And yet I would have trusted
him as I trust myself."
  "At what hour was the office closed on Monday?"
  "At five."
  "Did you close it?"
  "I am always the last man out."
  "Where were the plans?"
  "In that safe. I put them there myself."
  "Is there no watchman to the building?"
  "There is, but he has other departments to look after as well.
He is an old soldier and a most trustworthy man. He saw nothing
that evening. Of course the fog was very thick."
  "Suppose that Cadogan West wished to make his way into the
building after hours; he would need three keys, would he not,
before he could reach the papers?"
  "Yes, he would. The key of the outer door, the key of the
office, and the key of the safe."
  "Only Sir James Walter and you had those keys?"
  "I had no keys of the doors -- only of the safe."
  "Was Sir James a man who was orderly in his habits?"
  "Yes, I think he was. I know that so far as those three keys
are concerned he kept them on the same ring. I have often seen
them there."
  "And that ring went with him to London?"
  "He said so."
  "And your key never left your possession?"
  "Never."
  "Then West, if he is the culprit, must have had a duplicate.
And yet none was found upon his body. One other point: if a
clerk in this office desired to sell the plans, would it not be
simpler to copy the plans for himself than to take the originals,
as was actually done?"
  "It would take considerable technical knowledge to copy the
plans in an effective way."
  "But I suppose either Sir James, or you, or West had that
technical knowledge?"
  "No doubt we had, but I beg you won't try to drag me into
the matter, Mr. Holmes. What is the use of our speculating in
this way when the original plans were actually found on West?"
  "Well, it is certainly singular that he should run the risk of
taking originals if he could safely have taken copies, which
would have equally served his turn."
  "Singular, no doubt -- and yet he did so."
  "Every inquiry in this case reveals something inexplicable.
Now there are three papers still missing. They are, as I under-
stand, the vital ones."
  "Yes, that is so."
  "Do you mean to say that anyone holding these three papers
and without the seven others, could construct a Bruce-Partington
submarine?"
  "I reported to that effect to the Admiralty. But to-day I have
been over the drawings again, and I am not so sure of it. The
double valves with the automatic self-adjusting slots are drawn in
one of the papers which have been returned. Until the foreigners
had invented that for themselves they could not make the boat.
Of course they might soon get over the difficulty."
  "But the three missing drawings are the most important?"
  "Undoubtedly."
  "I think, with your permission, I will now take a stroll round
me premises. I do not recall any other question which I desired
to ask."
  He examined the lock of the safe, the door of the room, and
finally the iron shutters of the window. It was only when we
were on the lawn outside that his interest was strongly excited.
There was a laurel bush outside the window, and several of the
branches bore signs of having been twisted or snapped. He
examined them carefully with his lens, and then some dim and
vague marks upon the earth beneath. Finally he asked the chief
clerk to close the iron shutters, and he pointed out to me that
they hardly met in the centre, and that it would be possible for
anyone outside to see what was going on within the room.
  "The indications are ruined by the three days' delay. They
may mean something or nothing. Well, Watson, I do not think
that Woolwich can help us further. It is a small crop which we
have gathered. Let us see if we can do better in London."
  Yet we added one more sheaf to our harvest before we left
Woolwich Station. The clerk in the ticket office was able to say
with confidence that he saw Cadogan West -- whom he knew
well by sight -- upon the Monday night, and that he went to
London by the 8:15 to London Bridge. He was alone and took a
single third-class ticket. The clerk was struck at the time by his
excited and nervous manner. So shaky was he that he could
hardly pick up his change, and the clerk had helped him with it.
A reference to the timetable showed that the 8:15 was the first
train which it was possible for West to take after he had left the
lady about 7:30.
  "Let us reconstruct, Watson," said Holmes after half an hour
of silence. "I am not aware that in all our joint researches we
have ever had a case which was more difficult to get at. Every
fresh advance which we make only reveals a fresh ridge beyond.
And yet we have surely made some appreciable progress.
  "The effect of our inquiries at Woolwich has in the main been
against young Cadogan West; but the indications at the window
would lend themselves to a more favourable hypothesis. Let us
suppose, for example, that he had been approached by some
foreign agent. It might have been done under such pledges as
would have prevented him from speaking of it, and yet would
have affected his thoughts in the direction indicated by his
remarks to his fiancee. Very good. We will now suppose that as
he went to the theatre with the young lady he suddenly, in the
fog, caught a glimpse of this same agent going in the direction of
the office. He was an impetuous man, quick in his decisions.
Everything gave way to his duty. He followed the man, reached
the window, saw the abstraction of the documents, and pursued
the thief. In this way we get over the objection that no one would
take originals when he could make copies. This outsider had to
take originals. So far it holds together."
  "What is the next step?"
  "Then we come into difficulties. One would imagine that
under such circumstances the first act of young Cadogan West
would be to seize the villain and raise the alarm. Why did he not
do so? Could it have been an official superior who took the
papers? That would explain West's conduct. Or could the chief
have given West the slip in the fog, and West started at once to
London to head him off from his own rooms, presuming that he
knew where the rooms were? The call must have been very
pressing, since he left his girl standing in the fog and made no
effort to communicate with her. Our scent runs cold here, and
there is a vast gap between either hypothesis and the laying of
West's body, with seven papers in his pocket, on the roof of a
Metropolitan train. My instinct now is to work from the other
end. If Mycroft has given us the list of addresses we may be able
to pick our man and follow two tracks instead of one."
  Surely enough, a note awaited us at Baker Street. A govern-
ment messenger had brought it post-haste. Holmes glanced at it
and threw it over to me.

       There are numerous small fry, but few who would handle
     so big an affair. The only men worth considering are Adolph
     Meyer, of 13 Great George Street, Westminster; Louis La
     Rothiere, of Campden Mansions, Notting Hill; and Hugo
     Oberstein, 13 Caulfield Gardens, Kensington. The latter
     was known to be in town on Monday and is now reported as
     having left. Glad to hear you have seen some light. The
     Cabinet awaits your final report with the utmost anxiety.
     Urgent representations have arrived from the very highest
     quarter. The whole force of the State is at your back if you
     should need it.
                                                       MYCROFT.

  "I'm afraid," said Holmes, smiling, "that all the queen's
horses and all the queen's men cannot avail in this matter." He
had spread out his big map of London and leaned eagerly over it.
"Well, well," said he presently with an exclamation of satisfac-
tion, "things are turning a little in our direction at last. Why
Watson, I do honestly believe that we are going to pull it off,
after all." He slapped me on the shoulder with a sudden burst of
hilarity. "I am going out now. It is only a reconnaissance. I will
do nothing serious without my trusted comrade and biographer at
my elbow. Do you stay here, and the odds are that you will see
me again in an hour or two. If time hangs heavy get foolscap and
a pen, abd begin your narrative of how we saved the State."
  I felt some reflection of his elation in my own mind, for I
knew well that he would not depart so far from his usual
austerity of demeanour unless there was good cause for exulta-
tion. All the long November evening I waited, filled with impa-
tience for his return. At last, shortly after nine o'clock, there
arrived a messenger with a note:

        Am dining at Goldini's Restaurant, Gloucester Road,
      Kensington. Please come at once and join me there. Bring
      with you a jemmy, a dark lantern, a chisel, and a revolver.
                                                            S. H.

  It was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry
through the dim, fog-draped streets. I stowed them all discreetly
away in my overcoat and drove straight to the address given.
There sat my friend at a little round table near the door of the
garish Italian restaurant.
  "Have you had something to eat? Then join me in a coffee
and curacao. Try one of the proprietor's cigars. They are less
poisonous than one would expect. Have you the tools?"
  "They are here, in my overcoat."
  "Excellent. Let me give you a short sketch of what I have
done, with some indication of what we are about to do. Now it
must be evident to you, Watson, that this young man's body was
placed on the roof of the train. That was clear from the instant
that I determined the fact that it was from the roof, and not from
a carriage, that he had fallen."
  "Could it not have been dropped from a bridge?"
  "I should say it was impossible. If you examine the roofs you
will find that they are slightly rounded, and there is no railing
round them. Therefore, we can say for certain that young Cadogan
West was placed on it."
  "How could he be placed there?"
  "That was the question which we had to answer. There is only
one possible way. You are aware that the Underground runs
clear of tunnels at some points in the West End. I had a vague
memory that as I have travelled by it I have occasionally seen
windows just above my head. Now, suppose that a train halted
under such a window, would there be any difficulty in laying a
body upon the roof?"
  "It seems most improbable."
  "We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other
contingencies fail, whatever remains, however improbable, must
be the truth. Here all other contingencies have failed. When I
found that the leading international agent, who had just left
London, lived in a row of houses which abutted upon the Under-
ground, I was so pleased that you were a little astonished at my
sudden frivolity."
  "Oh, that was it, was it?"
  "Yes, that was it. Mr. Hugo Oberstein, of 13 Caulfield
Gardens, had become my objective. I began my operations at
Gloucester Road Station, where a very helpful official walked
with me along the track and allowed me to satisfy myself not
only that the back-stair windows of Caulfield Gardens open on
the line but the even more essential fact that, owing to the
intersection of one of the larger railways, the Underground trains
are frequently held motionless for some minutes at that very
spot."
  "Splendid, Holmes! You have got it!"
  "So far -- so far, Watson. We advance, but the goal is afar.
Well, having seen the back of Caulfield Gardens, I visited the
front and satisfied myself that the bird was indeed flown. It is a
considerable house, unfurnished, so far as I could judge, in the
upper rooms. Oberstein lived there with a single valet, who was
probably a confederate entirely in his confidence. We must bear
in mind that Oberstein has gone to the Continent to dispose of
his booty, but not with any idea of flight; for he had no reason to
fear a warrant, and the idea of an amateur domiciliary visit
would certainly never occur to him. Yet that is precisely what we
are about to make."
  "Could we not get a warrant and legalize it?"
  "Hardly on the evidence."
  "What can we hope to do?"
  "We cannot tell what correspondence may be there."
  "I don't like it, Holmes."
  "My dear fellow, you shall keep watch in the street. I'll do
the criminal part. It's not a time to stick at trifles. Think of
Mycroft's note, of the Admiralty, the Cabinet, the exalted person
who waits for news. We are bound to go."
  My answer was to rise from the table.
  "You are right, Holmes. We are bound to go."
  He sprang up and shook me by the hand.
  "I knew you would not shrink at the last," said he, and for a
moment I saw something in his eyes which was nearer to tender-
ness than I had ever seen. The next instant he was his masterful,
practical self once more.
  "It is nearly half a mile, but there is no hurry. Let us walk,"
said he. "Don't drop the instruments, I beg. Your arrest as a
suspicious character would be a most unfortunate complication."
  Caulfield Gardens was one of those lines of flat-faced, pillared,
and porticoed houses which are so prominent a product of the
middle Victorian epoch in the West End of London. Next door
there appeared to be a children's party, for the merry buzz of
young voices and the clatter of a piano resounded through the
night. The fog still hung about and screened us with its friendly
shade. Holmes had lit his lantern and flashed it upon the massive
door.
  "This is a serious proposition," said he. "It is certainly
bolted as well as locked. We would do better in the area. There
is an excellent archway down yonder in case a too zealous
policeman should intrude. Give me a hand, Watson, and I'll do
the same for you."
  A minute later we were both in the area. Hardly had we
reached the dark shadows before the step of the policeman was
heard in the fog above. As its soft rhythm died away, Holmes set
to work upon the lower door. I saw him stoop and strain until
with a sharp crash it flew open. We sprang through into the dark
passage, closing the area door behind us. Holmes led the way up
the curving, uncarpeted stair. His little fan of yellow light shone
upon a low window.
  "Here we are, Watson -- this must be the one." He threw it
open, and as he did so there was a low, harsh murmur, growing
steadily into a loud roar as a train dashed past us in the darkness.
Holmes swept his light along the window-sill. It was thickly
coated with soot from the passing engines, but the black surface
was blurred and rubbed in places.
  "You can see where they rested the body. Halloa, Watson!
what is this? There can be no doubt that it is a blood mark." He
was pointing to faint discolourations along the woodwork of the
window. "Here it is on the stone of the stair also. The demon-
stration is complete. Let us stay here until a train stops. "
  We had not long to wait. The very next train roared from the
tunnel as before, but slowed in the open, and then, with a
creaking of brakes, pulled up immediately beneath us. It was not
four feet from the window-ledge to the roof of the carriages.
Holmes softly closed the window.
  "So far we are justified," said he. "What do you think of it,
Watson?"
  "A masterpiece. You have never risen to a greater height."
  "I cannot agree with you there. From the moment that I
conceived the idea of the body being upon the roof, which surely
was not a very abstruse one, all the rest was inevitable. If it were
not for the grave interests involved the affair up to this point
would be insignificant. Our difficulties are still before us. But
perhaps we may find something here which may help us."
  We had ascended the kitchen stair and entered the suite of
rooms upon the first floor. One was a dining-room, severely
furnished and containing nothing of interest. A second was a
bedroom, which also drew blank. The remaining room appeared
more promising, and my companion settled down to a systematic
examination. It was littered with books and papers, and was
evidently used as a study. Swiftly and methodically Holmes turned
over the contents of drawer after drawer and cupboard after
cupboard, but no gleam of success came to brighten his austere
face. At the end of an hour he was no further than when he
started.
  "The cunning dog has covered his tracks," said he. "He has
left nothing to incriminate him. His dangerous correspondence
has been destroyed or removed. This is our last chance."
  It was a small tin cash-box which stood upon the writing-
desk. Holmes pried it open with his chisel. Several rolls of paper
were within, covered with figures and calculations, without any
note to show to what they referred. The recurring words "water
pressure" and "pressure to the square inch" suggested some
possible relation to a submarine. Holmes tossed them all impa-
tiently aside. There only remained an envelope with some
small newspaper slips inside it. He shook them out on the
table, and at once I saw by his eager face that his hopes had
been raised.
  "What's this, Watson? Eh? What's this? Record of a series of
messages in the advertisements of a paper. Daily Telegraph
agony column by the print and paper. Right-hand top corner of a
page. No dates -- but messages arrange themselves. This must be
the first:

        "Hoped to hear sooner. Terms agreed to. Write fully to
      address given on card.
                                                      PIERROT.

"Next comes:

        "Too complex for description. Must have full report.
      Stuff awaits you when goods delivered.
                                                    PIERROT.

"Then comes:

        "Matter presses. Must withdraw offer unless contract
      completed. Make appointment by letter. Will confirm by
      advertisement.
                                                    PIERROT.

"Finally:

        "Monday night after nine. Two taps. Only ourselves. Do
      not be so suspicious. Payment in hard cash when goods
      delivered.
                                                      PIERROT.

  "A fairly complete record, Watson! If we could only get at
the man at the other end!" He sat lost in thought, tapping his
fingers on the table. Finally he sprang to his feet.
  "Well, perhaps it won't be so difficult, after all. There is
nothing more to be done here, Watson. I think we might drive
round to the offices of the Daily Telegraph, and so bring a good
day's work to a conclusion."

  Mycroft Holmes and Lestrade had come round by appointment
after breakfast next day and Sherlock Holmes had recounted to
them our proceedings of the day before. The professional shook
his head over our confessed burglary.
  "We can't do these things in the force, Mr. Holmes," said
he. "No wonder you get results that are beyond us. But some of
these days you'll go too far, and you'll find yourself and your
friend in trouble."
  "For England, home and beauty -- eh, Watson? Martyrs on the
altar of our country. But what do you think of it, Mycroft?"
  "Excellent, Sherlock! Admirable! But what use will you make
of it?"
  Holmes picked up the Daily Telegroph which lay upon the
table.
  "Have you seen Pierrot's advertisement to-day?"
  "What? Another one?"
  "Yes, here it is:

        "To-night. Same hour. Same place. Two taps. Most
      vitally important. Your own safety at stake.
                                                PIERROT.

  "By George!" cried Lestrade. "If he answers that we've got
him!"
  "That was my idea when I put it in. I think if you could both
make it convenient to come with us about eight o'clock to
Caulfield Gardens we might possibly get a little nearer to a
solution."

  One of the most remarkable characteristics of Sherlock Holmes
was his power of throwing his brain out of action and switching
all his thoughts on to lighter things whenever he had convinced
himself that he could no longer work to advantage. I remember
that during the whole of that memorable day he lost himself in a
monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic Mo-
tets of Lassus. For my own part I had none of this power of
detachment, and the day, in consequence, appeared to be inter-
minable. The great national importance of the issue, the suspense
in high quarters, the direct nature of the experiment which we
were trying -- all combined to work upon my nerve. It was a
relief to me when at last, after a light dinner, we set out upon our
expedition. Lestrade and Mycroft met us by appointment at the
outside of Gloucester Road Station. The area door of Oberstein's
house had been left open the night before, and it was necessary
for me, as Mycroft Holmes absolutely and indignantly declined
to climb the railings, to pass in and open the hall door. By nine
o'clock we were all seated in the study, waiting patiently for our
man.
  An hour passed and yet another. When eleven struck, the
measured beat of the great church clock seemed to sound the
dirge of our hopes. Lestrade and Mycroft were fidgeting in their
seats and looking twice a minute at their watches. Holmes sat
silent and composed, his eyelids half shut, but every sense on the
alert. He raised his head with a sudden jerk.
  "He is coming," said he.
  There had been a furtive step past the door. Now it returned.
We heard a shuffling sound outside, and then two sharp taps
with the knocker. Holmes rose, motioning to us to remain seated.
The gas in the hall was a mere point of light. He opened the
outer door, and then as a dark figure slipped past him he closed
and fastened it. "This way!" we heard him say, and a moment
later our man stood before us. Holmes had followed him closely,
and as the man turned with a cry of surprise and alarm he caught
him by the collar and threw him back into the room. Before our
prisoner had recovered his balance the door was shut and Holmes
standing with his back against it. The man glared round him,
staggered, and fell senseless upon the floor. With the shock, his
broad-brimmed hat flew from his head, his cravat slipped down
from his lips, and there were the long light beard and the soft,
handsome delicate features of Colonel Valentine Walter.
  Holmes gave a whistle of surprise.
  "You can write me down an ass this time, Watson," said he.
"This was not the bird that I was looking for."
  "Who is he?" asked Mycroft eagerly.
  "The younger brother of the late Sir James Walter, the head
of the Submarine Department. Yes, yes; I see the fall of the
cards. He is coming to. I think that you had best leave his
examination to me."
  We had carried the prostrate body to the sofa. Now our
prisoner sat up, looked round him with a horror-stricken face,
and passed his hand over his forehead, like one who cannot
believe his own senses.
  "What is this?" he asked. "I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein."
  "Everything is known, Colonel Walter," said Holmes. "How
an English gentleman could behave in such a manner is beyond
my comprehension. But your whole correspondence and rela-
tions with Oberstein are within our knowledge. So also are the
circumstances connected with the death of young Cadogan West.
Let me advise you to gain at least the small credit for repentance
and confession, since there are still some details which we can
only learn from your lips."
  The man groaned and sank his face in his hands. We waited,
but he was silent.
  "I can assure you," said Holmes, "that every essential is
already known. We know that you were pressed for money; that
you took an impress of the keys which your brother held; and
that you entered into a correspondence with Oberstein, who
answered your letters through the advertisement columns of the
Daily Telegraph. We are aware that you went down to the office
in the fog on Monday night, but that you were seen and followed
by young Cadogan West, who had probably some previous
reason to suspect you. He saw your theft, but could not give the
alarm, as it was just possible that you were taking the papers to
your brother in London. Leaving all his private concerns, like
the good citizen that he was, he followed you closely in the fog
and kept at your heels until you reached this very house. There
he intervened, and then it was, Colonel Walter, that to treason
you added the more terrible crime of murder."
  "I did not! I did not! Before God I swear that I did not!" cried
our wretched prisoner.
  "Tell us, then, how Cadogan West met his end before you
laid him upon the roof of a railway carriage."
  "I will. I swear to you that I will. I did the rest. I confess it. It
was just as you say. A Stock Exchange debt had to be paid. I
needed the money badly. Oberstein offered me five thousand. It
was to save myself from ruin. But as to murder, I am as innocent
as you."
  "What happened, then?"
  "He had his suspicions before, and he followed me as you
describe. I never knew it until I was at the very door. It was
thick fog, and one could not see three yards. I had given two
taps and Oberstein had come to the door. The young man rushed
up and demanded to know what we were about to do with the
papers. Oberstein had a short life-preserver. He always carried it
with him. As West forced his way after us into the house
Oberstein struck him on the head. The blow was a fatal one. He
was dead within five minutes. There he lay in the hall, and we
were at our wit's end what to do. Then Oberstein had this idea
about the trains which halted under his back window. But first he
examined the papers which I had brought. He said that three of
them were essential, and that he must keep them. 'You cannot
keep them,' said I. 'There will be a dreadful row at Woolwich if
they are not returned.' 'I must keep them,' said he, 'for they are
so technical that it is impossible in the time to make copies.'
'Then they must all go back together tonight,' said I. He thought
for a little, and then he cried out that he had it. 'Three I will
keep,' said he. 'The others we will stuff into the pocket of this
young man. When he is found the whole business will assuredly
be put to his account. I could see no other way out of it, so we
did as he suggested. We waited half an hour at the window
before a train stopped. It was so thick that nothing could be seen,
and we had no difficulty in lowering West's body on to the train.
That was the end of the matter so far as I was concerned."
  "And your brother?"
  "He said nothing, but he had caught me once with his keys,
and I think that he suspected. I read in his eyes that he sus-
pected. As you know, he never held up his head again."
  There was silence in the room. It was broken by Mycroft
Holmes.
  "Can you not make reparation? It would ease your con-
science, and possibly your punishment."
  "What reparation can I make?"
  "Where is Oberstein with the papers?"
  "I do not know."
  "Did he give you no address?"
  "He said that letters to the Hotel du Louvre, Paris, would
eventually reach him."
  "Then reparation is still within your power," said Sherlock
Holmes.
  "I will do anything I can. I owe this fellow no particular
good-will. He has been my ruin and my downfall."
  "Here are paper and pen. Sit at this desk and write to my
dictation. Direct the envelope to the address given. That is right.
Now the letter:

    "DEAR SIR:
      "With regard to our transaction, you will no doubt have
    observed by now that one essential detail is missing. I have
    a tracing which will make it complete. This has involved
    me in extra trouble, however, and I must ask you for a
    further advance of five hundred pounds. I will not trust it to
    the post, nor will I take anything but gold or notes. I would
    come to you abroad, but it would excite remark if I left the
    country at present. Therefore I shall expect to meet you in
    the smoking-room of the Charing Cross Hotel at noon on
    Saturday. Remember that only English notes, or gold, will
    be taken.

That will do very well. I shall be very much surprised if it does
not fetch our man."
  And it did! It is a matter of history -- that secret history of a
nation which is often so much more intimate and interesting than
its public chronicles -- that Oberstein, eager to complete the coup
of his lifetime, came to the lure and was safely engulfed for
fifteen years in a British prison. In his trunk were found the
invaluable Bruce-Partington plans, which he had put up for
auction in all the naval centres of Europe.
  Colonel Walter died in prison towards the end of the second
year of his sentence. As to Holmes, he returned refreshed to his
monograph upon the Polyphonic Motets of Lassus, which has
since been printed for private circulation, and is said by experts
to be the last word upon the subject. Some weeks afterwards I
learned incidentally that my friend spent a day at Windsor,
whence he returned with a remarkably fine emerald tie-pin.
When I asked him if he had bought it, he answered that it was a
present from a certain gracious lady in whose interests he had
once been fortunate enough to carry out a small commission. He
said no more, but I fancy that I could guess at that lady's august
name, and I have little doubt that the emerald pin will forever
recall to my friend's memory the adventure of the Bruce-Partington
plans.

                         THE LION AND THE MOSQUITO

   Once upon a time . . . a tiny mosquito started to buzz round a lion he met.
"Go away!" grumbled the sleepy lion, smacking his own cheek in an attempt to 
drive the insect away.
   "Why should I?" demanded the mosquito. "You're king of the jungle, not of 
the air! I'll fly wherever I want and land wherever I please." And so saying, 
he tickled the lion's ear. In the hope of crushing the insect, the lion boxed 
his own ears, but the mosquito slipped away from the now dazed lion.
   "I don't feel it any more. Either it's squashed or it's gone away." But at 
that very moment, the irritating buzz began again, and the mosquito flew into 
the lion's nose. Wild with rage, the lion leapt to his hind legs and started 
to rain punches on his own nose. But the insect, safe inside, refused to 
budge. With a swollen nose and watery eyes, the lion gave a terrific sneeze, 
blasting the mosquito out. Angry at being dislodged so abruptly, the mosquito 
returned to the attack: BUZZ . . . BUZZZ! . . . it whizzed round the lion's 
head. Large and tough as the lion was, he could not rid himself of his tiny 
tormenter. This made him angrier still, and he roared fiercely. At the sound 
of his terrible voice, all the forest creatures fled in fear, but paying no 
heed to the exhausted lion, the mosquito said triumphantly: "There you are, 
king of the jungle! Foiled by a tiny mosquito like me!" And highly delighted 
with his victory, off he buzzed. But he did not notice a spider's web hanging 
close by, and soon he was turning and twisting, trying to escape from the trap
set by a large spider. "Bah!" said the spider in disgust, as he ate it. 
"Another tiny mosquito. Not much to get excited about, but better than 
nothing. I was hoping for something more substantial..."
   And that's what became of the mosquito that foiled the lion!

I GIVE UP
  by Thomas Nevin Huber

  "It was a dark and stormy night . . ."

  "Not in Alaska," Jerry said, staring at his typewriter. He had hoped 
for a good horror story but this wasn't working.

  He hated writer's block. It was the middle of June in Anchorage, where 
the sun set just before midnight and it never got dark enough to call 
night. How could one get in the mood to write a horror story under these
conditions?

  He looked at the time - 8:00 pm. Stretching, he reached for his old 
jacket. Maybe a walk in the woods would work. Better yet, a walk in the 
cemetery. Maybe something there would break the writer's block. That is, 
if some moose didn't interrupt his thoughts or demolish his garden.

  As he walked outside he saw a moose standing in the woods, watching 
him. He threw a small clod of dirt at it, but the moose didn't flinch. 
He just stared back, looking for all the world like it was smiling. 
"Go away!" Jerry yelled. The moose looked like it didn't care what Jerry 
thought, yelled, or threw.

  Jerry got in his car and drove toward 9th and Denali, where one of 
the older cemeteries was located. Minutes later, he parked at the locked 
gate. Jerry got out and found a sizable break in the fence, left over 
from the earthquake.

  Just as he started through, he thought he heard a noise. Looking 
around, he didn't see anyone, not even at the school across the 
street. Nearby brush crackled loudly. "What the - hello?" he called. 
Shrugging, he squeezed through the break -- tripped and fell.

                              *  *  *

  A loud snuff greeted him. It was a moose, but in the cemetery? He 
shook his head, and then realized there must be other breaks in the 
fence. The moose was munching on one of the bushes. It looked familiar 
and looked like it was smiling.

  Ignoring the moose, Jerry headed toward the older part of the 
cemetery. Maybe the tombstones would inspire something. He was looking 
at names when a black tomcat wandered slowly out and sat in his path. 
"Y'erow," it crackled. It was old and fat.

  "Humph!" Black cats are supposed to be skinny and fast, darting from 
one grave to another. Not old, fat and lazy. Jerry mumbled, "Some excuse 
for a black cat you are."

  The cat looked at him. "Erow?"

  Jerry moved on. Nothing was inspiring about a fat black cat or a dumb
moose.

  He spotted an open grave. He walked up to it and looked in. It was 
deep and foreboding. At least something was foreboding. He glanced at 
the old weathered marker. There seemed to be something missing.

  "I've seen stranger things."

  Jerry jumped at the voice. He looked around, but all he saw was the 
moose, the same one that he saw at the cemetery's wall.

  "I'm hearing things." Maybe he had been talking to himself.

  Then why had he jumped?

  The moose sneezed and Jerry said, "Bless you."

  The moose snorted back.

  Jerry walked around the grave. The sides were neat, like someone had 
used a back hoe to dig it. The pile of dirt - that's what was missing! It
was just a deep hole in the ground. "Curious," Jerry said to himself.

  "Yup."

  Jerry knew he hadn't said that. He felt a sudden urge to relieve 
himself. He looked around for public restrooms.

  "Try the outhouse."

  Jerry stood very still as a chill worked its way up his back and his 
urge became stronger. He turned around and stared at an old, wooden 
outhouse. It was about five feet square, with quarter moons carved out 
of the back and the door for ventilation. How did it get here? They 
didn't use outhouses in Alaska! Not with winter temperatures well below 
zero!

  He slowly opened the creaking door. A Sears and Roebuck catalog lay 
there. He looked at the date on the bottom of the pages - this year's, 
1968.

  He pulled the door shut behind him. He tore a catalog page into 
strips to line the sides of the hole. As he sat, he started through the 
book.

  After a moment, he noticed the unpleasant odor, like rotting meat. 
His stomach tried to climb up his throat and he gagged. Finishing 
quickly, he opened the door and stepped out into a semi-twilight 
world. The sky had taken on a ghostly grey pallor, getting darker by 
the moment. The sun hadn't set, but disappeared from the sky.

  The chill along his spine spread as he looked toward his car. The 
cemetery went on forever, not just a block or two. Darkness was closing 
in fast. Real darkness, not the deep blues and oranges of a typical 
Alaska summer night.

  Without warning, he stumbled on something, something that didn't feel 
like a log or anything solid. Jerry lit a match and stared down. A human 
leg, clothed in blue and white cloth, like an old conductor's overalls, 
but tapered toward the foot. He bent down and looked closely. A shoed 
foot at one end and at the other - raw flesh. He felt his own flesh crawl 
as he watched a tiny white worm wiggle in folds of raw flesh. "Maggots!" 
The idea shocked and repulsed him. He dropped the match.

  As he moved away from the leg, he stepped on something that squalled. 
It was the old black cat. "Oh, sorry," Jerry mumbled. In the dusky light, 
he could make out the cat a few yards away, sitting and licking itself. 
"Dumb cat," Jerry said at the animal. "You'd probably get trampled by 
that moose over there."

  He asked the moose, "Ever step on the cat?"

  "Nope."

  Jerry shook his head. A moose didn't talk. "This place is getting to 
me," he said. "I'd swear you just told me `nope.'"

  "I did."

  Jerry laughed nervously. "Mr. Ed, I presume? Or Francis?"

  "Nope. Don't know Mr. Ed or Francis."

  It was too dark to be shooting footage for Candid Camera, so Jerry 
ruled that possibility out. More than likely, this was a bad dream.

  "Scratch my ear," the moose said from a couple of feet away. The 
black cat wrapped its tail around one of the moose's legs and purred 
loudly. The moose stomped its foot. The cat batted back at the leg.

  "Don't do that," Jerry warned the cat.

  "I wouldn't, but this is fun," the cat replied.

  "Don't pay him no mind," the moose said.

  Jerry backed away from the two and sat on a cold tombstone. The 
insanity was getting to him. A full moon broke through the clouds 
and lit the area.

  The moose and cat stood there, next to the open grave and the leg, 
staring at him. The moose looked like it was smiling.

  "I'm not hallucinating, am I?"

  The moose looked at the cat with a dumb look. The cat looked back 
and asked, "Should we tell him?"

  "You can. I'm hungry." The moose turned and stepped into the open 
grave. "Oops!" it said as it scrambled to keep its footing. It wandered 
away, muttering something nasty about open graves.

  Jerry ventured, "What's with the grave?"

  The cat looked from Jerry to the grave and back. "It's there."

  "I mean, why is it open?"

  "To catch mice?" The cat trotted over the grave and looked in. Then 
sat and started licking itself.

  Jerry thought about the situation as he watched the cat. This had 
to be his imagination and he'd soon wake up. If anything, it was a bit 
comic. He chuckled at the idea of a talking cat and moose. Dumb, totally 
dumb.

  The cat stopped licking itself. "Not scared?" it asked.

  "More like amused. You're like a bad trip."

  "Oh, one of those," the cat replied, putting emphasis on the last 
word. "I'll have you know that we are not the result of drugs."

  "Uh, a figment of my imagination?"

  "No. Pinch yourself."

  "What?"

  "Pinch yourself," the cat repeated. "If you can feel pain . . ."

  "I don't want to."

  The cat growled and then hissed at him. Jerry eyed the cat 
apprehensively. It sprang at him. "Hey!" Jerry yelled as he dodged the 
cat and fell off the tombstone.

  The cat squalled again and leapt for Jerry's face. This time, Jerry 
wasn't fast enough. As he got to his feet, Jerry felt his face where 
the cat had struck and drew away wet sticky stuff. It tasted like salt 
-- blood! And it hurt! "Oh god!" Jerry swore.

  "God won't help you here," the moose replied. It was back.

  Jerry backed away from the moose and into something solid. Wooden, 
but solid. The smell of rotting flesh hit his nose. It was the outhouse.

  "I'm dreaming," he said. "I've got to be dreaming!"

  The cat squalled and leapt at him again, this time drawing a long 
scratch down his arm. That hurt more than the scratch on his face.

  "What the hell?" Jerry screamed, grabbing his arm. The slash was deep 
and hurt.

  The cat laughed at him. "I'm you worst nightmare, Jerry Jerk!"

  "Jerry Jerk? Wh-what do you mean?"

  "Don't you remember me?" the cat replied. "I was your pet cat and you
tortured me."

  This was a big mistake. He tried to pinch the edges of the scratch on 
his arm together. "I never had a cat. I never had any pets," he gasped. 
"You've got the wrong Jerry.

  "That's what the other Jerry said," the moose offered.

  "Wh-what other Jerry?"

  "The Jerry on the ground," the moose added, bending its big head down 
to nose the leg.

  "That's only a leg," Jerry replied horrified. The image of a badly
mutilated body, sans leg, sprung into his mind's eye.

  "You got the image wrong." The cat was on top of a nearby tombstone. 
"The body has no legs or arms. It's just a body and a head. Like a 
pumpkin."

  "And some dumb bird," the moose added, "saying, `Nevermore, nevermore.'"

  "Poe," Jerry suggested, recognizing the reference.

  "Yeah, Jerry Poe," the cat said. "That was his name."

  "Edgar Allen Poe," Jerry corrected.

  "Whatever." The cat was licking itself again.

  Jerry edged away, wary of the cat. It looked at him and squalled. 
Jerry jumped. The cat went back to licking himself.

  From a nearby tree, a bird said, "Nevermore."

  "Look," Jerry said, "I told you I never owned a cat, I never had a pet 
cat, I never liked cats!"

  "So?" the cat replied. "The feeling's mutual."
    
  "But why?"

  "Why is to reason. Why is to die. You reason, you die!" the cat 
intoned in an evil voice that dripped with blood.

  A thought struck Jerry. Why not just walk back to his car and drive 
home?

  "You'll never find it," the cat said, reading his mind.

  "Like hell," Jerry growled.

  He headed away from the pair - trio, counting the bird in the tree.

  It didn't take him long.  Somehow, the cemetery had become its own 
little world. A world that didn't go very far without you coming right 
back to where you started. Jerry didn't like that kind of world. The 
trio was still there. Well, thought Jerry, "_At least I haven't run 
into the pumpkin_."

  "No?" the cat laughed. "Just wait. A head and a body."

  "Thanks," Jerry replied worriedly. His arm still hurt and was now 
very tender to the touch. Maybe if he concentrated on the tombstones, 
they'd go away. But the cat had settled on top of one and was watching 
him, its tail swishing the air behind him in a nervous way. And the 
moose was smiling again.

  Jerry looked at the name on the marker. Gerald Cummings. He went to 
the next tombstone. Gerry Smith. Died young.

  Jerry moved to the next marker. Another Jerry. Last name of King. 
Probably someone related to the rail lines, since the marker had tracks 
running around the edge.

  "You should relate to him," the moose offered.

  "Nevermore," the bird said.

  "He was a writer, too," the cat said. "But he didn't have problems 
with writer's block."

  Jerry glanced at them. He moved to the next marker. Jerry Shelley.

  He looked to see where he was. He was working his way toward the open
grave. The next marker read Jerry Price. Another, Gerrold Bradbury. He 
read on. Rice, Lugosi, Arness, Romero, Carpenter, Milland, Serling, and 
a dozen others. All related to monsters or horror in one way or another. 
All with a first name of Gerry, Jerry, Gerald, Gerrold, Jerold, or 
something similar.

  One more stone, with some dark substance smeared across it. He felt 
the letters - Poe. Jerry Poe. "Right," Jerry said to himself. "This is 
not only insanity, it isn't even close to being right. These people 
weren't named Jerry."

  "But they lived in a world of fear, in a world of nightmares," the 
moose offered ominously.

  "And you're Bullwinkle," Jerry spat out, thinking insanity for insanity.

  "Hey," the moose said in a bright, but dumb voice, "I resemble that 
remark. Wanna see what I got in the hat?"

  Jerry ignored him and walked over to the open grave, stepping 
carefully over the disembodied leg. As he bent to look at the marker, 
the cat jumped on his back and then to the top of the stone.

  Jerry looked at the cat. Why not just shove me in? The pain in his 
arm reminded him of reality. The pain was now working its way up toward 
his shoulder. And the name on the stone wasn't his. In fact, it wasn't a 
Jerry. It was Rodney.

  "We never said it had to make sense," the cat said between licks of 
its paw. "How's the arm?"

  "Hurts like hell," Jerry growled.

  "Give it a bit, and it'll stop," the moose offered.

  "Nevermore," the bird said from the tree.

  The cat stared up at the bird. "One of these days . . ."

  As it flew away, the bird cried out, "Nevermore."

  Jerry gingerly touched his shoulder. It hurt like someone was 
tightening a wire around his joint. "I suppose that your claws had some 
sort of poison in them?"

  "Nah, nothing like that," the moose said. "You'll see."

  "You know," the cat said, looking curiously at the moose, "you really 
ought to try to get a girl."

  "Why?"

  "I like to watch."

  "Who should we go after?"

  The pain in Jerry's shoulder was growing worse. Sweat was beading on 
his forehead.

  "Gloria?" the cat asked.

  "You've got a thing with G's," the moose replied.

  "Hits the spot - especially with girls."

  "Very funny and droll."

  Jerry couldn't concentrate. The wire in his shoulder was tightening,
tightening, tightening.

  The cat and the moose continued to exchange insanities about girls and
wanting to have one next.

  "_Next? NEXT?_," Jerry thought, as he stared at the cat.

  The cat stopped talking and smiled. It looked insanely like something 
from Alice in Wonderland.

  "What do you mean, next?" Jerry got out between gasps of pain.

  "You're not very bright," the moose replied.

  Off in the distance, the bird squawked "Nevermore."

  Jerry sat heavily on a nearby marker. The cold stone felt good, but 
the sudden jar hurt his shoulder. The pain was close to intolerable and 
he moaned softly at it, wishing it'd go away.

  The cat laughed and the moose guffawed.

  "I know a girl," the cat offered soberly. "She's an aspiring writer, 
too."

  "Oh?"

  "Not bad looking, for her age."

  "How old and where's she live?"

  "In her thirties - in the Northern Lights Apartments."

  The pain was deep and his fingers were growing numb. The scratch was 
like a flaming sword, buried in his flesh.

  "I know where that is," the moose replied.

  "See if you can spot her, then."

  "Okay, but after the show."

  "Of course." The cat and moose turned their attention back to Jerry.

  Jerry clung to his throbbing left arm. The pain in his shoulder was 
deep, but not as sharp. The numbness was working its way into his hand,
alternately tingling, and then going numb again.

  "Are you left-handed, Jerry?" the cat asked.

  Jerry shook his head, in too much pain to say anything.

  "If your fingers are getting numb, it won't be much longer," the moose
said.

  Jerry was sweating profusely. The chatter between the moose and cat 
didn't make sense.

  "At least he isn't wearing a tapered shirt with long sleeves," the cat
observed.

  "Short sleeve shirts are okay," the moose said. "I prefer a sleeveless 
top and shorts."

  "Well, by the time this is over with, maybe you can lure that girl up 
here in a bathing suit. That would amuse me."

  "You are morbid."

  "Naturally."

  His hand was numb, and the forearm hurt worse than ever. It was like 
all the pain from the hand and fingers and arm were concentrated in that 
one spot. Oh, if he could only sever the pain, pull off his arm, or 
something.

  The moose approached and nipped at him.

  "Hey!" Jerry said, jumping to his feet.

  "You need to move around," the moose replied.

  "Oh, sure," Jerry said, "like into that grave."

  The moose tilted its head. "It is a thought."

  The cat ran between Jerry's legs. "Showtime," he said as he purposely
tripped him.

  Jerry flung out his arms, grabbing for anything to keep his balance. 
He was close to a tall marker - the one that had Poe on it. Despite the 
pain, he grabbed for it with his left hand, as he sprawled on the ground 
the pain was suddenly gone from his arm. Jerry scrambled up and then 
stopped as the familiar smell hit him.

Someone's arm was on the ground . . . raw at one end. 

Jerry stared at his empty sleeve, flapping loosely where his arm used 
to be.

  "One down, three to go, and pumpkin time!" the cat said with 
satisfaction.

  "Maybe a leg next?" the moose said with idle curiosity.

  The cat nodded, slowly advancing on Jerry and growling ever so low.

  And the bird said, "Nevermore."

                        THE SNOW QUEEN

   Once upon a time a magician made a magic mirror. In this mirror, a kind
face became wicked, a look of hate was reflected as a look of love. One day, 
however, the mirror broke, and if a sliver of glass from the mirror entered
someone's eye, that person's soul became evil, if another pierced a heart, 
that heart grew hard and cold as ice.
   In a big town two children, called Karl and Gerda were very close friends, 
and even the sweet pea that grew on Karl's window sill spread across the
street to entwine with Gerda's little rose bush. One evening Karl was watching
the snow drift down, when he noticed a white flake slowly turn into a
beautiful ice maiden. Karl was startled to hear the ice maiden speak his name,
and he was not to know he had set eyes on the Snow Queen. Winter passed, and
one spring afternoon, as Karl and Gerda pored over a book, the little boy told
her: "I feel a pain in my heart! And something's pricking my eye!"
  " Don t worry, said Gerda comfortingly. "I can't see anything!" But, alas, 
splinters from the shattered mirror had pierced the little boy.
   Now in the grip of the evil spell, he snapped: "You're so ugly!" And
ripping two roses from her bush, he ran off. From that day on, Karl turned
into a very nasty boy, and nobody could understand what had happened to him to
cause such a change. Only Gerda still loved him, though all she got in return 
were insults and spite.                                                79
   Winter came round again, though earlier than usual, and bringing far more
snow than anyone could remember.
   One day, just after going outdoors to play in the snow, Karl saw the
beautiful maiden he had seen that night, coming towards him wrapped in a white
fur coat. She stood in front of him and told him to tie his sledge to her own,
drawn by a white horse. Then they sped away. Suddenly, the great sledge soared
into the sky and through the clouds. Stretched out on his own little sledge, 
Karl didn't dare move a muscle for fear of falling into space. At last, they
came to a halt on an immense white plain, dotted with lots of sparkling frozen
lakes.
   "Come into my arms," said the Snow Queen, opening her soft fur coat. "Come
and keep warm!"
   Karl allowed himself to be hugged by the unknown maiden and a chill ran up
his spine as two icy lips touched his forehead. The Snow Queen kissed him
again, and in an instant, the little boy forgot all about Gerda and his past
life, as he fell into a deep sleep.
   In the meantime, Gerda was anxiously searching for Karl, but no one had
seen him. Finally, she went down to the river.
   "Great river," she said, "please tell me if you've seen Karl or if you've
carried him away! I'll give you these, if you do!" And she threw her shoes
into the river. But the current paid no heed and just swept them back to the
bank. Not far away stood an old boat, and Gerda climbed into it. As she
drifted with the current, she pleaded: "Great river, silently flowing and
knowing all things about men's lives, take me to Karl."
   At dusk, she stopped by a river bank carpeted with all kinds of flowers. 
After resting she went into the forest, and though she did not know how she
would ever find her friend, a mysterious voice inside her told her to be
brave. After wandering far and wide, she stopped, tired and hungry. A crow
flapped out from a hollow tree.
   "If you're looking for Karl," it said, "I know where he is! I saw him with
the Snow Queen on her sledge in the sky!"
   "And where is her kingdom?" Gerda asked the crow.
   "In Lapland, where all is icy cold. That reindeer over there might take
you! "
   Gerda ran over to the big reindeer, threw her arms around its neck and, 
laying her cheek against its soft muzzle, said: "Please help me to find my
friend!" The reindeer's kindly eyes told her that he would, and she climbed
onto its back. They travelled till they came to the frozen tundra, lit by the
fiery glow of the Northern Lights.
   "Karl! Karl! Where are you?" shouted Gerda as loudly as she could. When, at
last, she found the little boy, Karl did not recognize her. Gerda threw her
arms round him, and teardrops dripped onto his chest and heart. This broke the
evil spell. Karl woke from his long sleep, and when he set eyes on Gerda, he
too began to cry. The second cold splinter of mirror vanished. They had found
each other again at last, thanks to Gerda's love, and the reindeer galloped
them home. The two plants on the window sills started to blossom again and to
twine, a sign of their everlasting friendship.

                                        New Story
=========================================================================================
                       THE SLEEPING PRINCESS

   Once upon a time there was a Queen who had a beautiful baby daughter. She 
asked all the fairies in the kingdom to the christening, but unfortunately 
forgot to invite one of them, who was a bit of a witch as well. She came 
anyway, but as she passed the baby's cradle, she said:
   "When you are sixteen, you will injure yourself with a spindle and die!"
   "Oh, no!" screamed the Queen in horror. A good fairy quickly chanted a 
magic spell to change the curse. When she hurt herself, the girl would fall 
into a very deep sleep instead of dying.
   The years went by, the little Princess grew and became the most beautiful 
girl in the whole kingdom. Her mother was always very careful to keep her away
from spindles, but the Princess, on her sixteenth birthday, as she wandered 
through the castle, came into a room where an old servant was spinning.
   "What are you doing?" she asked the servant.
   "I'm spinning. Haven't you seen a spindle before?"
   "No. Let me see it!" The servant handed the girl the spindle ... and she 
pricked herself with it and. with a sigh, dropped to the floor.
   The terrified old woman hurried to tell the Queen. Beside herself with 
anguish, the Queen did her best to awaken her daughter but in vain. The court 
doctors and wizards were called, but there was nothing they could do. The girl
could not be wakened from her deep sleep. The good fairy who managed to avoid 
the worst of the curse came too, and the Queen said to her,
   "When will my daughter waken?"
   "I don't know," the fairy admitted sadly.
   "In a year's time, ten years or twenty?" the Queen went on.
   "Maybe in a hundred years' time. Who knows?" said the fairy.
   "Oh! What would make her waken?" asked the Queen weeplng.
   "Love," replied the fairy. "If a man of pure heart were to fall in love 
with her, that would bring her back to life!"
   "How can a man fall in love with a sleeping girl?" sobbed the Queen, and so
heart-broken was she that, a few days later, she died. The sleeping Princess 
was taken to her room and laid on the bed surrounded by garlands of flowers. 
She was so beautiful, with a sweet face, not like those of the dead, but pink 
like those who are sleeping peacefully. The good fairy said to herself,
   "When she wakens, who is she going to see around her? Strange faces and 
people she doesn't know? I can never let that happen. It would be too painful 
for this unfortunate girl."
   So the fairy cast a spell; and everyone that lived in the castle - 
soldiers, ministers, guards, servants, ladies, pages, cooks, maids and 
knights - all fell into a deep sleep, wherever they were at that very moment.
   "Now," thought the fairy, "when the Princess wakes up, they too will 
awaken, and life will go on from there." And she left the castle, now wrapped 
in silence. Not a sound was to be heard, nothing moved except for the clocks, 
but when they too ran down, they stopped, and time stopped with them. Not even
the faintest rustle was to be heard, only the wind whistling round the 
turrets, not a single voice, only the cry of birds.
   The years sped past. In the castle grounds, the trees grew tall. The bushes
became thick and straggling, the grass invaded the courtyards and the creepers
spread up the walls. In a hundred years, a dense forest grew up.
   Now, it so happened that a Prince arrived in these parts. He was the son of
a king in a country close by. Young, handsome and melancholy, he sought in 
solitude everything he could not find in the company of other men: serenity, 
sincerity and purity. Wandering on his trusty steed he arrived, one day, at 
the dark forest. Being adventurous, he decided to explore it. He made his way 
through slowly and with a struggle, for the trees and bushes grew in a thick 
tangle. A few hours later, now losing heart, he was about to turn his horse 
and go back when he thought he could see something through the trees . . . He 
pushed back the branches . . . Wonder of wonders! There in front of him stood 
a castle with high towers. The young man stood stock still in amazement,
   "I wonder who this castle belongs to?" he thought.
   The young Prince rode on towards the castle. The drawbridge was down and, 
holding his horse by the reins, he crossed over it. Immediately he saw the 
inhabitants draped all over the steps, the halls and courtyards, and said to 
himself,
   "Good heavens! They're dead!" But in a moment, he realised that they were 
sound asleep. "Wake up! Wake up!" he shouted, but nobody moved. Still 
thoroughly astonished, he went into the castle and again discovered more 
people, lying fast asleep on the floor. As though led by a hand in the 
complete silence, the Prince finally reached the room where the beautiful 
Princess lay fast asleep. For a long time he stood gazing at her face, so full
of serenity, so peaceful, lovely and pure, and he felt spring to his heart 
that love he had always been searching for and never found. Overcome by 
emotion, he went close, lifted the girl's little white hand and gently kissed 
it . . .
   At that kiss, the prlncess qulckly opened her eyes, and wakening from her 
long long sleep, seeing the Prince beside her, murmured:
   "Oh, you have come at last! I was waiting for you in my dream. I've waited 
so long!"
   Just then, the spell was broken. The Princess rose to her feet, holding out
her hand to the Prince. And the whole castle woke up too. Everybody rose to 
their feet and they all stared round in amazement, wondering what had 
happened. When they finally realised, they rushed to the Princess, more 
beautiful and happier then ever.
   A few days later, the castle that only a short time before had lain in 
silence, now rang with the sound of singing, music and happy laughter at the 
great party given in honour of the Prince and Princess, who were getting 
married. They lived happily ever after, as they always do in fairy tales, not 
quite so often, however, in real life.

                               No Option Left
                            by G. Daniel Flower

          Before you say anything, I know what I did was wrong. I
     freely admit that. Can I but wish that it had never happened.
     Unfortunately, the hands of time continue to move forward,
     turning back for no man.
          I am not a criminal, you know that. Sure, there were the
     few shoplifting incidents when I was younger, but Susan had seen
     me one day. Needless to say, you were hardly amused by the
     situation.
          Other than that I only have a few traffic tickets on my
     record. Up until now I have been proud of that fact.
          It is amazing what a man will do when his back is against
     the wall. I could have lived with paying six hundred dollars a
     month in child support; I could have lived with the three
     hundred dollar reduction in salary due to that transfer; I could
     have lived with the forclosure of the house (after all, I wasn't
     living there anymore because of the transfer).
          But I couldn't live with the fact that Loretta moved back
     with her parents because she wanted to get a college degree, and
     I couldn't help her.
          I know that it is passe these days for a man to feel as if
     he has to be the sole bread winner in a family, but not being
     able to afford to give Loretta what she wanted really hurt. The
     least I could have done would be to take care of the bills so
     she could put her salary towards her degree.
          Here we were, scrimping and saving to makie ends meet, and
     not even married yet. I only wanted the best for her. I tried to
     remain cheerful and supportive when she told me what her plan
     was. I even tried to make it work for a couple of months.
          But again, money problems entered the picture. I just
     didn't have the money to see her every weekend. Lonliness set
     in.
          Things probably would have stayed the same, going to see
     her when I could, just getting by, if I hadn't had that crazy
     idea.
          I never would have had the idea if I hadn't gone to the ATM
     machine that day. It wasn't a machine I normally use. I try to
     use the one at my bank. I was at the mall and needed some money
     for gas, so I decided I'd use the machine at the mall and get
     gas on the way home.
          Anyway, while I was making my withdrawal they came to fill
     the machine. I'd always wondered how they did it, and now I
     knew.
          The idea didn't come to me right away, at least not to my
     conscious mind. It wasn't until I was home that the lightning
     struck. I was looking at my bills, wondering how I was going to
     pay them, when the thought came to me.
          Why not ambush the team that fills the ATM machines?
          I argued with myself for days, and needless to say it was
     an argument that I lost.
          The plan was simplicity in itself. Wait by the machine
     until they came to fill it and then take the money. All I needed
     was a gun and a time schedule for when the filled the machines.
     Two people had filled the machine that day at the mall. One
     carried a brief case and the other was an armed, uniformed
     guard. I figured that if I got the drop on them there would be
     no problem.
          I went to a gun shop and bought a .380 Baretta
     Semi-automatic. I'd used one before and it fit the bill nicely.
     It was small and light weight, but looked ugly enough to get
     someone's attention. I didn't bother to try to use an alias, I
     wasn't planning on using it. If it came to that I'd hightail it
     out of there and think of something else.
          It took ten days to get the gun, because the police had to
     do a check on me to make sure I wasn't an ex-con or something.
     While I waited for the gun I watched the ATM machine.
          I decided to go with the machine at the mall. It was
     located near a side exit, and that end of the mall wasn't too
     busy during the day. I wasn't in a hurry and could wait until
     there weren't too many people nearby. I discovered that they
     came every other day to fill the machine, and that they came at
     the same time.
          The gun was ready the day the shop keeper had promised. I
     went in and tested it out on the indoor range, more because it
     was expected of me than anything else. I was finally ready.
          I went to the mall and waited. I made sure that I had used
     a different location to watch from everyday so that I wouldn't
     attract attention. My opportunity came on the third visit.
          There was no one near the machine, and I had to time it so
     that I arrived at the machine before the person with the brief
     case went into the service area in the back to fill the machine.
     It went just like I planned, neither one made a fuss when I
     showed them the gun. I took the guard's gun and had them face
     the wall. I told them I'd kill them if they made a sound, and to
     count to two hundred before moving.
          I was shaking as I drove away. I'd never been that scared.
     I started shaking again after I counted the money. $85,000. Not
     bad for a day's work, and more than enough to put Loretta
     through college.
          She caught a ride up with one of her friends today, in
     order to spend the weekend with me. I bought some nice steaks
     and a bottle of wine. After we'd eaten, I explained what I'd
     done, and why. I'd thought about what I'd say to her to explain
     my sudden windfall, and decided to tell her the truth. I can't
     lie to her.
          I really though she'd be happy, but she wasn't. She called
     me a scum, and a few other choice explatives. She told me I had
     to turn myself in, or she'd do it herself.
          I guess I lost my head. After all, I had done it for us, so
     we could be together. She had no reason to be so mad. I hit her.
     She fell and hit her head on the table.
          It didn't take me long to sober up after that. She was
     dead. I couldn't believe it. I picked her up and carried her
     into the bedroom. I laid her gently in the bed and looked at her
     for what seems hours, but what was probably closer to five
     minutes.
          Then I sat down and wrote this to you. There's not much
     left to do, Mom. I'll call the police first, of course. I don't
     want us to be found in a few days, and I don't know if the
     neighbhors will hear the shot from the .380.
          I guess there's nothing left to say, except I'm sorry. Give
     my love to everyone for me.

                                        Your Loving Son

          The Adventure of the Six Napoleons

  It was no very unusual thing for Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland
Yard, to look in upon us of an evening, and his visits were wel-
come to Sherlock Holmes, for they enabled him to keep in touch
with all that was going on at the police headquarters. In return
for the news which Lestrde would bring, Holmes was always
ready to listen with attention to the details of any case upon
which the detective was engaged, and was able occasionally
without any active interference, to give some hint or suggestion
drawn from his own vast knowledge and experience.
  On this particular evening, Lestrade had spoken of the weather
and the newspapers. Then he had fallen silent, puffing thoughtfully
at his cigar. Holmes looked keenly at him.
  "Anything remarkable on hand?" he asked.
  "Oh, no, Mr. Holmes -- nothing very particular."
  "Then tell me about it."
  Lestrade laughed.
  "Well, Mr. Holmes, there is no use denying that there is
something on my mind. And yet it is such an absurd business,
that I hesitated to bother you about it. On the other hand,
although it is trivial, it is undoubtedly queer, and I know that
you have a taste for all that is out of the common. But, in my
opinion, it comes more in Dr. Watson's line than ours."
  "Disease?" said I.
  "Madness, anyhow. And a queer madness, too. You wouldn't
think there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a
hatred of Napoleon the First that he would break any image of
him that he could see."
  Holmes sank back in his chair.
  "That's no business of mine," said he.
  "Exactly. That's what I said. But then, when the man com-
mits burglary in order to break images which are not his own,
that brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman."
  Holmes sat up again.
  "Burglary! This is more interesting. Let me hear the details."
  Lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his mem-
ory from its pages.
  "The first case reported was four days ago," said he. "It was
at the shop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of
pictures and statues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had
left the front shop for an instant, when he heard a crash, and
hurrying in he found a plaster bust of Napoleon, which stood
with several other works of art upon the counter, lying shivered
into fragments. He rushed out into the road, but, although sev-
eral passers-by declared that they had noticed a man run out of
the shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he find any
means of identifying the rascal. It seemed to be one of those
senseless acts of Hooliganism which occur from time to time,
and it was reported to the constable on the beat as such. The
plaster cast was not worth more than a few shillings, and the
whole affair appeared to be too childish for any particular
investigation.
  "The second case, however, was more serious, and also more
singular. It occurred only last night.
  "In Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of
Morse Hudson's shop, there lives a well-known medical practi-
tioner, named Dr. Barnicot, who has one of the largest practices
upon the south side of the Thames. His residence and principal
consulting-room is at Kennington Road, but he has a branch
surgery and dispensary at Lower Brixton Road, two miles away.
This Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his
house is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French Em-
peror. Some little time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson
two duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of Napoleon by
the French sculptor, Devine. One of these he placed in his hall in
the house at Kennington Road, and the other on the mantelpiece
of the surgery at Lower Brixton. Well, when Dr. Barnicot came
down this morning he was astonished to find that his house had
been burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken
save the plaster head from the hall. It had been carried out and
had been dashed savagely against the garden wall, under which
its splintered fragments were discovered."
  Holmes rubbed his hands.
  "This is certainly very novel," said he.
  "I thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end
yet. Dr. Barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o'clock, and
you can imagine his amazement when, on arriving there, he
found that the window had been opened in the night, and that the
broken pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room.
It had been smashed to atoms where it stood. In neither case
were there any signs which could give us a clue as to the
criminal or lunatic who had done the mischief. Now, Mr. Holmes,
you have got the facts."
  "They are singular, not to say grotesque," said Holmes.
"May I ask whether the two busts smashed in Dr. Barnicot's
rooms were the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed
in Morse Hudson's shop?"
  "They were taken from the same mould."
  "Such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who
breaks them is influenced by any general hatred of Napoleon.
Considering how many hundreds of statues of the great Emperor
must exist in London, it is too much to suppose such a coinci-
dence as that a promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin
upon three specimens of the same bust."
  "Well, I thought as you do," said Lestrade. "On the other
hand, this Morse Hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of
London, and these three were the only ones which had been in
his shop for years. So, although, as you say, there are many
hundreds of statues in London, it is very probable that these
three were the only ones in that district. Therefore, a local
fanatic would begin with them. What do you think, Dr. Watson?"
  "There are no limits to the possibilities of monomania," I
answered. "There is the condition which the modern French
psychologists have called the 'idee fixe,' which may be trifling in
character, and accompanied by complete sanity in every other
way. A man who had read deeply about Napoleon, or who had
possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great
war, might conceivably form such an idee fixe and under its
influence be capable of any fantastic outrage."
  "That won't do, my dear Watson," said Holmes, shaking his
head, "for no amount of idee fixe would enable your interesting
monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated."
  "Well, how do you explain it?"
  "I don't attempt to do so. I would only observe that there is a
certain method in the gentleman's eccentric proceedings. For
example, in Dr. Barnicot's hall, where a sound might arouse the
family, the bust was taken outside before being broken, whereas
in the surgery, where there was less danger of an alarm, it was
smashed where it stood. The affair seems absurdly trifling, and
yet I dare call nothing trivial when I reflect that some of my most
classic cases have had the least promising commencement. You
will remember, Watson, how the dreadful business of the Abernetty
family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the
parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. I can't afford,
therefore, to smile at your three broken busts, Lestrade, and I
shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any
fresh development of so singular a chain of events."

  The development for which my friend had asked came in a
quicker and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have
imagined. I was still dressing in my bedroom next morning,
when there was a tap at the door and Holmes entered, a
telegram in his hand. He read it aloud:

     "Come instantly, 131 Pitt Street, Kensington.
                                        "LESTRADE.

  "What is it, then?" I asked.
  "Don't know -- may be anything. But I suspect it is the sequel
of the story of the statues. In that case our friend the image-
breaker has begun operations in another quarter of London.
There's coffee on the table, Watson, and I have a cab at the
door."
  In half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a quiet little
backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of London life.
No. 131 was one of a row, all flat-chested, respectable, and
most unromantic dwellings. As we drove up, we found the rail-
ings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd. Holmes
whistled.
  "By George! it's attempted murder at the least. Nothing less
will hold the London message-boy. There's a deed of violence
indicated in that fellow's round shoulders and outstretched
neck. What's this, Watson? The top steps swilled down and
the other ones dry. Footsteps enough, anyhow! Well, well,
there's Lestrade at the front window, and we shall soon know
all about it."
  The official received us with a very grave face and showed us
into a sitting-room, where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated el-
derly man, clad in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and
down. He was introduced to us as the owner of the house -- Mr.
Horace Harker, of the Central Press Syndicate.
  "It's the Napoleon bust business again," said Lestrade. "You
seemed interested last night, Mr. Holmes, so I thought perhaps
you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a
very much graver turn."
  "What has it turned to, then?"
  "To murder. Mr. Harker, will you tell these gentlemen ex-
actly what has occurred?"
  The man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most mel-
ancholy face.
  "It's an extraordinary thing," said he, "that all my life I have
been collecting other people's news, and now that a real piece of
news has come my own way I am so confused and bothered that
I can't put two words together. If I had come in here as a
journalist, I should have interviewed myself and had two col-
umns in every evening paper. As it is, I am giving away valu-
able copy by telling my story over and over to a string of
different people, and I can make no use of it myself. However,
I've heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and if you'll only
explain this queer business, I shall be paid for my trouble in
telling you the story."
  Holmes sat down and listened.
  "It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I
bought for this very room about four months ago. I picked it up
cheap from Harding Brothers, two doors from the High Street
Station. A great deal of my journalistic work is done at night,
and I often write until the early morning. So it was to-day. I was
sitting in my den, which is at the back of the top of the house,
about three o'clock, when I was convinced that l heard some
sounds downstairs. I listened, but they were not repeated, and I
concluded that they came from outside. Then suddenly, about
five minutes later, there came a most horrible yell -- the most
dreadful sound, Mr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring in my
ears as long as I live. I sat frozen with horror for a minute or
two. Then I seized the poker and went downstairs. When I
entered this room I found the window wide open, and I at once
observed that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece. Why any
burglar should take such a thing passes my understanding, for it
was only a plaster cast and of no real value whatever.
  "You can see for yourself that anyone going out through that
open window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long
stride. This was clearly what the burglar had done, so I went
round and opened the door. Stepping out into the dark, I nearly
fell over a dead man, who was lying there. I ran back for a light,
and there was the poor fellow, a great gash in his throat and the
whole place swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his knees
drawn up, and his mouth horribly open. I shall see him in my
dreams. I had just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I
must have fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the
policeman standing over me in the hall."
  "Well, who was the murdered man?" asked Holmes.
  "There's nothing to show who he was," said Lestrade. "You
shall see the body at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of
it up to now. He is a tall man, sunburned, very powerful, not
more than thirty. He is poorly dressed, and yet does not appear
to be a labourer. A horn-handled clasp knife was lying in a pool
of blood beside him. Whether it was the weapon which did the
deed, or whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not know.
There was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets
save an apple, some string, a shilling map of London, and a
photograph. Here it is."
  It was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera. It
represented an alert, sharp-featured simian man. with thick eye-
brows and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the
face, like the muzzle of a baboon.
  "And what became of the bust?" asked Holmes, after a
careful study of this picture.
  "We had news of it just before you came. It has been found in
the front garden of an empty house in Campden House Road. It
was broken into fragments. I am going round now to see it. Will
you come?"
  "Certainly. I must just take one look round." He examined
the carpet and the window. "The fellow had either very long
legs or was a most active man," said he. "With an area beneath,
it was no mean feat to reach that window-ledge and open that
window. Getting back was comparatively simple. Are you com-
ing with us to see the remains of your bust, Mr. Harker?"
  The disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a writing-table.
  "I must try and make something of it," said he, "though I
have no doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out
already with full details. It's like my luck! You remember when
the stand fell at Doncaster? Well, I was the only journalist in the
stand, and my journal the only one that had no account of it, for
I was too shaken to write it. And now I'll be too late with a
murder done on my own doorstep."
  As we left the room, we heard his pen travelling shrilly over
the foolscap.
  The spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was
only a few hundred yards away. For the first time our eyes rested
upon this presentment of the great emperor, which seemed to
raise such frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the
unknown. It lay scattered, in splintered shards, upon the grass.
Holmes picked up several of them and examined them carefully.
I was convinced, from his intent face and his purposeful manner,
that at last he was upon a clue.
  "Well?" asked Lestrade.
  Holmes shrugged his shoulders.
  "We have a long way to go yet," said he. "And yet -- and
yet -- well, we have some suggestive facts to act upon. The
possession of this trifling bust was worth more, in the eyes of
this strange criminal, than a human life. That is one point. Then
there is the singular fact that he did not break it in the house, or
immediately outside the house, if to break it was his sole object."
  "He was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow. He
hardly knew what he was doing."
  "Well, that's likely enough. But I wish to call your attention
very particularly to the position of this house, in the garden of
which the bust was destroyed."
  Lestrade looked about him.
  "It was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be
disturbed in the garden."
  "Yes, but there is another empty house farther up the street
which he must have passed before he came to this one. Why did
he not break it there, since it is evident that every yard that he
carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him?"
  "I give it up," said Lestrade.
  Holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads.
  "He could see what he was doing here, and he could not
there. That was his reason."
  "By Jove! that's true," said the detective. "Now that I come
to think of it, Dr. Barnicot's bust was broken not far from his red
lamp. Well, Mr. Holmes, what are we to do with that fact?"
  "To remember it -- to docket it. We may come on something
later which will bear upon it. What steps do you propose to take
now, Lestrade?"
  "The most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to
identify the dead man. There should be no difficulty about that.
When we have found who he is and who his associates are, we
should have a good start in learning what he was doing in Pitt
Street last night, and who it was who met him and killed him on
the doorstep of Mr. Horace Harker. Don't you think so?"
  "No doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should
approach the case."
  "What would you do then?"
  "Oh, you must not let me influence you in any way. I suggest
that you go on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes
afterwards, and each will supplement the other."
  "Very good," said Lestrade.
  "If you are going back to Pitt Street, you might see Mr.
Horace Harker. Tell him for me that I have quite made up my
mind, and that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic,
with Napoleonic delusions, was in his house last night. It will be
useful for his article."
  Lestrade stared.
  "You don't seriously believe that?"
  Holmes smiled.
  "Don't I? Well, perhaps I don't. But I am sure that it will
interest Mr. Horace Harker and the subscribers of the Central
Press Syndicate. Now, Watson, I think that we shall find that we
have a long and rather complex day's work before us. I should
be glad, Lestrade, if you could make it convenient to meet us at
Baker Street at six o'clock this evening. Until then I should like
to keep this photograph, found in the dead man's pocket. It is
possible that I may have to ask your company and assistance
upon a small expedition which will have to be undertaken to-
night, if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. Until
then good-bye and good luck!"
  Sherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street,
where we stopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the
bust had been purchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr.
Harding would be absent until afternoon, and that he was himself
a newcomer, who could give us no information. Holmes's face
showed his disappointment and annoyance.
  "Well, well, we can't expect to have it all our own way,
Watson," he said, at last. "We must come back in the after-
noon, if Mr. Harding will not be here until then. I am, as you
have no doubt surmised, endeavouring to trace these busts to
their source, in order to find if there is not something peculiar
which may account for their remarkable fate. Let us make for
Mr. Morse Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see if he can
throw any light upon the problem."
  A drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer's establish-
ment. He was a small, stout man with a red face and a peppery
manner.
  "Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir," said he. "What we pay
rates and taxes for I don't know, when any ruffian can come in
and break one's goods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot
his two statues. Disgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot -- that's what I
make it. No one but an anarchist would go about breaking
statues. Red republicans -- that's what I call 'em. Who did I get
the statues from? I don't see what that has to do with it. Welll, if
you really want to know, I got them from Gelder & Co., in
Church Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the
trade, and have been this twenty years. How many had l?
Three -- two and one are three -- two of Dr. Barnicot's, and one
smashed in broad daylight on my own counter. Do I know that
photograph? No, I don't. Yes, I do, though. Why, it's Beppo.
He was a kind of Italian piece-work man, who made himself
useful in the shop. He could carve a bit, and gild and frame, and
do odd jobs. The fellow left me last week, and I've heard
nothing of him since. No, I don't know where he came from nor
where he went to. I had nothing against him while he was here.
He was gone two days before the bust was smashed."
  "Well, that's all we could reasonably expect from Morse
Hudson," said Holmes, as we emerged from the shop. "We
have this Beppo as a common factor, both in Kennington and in
Kensington, so that is worth a ten-mile drive. Now, Watson, let
us make for Gelder & Co., of Stepney, the source and origin of
the busts. I shall be surprised if we don't get some help down
there."
  In rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashion-
able London, hotel London, theatrical London, literary London,
commercial London, and, finally, maritime London, till we came
to a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls, where the
tenement houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of Europe.
Here, in a broad thoroughfare, once the abode of wealthy City
merchants, we found the sculpture works for which we searched.
Outside was a considerable yard full of monumental masonry.
Inside was a large room in which fifty workers were carving or
moulding. The manager, a big blond German, received us civilly
and gave a clear answer to all Holmes's questions. A reference
to his books showed that hundreds of casts had been taken from
a marble copy of Devine's head of Napoleon, but that the three
which had been sent to Morse Hudson a year or so before had
been half of a batch of six, the other three being sent to Harding
Brothers, of Kensington. There was no reason why those six
should be different from any of the other casts. He could suggest
no possible cause why anyone should wish to destroy them -- in
fact, he laughed at the idea. Their wholesale price was six
shillings, but the retailer would get twelve or more. The cast
was taken in two moulds from each side of the face, and then
these two profiles of plaster of Paris were joined together to
make the complete bust. The work was usually done by Italians,
in the room we were in. When finished, the busts were put on a
table in the passage to dry, and afterwards stored. That was all
he could tell us.
  But the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect
upon the manager. His face flushed with anger, and his brows
knotted over his blue Teutonic eyes.
  "Ah, the rascal!" he cried. "Yes, indeed, I know him very
well. This has always been a respectable establishment, and the
only time that we have ever had the police in it was over this
very fellow. It was more than a year ago now. He knifed another
Italian in the street, and then he came to the works with the
police on his heels, and he was taken here. Beppo was his
name -- his second name I never knew. Serve me right for engag-
ing a man with such a face. But he was a good workman -- one
of the best."
  "What did he get?"
  "The man lived and he got off with a year. I have no doubt he
is out now, but he has not dared to show his nose here. We have
a cousin of his here, and I daresay he could tell you where he
is."
  "No, no," cried Holmes, "not a word to the cousin -- not a
word, I beg of you. The matter is very important, and the farther
I go with it, the more important it seems to grow. When you
referred in your ledger to the sale of those casts I observed that
the date was June 3rd of last year. Could you give me the date
when Beppo was arrested?"
  "I could tell you roughly by the pay-list," the manager an-
swered. "Yes," he continued, after some turning over of pages,
"he was paid last on May 20th."
  "Thank you," said Holmes. "I don't think that I need intrude
upon your time and patience any more." With a last word of
caution that he should say nothing as to our researches, we
turned our faces westward once more.
  The afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch
a hasty luncheon at a restaurant. A news-bill at the entrance
announced "Kensington Outrage. Murder by a Madman," and
the contents of the paper showed that Mr. Horace Harker had got
his account into print after all. Two columns were occupied with
a highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident.
Holmes propped it against the cruet-stand and read it while he
ate. Once or twice he chuckled.
  "This is all right, Watson," said he. "Listen to this:

      "It is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference
    of opinion upon this case, since Mr. Lestrade, one of the
    most experienced members of the official force, and Mr.
    Sherlock Holmes, the well-known consulting expert, have
    each come to the conclusion that the grotesque series of
    incidents, which have ended in so tragic a fashion, arise
    from lunacy rather than from deliberate crime. No explana-
    tion save mental aberration can cover the facts.

The Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution. if you only
know how to use it. And now, if you have quite finished, we
will hark back to Kensington and see what the manager of
Harding Brothers has to say on the matter."
  The founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp
little person, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a
ready tongue.
  "Yes, sir, I have already read the account in the evening
papers. Mr. Horace Harker is a customer of ours. We supplied
him with the bust some months ago. We ordered three busts of
that sort from Gelder & Co., of Stepney. They are all sold now.
To whom? Oh, I daresay by consulting our sales book we could
very easily tell you. Yes, we have the entries here. One to Mr.
Harker you see, and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of Laburnum
Lodge, Laburnum Vale, Chiswick, and one to Mr. Sandeford, of
Lower Grove Road, Reading. No, I have never seen this face
which you show me in the photograph. You would hardly forget
it, would you, sir, for I've seldom seen an uglier. Have we any
Italians on the staff? Yes, sir, we have several among our
workpeople and cleaners. I daresay they might get a peep at that
sales book if they wanted to. There is no particular reason for
keeping a watch upon that book. Well, well, it's a very strange
business, and I hope that you will let me know if anything comes
of your inquiries."
  Holmes had taken several notes during Mr. Harding's evi-
dence, and I could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the
turn which affairs were taking. He made no remark, however
save that, unless we hurried, we should be late for our appoint-
ment with Lestrade. Sure enough, when we reached Baker Street
the detective was already there, and we found him pacing up and
down in a fever of impatience. His look of importance showed
that his day's work had not been in vain.
  "Well?" he asked. "What luck, Mr. Holmes?"
  "We have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted
one," my friend explained. "We have seen both the retailers and
also the wholesale manufacturers. I can trace each of the busts
now from the beginning."
  "The busts!" cried Lestrade. "Well, well, you have your own
methods, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and it is not for me to say a
word against them, but I think I have done a better day's work
than you. I have identified the dead man."
  "You don't say so?"
  "And found a cause for the crime."
  "Splendid!"
  "We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill
and the Italian quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic
emblem round his neck. and that, along with his colour, made
me think he was from the South. Inspector Hill knew him the
moment he caught sight of him. His name is Pietro Venucci,
from Naples, and he is one of the greatest cut-throats in Lon-
don. He is connected with the Mafia, which, as you know, is a
secret political society, enforcing its decrees by murder. Now,
you see how the affair begins to clear up. The other fellow is
probably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia. He has
broken the rules in some fashion. Pietro is set upon his track.
Probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man him-
self, so that he may not knife the wrong person. He dogs the
fellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits outside for him, and
in the scuffle he receives his own death-wound. How is that, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes?"
  Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.
  "Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!" he cried. "But I didn't quite
follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts."
  "The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head.
After all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It
is the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you that I
am gathering all the threads into my hands."
  "And the next stage?"
  "Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian
Quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest
him on the charge of murder. Will you come with us?"
  "I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I
can't say for certain, because it all depends -- well, it all depends
upon a factor which is completely outside our control. But I have
great hopes -- in fact, the betting is exactly two to one -- that if
you will come with us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay
him by the heels."
  "In the Italian Quarter?"
  "No, I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to
find him. If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night,
Lestrade, I'll promise to go to the Italian Quarter with you
to-morrow, and no harm will be done by the delay. And now I
think that a few hours' sleep would do us all good, for I do not
propose to leave before eleven o'clock, and it is unlikely that we
shall be back before morning. You'll dine with us, Lestrade, and
then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In
the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an
express messenger, for I have a letter to send and it is imponant
that it should go at once."
  Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the
old daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed.
When at last he descended, it was with triumph in his eyes, but
he said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches.
For my own part, I had followed step by step the methods by
which he had traced the various windings of this complex case,
and, though I could not yet perceive the goal which we would
reach, I understood clearly that Holmes expected this grotesque
criminal to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts, one
of which, I remembered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object
of our journey was to catch him in the very act, and I could not
but admire the cunning with which my friend had inserted a
wrong clue in the evening paper, so as to give the fellow the idea
that he could continue his scheme with impunity. I was not
surprised when Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver
with me. He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop,
which was his favourite weapon.
  A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove
to a spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the
cabman was directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a
secluded road fringed with pleasant houses, each standing in its
own grounds. In the light of a street lamp we read "Laburnum
Villa" upon the gate-post of one of them. The occupants had
evidently retired to rest, for all was dark save for a fanlight over
the hall door, which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden
path. The wooden fence which separated the grounds from the
road threw a dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it
was that we crouched.
  "I fear that you'll have a long wait," Holmes whispered.
"We may thank our stars that it is not raining. I don't think we
can even venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it's a two
to one chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble."
  It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as
Holmes had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and
singular fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn us
of his coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark
figure, as swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path.
We saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and
disappear against the black shadow of the house. There was a
long pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very
gentle creaking sound came to our ears. The window was being
opened. The noise ceased, and again there was a long silence.
The fellow was making his way into the house. We saw the
sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room. What he sought
was evidently not there, for again we saw the flash through
another blind. and then through another.
  "Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he
climbs out." Lestrade whispered.
  But before we could move. the man had emerged again. As he
came out into the glimmering patch of light, we saw that he
carrled something white under his arm. He looked stealthily all
round him. The silence of the deserted street reassured him.
Turning his back upon us he laid down his burden, and the next
instant there was the sound of a sharp tap, followed by a clatter
and rattle. The man was so intent upon what he was doing that
he never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot. With
the bound of a tiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later
Lestrade and I had him by either wrist, and the handcuffs had
been fastened. As we turned him over I saw a hideous, sallow
face, with writhing, furious features. glaring up at us, and I
knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had
secured.
  But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his
attention. Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most
carefully examining that which the man had brought from the
house. It was a bust of Napoleon. Iike the one which we had
seen that morning, and it had been broken into similar frag-
ments. Carefully Holmes held each separate shard to the light,
but in no way did it differ from any other shattered piece of
plaster. He had just completed his examination when the hall
lights flew up, the door opened, and the owner of the house, a
jovial, rotund figure in shirt and trousers, presented himseli.
  "Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?" said Holmes.     
  "Yes, sir and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had
the note which you sent by the express messenger, and I did
exactly what you told me. We locked every door on the inside
and awaited developments. Well, I'm very glad to see that you
have got the rascal. I hope, gentlemen, that you will come in and
have some refreshment."
  However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe
quarters, so within a few minutes our cab had bcen summoned
and we were all tour upon our way to London. Not a word
would our captive say. but he glared at us from thc shadow of
his matted hair. and once. when my hand seemed within his
reach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. We stayed long
enough at the police-station to learn that a search of his clothing
revealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath knife, the
handle of which bore copious traces of recent blood.
  "That's all right," said Lestrade, as we parted. "Hill knows
all these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You'll find that
my theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I'm sure I am
exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike
way in which you laid hands upon him. I don't quite understand
it all yet."
  "I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations," said
Holmes. "Besides, there are one or two details which are not
finished off, and it is one of those cases which are worth
working out to the very end. If you will come round once more
to my rooms at six o'clock to-morrow, I think I shall be able to
show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning
of this business, which presents some features which make it
absolutely original in the history of crime. If ever I permit you to
chronicle any more of my little problems, Watson, I foresee that
you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular
adventure of the Napoleonic busts."
  When we met again next evening, Lestrade was furnished with
much information concerning our prisoner. His name, it ap-
peared, was Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-
known ne'er-do-well among the Italian colony. He had once
been a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest living, but he
had taken to evil courses and had twice already been in jail --
once for a petty theft, and once, as we had already heard, for
stabbing a fellow-countryman. He could talk English perfectly
well. His reasons for destroying the busts were still unknown,
and he refused to answer any questions upon the subject, but the
police had discovered that these same busts might very well have
been made by his own hands, since he was engaged in this class
of work at the establishment of Gelder & Co. To all this infor-
mation, much of which we already knew, Holmes listened with
polite attention, but I, who knew him so well, could clearly see
that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a mixture of
mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he
was wont to assume. At last he started in his chair, and his eyes
brightened. There had been a ring at the bell. A minute later we
heard steps upon the stairs, and an elderly red-faced man with
grizzled side-whiskers was ushered in. In his right hand he
carried an old-fashioned carpet-bag, which he placed upon the
table.
  "Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?"
  My friend bowed and smiled. "Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I
suppose?" said he.
  "Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late, but the trains
were awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my
possession."
  "Exactly."
  "I have your letter here. You said, 'I desire to possess a copy
of Devine's Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds
for the one which is in your possession.' Is that right?"
  "Certainly."
  "I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not
imagine how you knew that I owned such a thing."
  "Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation
is very simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they
had sold you their last copy, and he gave me your address."
  "Oh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I paid for it?"
  "No, he did not."
  "Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only
gave fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to know
that before I take ten pounds from you."
  "I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I
have named that price, so I intend to stick to it."
  "Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought
the bust up with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!" He
opened his bag, and at last we saw placed upon our table a
complete specimen of that bust which we had already seen more
than once in fragments.
  Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound
note upon the table.
  "You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the
presence of these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer
every possible right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a
methodical man, you see, and you never know what turn events
might take afterwards. Thank you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your
money, and I wish you a very good evening."
  When our visitor had disappeared, Sherlock Holmes's move-
ments were such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a
clean white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table.
Then he placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth.
Finally, he picked up his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a
sharp blow on the top of the head. The figure broke into frag-
ments, and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains. Next
instant, with a loud shout of triumph he held up one splinter, in
which a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in a pudding.
  "Gentlemen," he cried, "let me introduce you to the famous
black pearl of the Borgias."
  Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a
spontaneous impulse, we both broke out clapping, as at the
well-wrought crisis of a play. A flush of colour sprang to Holmes's
pale cheeks, and he bowed to us like the master dramatist who
receives the homage of his audience. It was at such moments that
for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine, and betrayed
his human love for admiration and applause. The same singularly
proud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain from
popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depths by
spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.
  "Yes, gentlemen," said he, "it is the most famous pearl now
existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a
connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the
Prince of Colonna's bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was
lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon
which were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You
will remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the disappear-
ance of this valuable jewel, and the vain efforts of the London
police to recover it. I was myself consulted upon the case, but I
was unable to throw any light upon it. Suspicion fell upon the
maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and it was proved that
she had a brother in London, but we failed to trace any connec-
tion between them. The maid's name was Lucretia Venucci, and
there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who was murdered
two nights ago was the brother. I have been looking up the dates
in the old files of the paper, and I find that the disappearance of
the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of Beppo, for
some crime of violence -- an event which took place in the
factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts
were being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events,
though you see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way
in which they presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl
in his possession. He may have stolen it from Pietro, he may
have been Pietro's confederate, he may have been the go-between
of Pietro and his sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the
correct solution.
  "The main fact is that he had the pearl, and at that moment,
when it was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He
made for the factory in which he worked, and he knew that he
had only a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously
valuable prize, which would otherwise be found on him when he
was searched. Six plaster casts of Napoleon were drying in the
passage. One of them was still soft. In an instant Beppo, a
skilful workman, made a small hole in the wet plaster, dropped
in the pearl, and with a few touches covered over the aperture
once more. It was an admirable hiding-place. No one could
possibly find it. But Beppo was condemned to a year's imprison-
ment, and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over
London. He could not tell which contained his treasure. Only by
breaking them could he see. Even shaking would tell him noth-
ing, for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl
would adhere to it -- as, in fact, it has done. Beppo did not
despair, and he conducted his search with considerable ingenuity
and perseverance. Through a cousin who works with Gelder, he
found out the retail firms who had bought the busts. He managed
to find employment with Morse Hudson, and in that way tracked
down three of them. The pearl was not there. Then, with the
help of some Italian employe, he succeeded in finding out where
the other three busts had gone. The first was at Harker's. There
he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible
for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which
followed."
  "If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photo-
graph?" I asked.
  "As a means of tracing him, if he wished to inquire about him
from any third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after
the murder I calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather
than delay his movements. He would fear that the police would
read his secret, and so he hastened on before they should get
ahead of him. Of course, I could not say that he had not found
the pearl in Harker's bust. I had not even concluded for certain
that it was the pearl, but it was evident to me that he was looking
for something, since he carried the bust past the other houses in
order to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlooking it.
Since Harker's bust was one in three, the chances were exactly
as I told you -- two to one against the pearl being inside it There
remained two busts, and it was obvious that he would go for the
London one first. I warned the inmates of the house, so as to
avoid a second tragedy, and we went down, with the happiest
results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain that it was the
Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the murdered man
linked the one event with the other. There only remained a single
bust -- the Reading one -- and the pearl must be there. I bought it
in your presence from the owner -- and there it lies."
  We sat in silence for a moment.
  "Well," said Lestrade, "I've seen you handle a good many
cases, Mr. Holmes, but I don't know that I ever knew a more
workmanlike one than that. We're not jealous of you at Scotland
Yard. No, sir, we are very proud of you, and if you come down
to-morrow, there's not a man, from the oldest inspector to the
youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad to shake you by the
hand."
  "Thank you!" said Holmes. "Thank you!" and as he turned
away, it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the
softer human emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later
he was the cold and practical thinker once more. "Put the pearl
in the safe, Watson," said he, "and get out the papers of the
Conk-Singleton forgery case. Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little
problem comes your way, I shall be happy, if I can, to give you
a hint or two as to its solution."

                             "BLASTERS TO THE READY!"

                               by William E. Collins

     The Gunny yelled "BLASTERS TO THE READY!"  I popped the ejection 
button, took my ammo cassette out, flipped it over and re-inserted.  At 
the same time I was slamming the loading door closed, I brought my 
blaster to my right shoulder, cross arm saluted and returned to the 
ready.
 
     Today was the day. While marching to battle I'd get my first chance to 
use my weapon for the good of mankind.  I'd been practicing for 
months just for this day.  It seemed as though my whole life was in 
preparation for today.  I wondered if I'd succeed or fail.
 
     Thoughts of Roman Legions, Christians and Lions, Foreign Legionnaires, 
of life, love and happiness filled my mind.  Would there be any at the end 
of the day? Would I be one of the ones to fall?
 
     Then it was my turn. I readied my blaster, turning it from stun to max...
I can see thousands of them out there. What will this outcome be? 
 
     I ready my blaster...
 
          place my finger on the button...
 
               then I press...  There is a roar so loud that my knees
                   quiver. I feel I want to wet my pants. The roar
                      is getting louder as I play my blaster over the
                          thousands of people in front of me...
 
                    With a squeal the final assault is coming...  the 
                       roar abates a bit and I can hear the immortal 
                          words...
 

            "JIMI HENDRIX!"

 
     With a squeal and a roar the blaster puts out the only known surviving
recording of Jimi Hendrix performing "The Star Spangled Banner."  I own 
it and, and, like my father before me, I will play it once a year at the 
World Series for others to hear.

                    THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE

   Once upon a time .... there was a hare who, boasting how he could run 
faster than anyone else, was forever teasing tortoise for its slowness. Then 
one day, the irate tortoise answered back: "Who do you think you are? There's 
no denying you're swift, but even you can be beaten!" The hare squealed with 
laughter.
   "Beaten in a race? By whom? Not you, surely! I bet there's nobody in the 
world that can win against me, I'm so speedy. Now, why don't you try?"
   Annoyed by such bragging, the tortoise accepted the challenge. A course was
planned, and next day at dawn they stood at the startiny line. The hare yawned
sleepily as the meek tortoise trudged slowly off. When the hare saw how 
painfully slow his rival was, he decided, half asleep on his feet, to have a 
quick nap. "Take your time!" he said. "I'll have forty winks and catch up with
you in a minute."
   The hare woke with a start from a fitful sleep and gazed round, looking for
the tortoise. But the creature was only a short distance away, having barely 
covered a third of the course. Breathing a sigh of relief, the hare decided he
might as well have breakfast too, and off he went to munch some cabbages he 
had noticed in a nearby field. But the heavy meal and the hot sun made his 
eyelids droop. With a careless glance at the tortoise, now halfway along the 
course, he decided to have another snooze before flashing past the winning 
post. And smiling at the thought of the look on the tortoise's face when it 
saw the hare speed by, he fell fast asleep and was soon snoring happily. The 
sun started to sink, below the horizon, and the tortoise, who had been 
plodding towards the winning post since morning, was scarcely a yard from the 
finish. At that very point, the hare woke with a jolt. He could see the 
tortoise a speck in the distance and away he dashed. He leapt and bounded at a
great rate, his tongue lolling, and gasping for breath. Just a little more and
he'd be first at the finish. But the hare's last leap was just too late, for
the tortoise had beaten him to the winning post. Poor hare! Tired and in 
disgrace, he slumped down beside the tortoise who was silently smiling at him.
   "Slowly does it every time!" he said.

Background for Cool Darkness

	Sinclair was one of the first people to develop electromagnetic 
devices and weapons.  He created the first series of needlers and gaussian 
weaponry and has been creating state-of-the-art weaponry ever since.  
The Sinclair K2 is a single hand-held needler that is not-so common 
among well armed groups or people of the lower class.  It uses longer 
needles than the K1, a single-hand needler that uses 3" needles, 80 per 
four inch mag.  These needles are 5" long with a 5" mag holding 50.  It's 
wider than a K1 and is used primarily for penetration and power against 
armored individuals.  Most K2's are semiauto while the K1 has on-the-fly 
switching from semi to full auto capabilities.  Cerated, armor piercing 
and explosive needles are available into the military, security and black 
markets.

	Polymetals are alloys of metals that have polymer composites 
fabricated into the material at the time of final molding.  This allows for 
improved chemical and physical properties of the material while 
improving its strength and the ability to keep a sharp edge.  It also aids 
in reinforcing materials such as strengthening armor plating and 
bullet-proof jackets.

	The story takes place somewhere around 2030 in a fast growing 
suburb of Philadelphia.

			Chapter 1 : Mark of the Huntress	

	"Awe, shit.  Man this is too much for one night" Dave sighed.
Five hours on the net after a full day's work at the office was enough
for a 24 hour day.  He slouched back into his recliner and turned on the 
built in massage, pulled the plugs from his system and blankly stared at 
the ceiling.
	"Too bad you still got a few hours before it's over."  He loosened
his tie and unbuttoned the top button of his white shirt.  A midnight
snack should be good he thought to himself.  He sleepily stood up 
between rolls of computer paper and electronic cables snaking through 
the small den of his apartment in Philly.  'Thank god the lights are off or 
I'd really have a headache.'  Dave walked out of the room, still thinking 
over the latest ideas from work involving the net connections between 
North America and Europe.  'Goddamn bureaucrats think they know 
everything.  Hell, they probably couldn't even tell if I changed their 
comm links from DC to LA.'  The walk to the refrigerator was short.  The 
light from inside blinded him shortly since it was the only light on in 
the house.  'I wonder what Cryon is up to tonight.  They haven't been 
going out as much lately as they used to.'  A thought that sounded like 
something was getting ready to go down, but with no background.  They 
haven't done anything lately that would hint to it.  He didn't like that.
	He pulled an open jar of pickles out of the frig and a container of 
mustard, opened the bread drawer and got a loaf of old bread that was on
the brink of molding.  Some meat and a bag of chips followed.  He sat 
down at the small round table next the to kitchen entrance and began 
making a sandwich.  He took a bite.  'Damn thing is getting stale.  I 
wonder how Nick is doing?  The last time I talked with him must've been 
2 weeks ago.'  He swiveled around in his chair to a wall panel and entered 
the code for  a direct telecom interconnect.
	The video jumped up and Nick's tired face showed up on the 
screen.
	"Nick, how you doin' man?" squawked Dave getting ready to take 
another bite out of his sandwich.
	"Dave...Do you know what time it is?"
	"Yeah, but I couldn't sleep.  What's up.  I haven't.."
	Blink.  Blink.  A monitor light went on.  Someone's at the door, 
thought Dave.  'Who the hell would come at a time like this?'
	"Hang on, someone's at the door."
	"At this time of night?"  It was too late.  Dave was already up and 
heading for the door.  Opening up another panel, the lights went on and 
Dave spoke through the intercom mic.
	"Who's there?"
	The monitor light blinked again.
	"I said who's there!?"  'No answer.  No answer.'  Something's up.  
He began walking away from the door.  
	"Get out Nick.  Somethin's up!"  yelled Dave from across the room.
	"What's going on over there Dave!?"
	THUD..THUD.  CRACK!  Dave's door popped partly open as the 
bottom hinge cracked out of the door frame.  THUD..THUD..SMASH!  The 
top hinge nearly exploded open with force as the door toppled to one 
side, rendering the computer and physical locking mechanisms 
completely ineffective.  Dave scurried backward as a large man slowly 
walked into the apartment, stepping on the discarded door.  Dark short 
hair and a dark skinned face sat on top of a set of shoulders and a huge 
frame as he pulled something out of his dark, tattered overcoat.  Dave 
turned to run towards his den when a silent shot was fired into his left 
leg.  
	"Aaauuuuu!" screamed Dave as he fell into the table where he had 
just begun his midnight snack.  The telecom monitor flicked off as Dave 
moved to face his attacker.  He side slouched into his chair, holding his 
leg.  A needle stuck out of it by about an inch, leaving a small circular 
blood stain forming on his dress pants.
	The man walked up to Dave shooting another two silent shots into 
his leg, making him scream in pain.  A large hand wrapped itself around 
Dave's throat and began picking him up.  His face reddened and his eyes 
began to bulge as he was suspended in mid air by his attacker's 
suffocating grip.  His grip was hard, almost too hard as Dave reached up 
with both hands to grasp it.
	"Who the hell are you!" Dave spit out having more difficulty 
breathing.  The light from the room was in his eyes so he couldn't see his 
enemy's face.  He didn't remember running into him before, he was sure 
of that.  A shot was fired at the control panel on the wall, but not by his 
attacker who had put his gun down on the dining table.  Another shot 
and the panel exploded in an array of sparks and flames.  A final shot 
was fired at the lights which exploded out, darkening the apartment 
once more.  Dave flinched from the spraying glass.  He was lifted a little 
higher as his assailant's other fist flew into Dave's lower ribs, making a 
noticeable cracking sound as it shattered a few, knocking the wind out of 
Dave.  He was then turned around and thrown into the opposite wall of 
his den a few feet away.  His attacker turned around to pick up his gun, 
which gave Dave a little time to move out of the way by crawling into his 
den amongst the electronics and wires.  Two more shots were fired 
directly into his leg as he was almost fully in, leaving him immobile 
from the pain with only the sounds of heavy footsteps echoing toward 
the den's entrance.
	The split, mangy tails of a cheap grayish-black overcoat dangled 
at the ankles of Dave's pursuer.  Combat boots and a dark cat burglar's 
baggy suit shown underneath the opened coat, as a Sinclair K2 was being 
placed back in it's shoulder harness, then covered by the thick fiber-
metal mesh coat.  He couldn't see a face or even a head from his 
encumbered position on the carpeted floor.  Dave just stared at his large 
enemy, unable to move from the pain in his cracked ribs, and the 5 inch 
needles sticking out of his left leg.  The only taste from his interrupted 
midnight snack away from the net was of blood.
	"Next time, don't fuck with Nestroth, Dave" came a quiet but stern 
female voice from the doorway; the type that could be sweet if it didn't 
send a shiver down your spine, but would scare the hell out of you if 
caught in a dark alley on Halloween.  
	Dave tried looking past his pursuer.  He knew that voice, he knew 
it from somewhere.  Nestroth gave him a hint, but there was no match.  
Not with that female voice.  It just sounded so familiar, but then again it 
didn't.  He just couldn't place it.  He had run into Nestroth a few times 
trying to break a few systems, but he'd never tangled with them, at least 
not to his knowledge.  Every time he had run into them, they either 
kicked him out or he got out himself.  He knew Nestroth was not one to be 
messed with, anywhere.  Anyone who did normally either was found 
dead or never found.  That didn't help Dave's thinking as he stared at his 
victor with only the thought of death running around in his head.  'If 
only I could think of what got me into this in the first place' Dave 
thought to himself, hoping for a chance to get out of it one way or the 
other.
	A hand slapped against the left shoulder of the overcoat.  Slowly 
and with enough coolness to chill ice, he moved to one side of the 
doorway without losing sight of his prey.  Blue and red streaks of light 
shined in from the neon streetlights through the opposing windows, 
leaving less to be hidden in the not-so-well kept apartment.  A few 
computer screens flickered and with the outside light, showed the 
mounds of electronics and scrap papers lying all over the small room.  
An athletically slender female figure covered only with a skintight body 
suit and a pair of stainless steel spiked heels, entered the room with the 
finesse and grace of a cat, and noticeably the cunning of one as well.  
Her slender body left little to the imagination as she snaked towards 
Dave.  Shiny metallic nail polish glistened on her fingertips in the 
sporadic changing lights.  Her footsteps made no noise as her spiked 
heels sank into the thick carpet and almost pierced through the material 
underneath.  Her bodysuit was mostly black with the exception of a dark 
red artistic line running across the main body of it, creating fading 
curls of color along an arm and the opposite leg.  Her hair matched the 
entire outfit; dark and slightly long, but not touching her shoulders.
	"Stand up shithead" she hissed walking to within inches of his 
pale face.
	"I..I...I can't.  My leg.." he whimpered.
	"Just do it or I'll have Nemesis stand you up whether you like it or 
not!"
	Remembering his encounter a few moments ago with 'Nemesis', 
he painfully began to bring himself up to a hunched over position, still 
holding his leg in pain.  He looked near her fearing the consequences of 
eye contact.  Blood trickled from his left leg and stained his business 
pants as he favored the other leg; the polymetal needles still sticking out 
of his leg.
	"Last night will be the last time you go after Cryon, Dave.  Do we 
understand each other?"
	"I didn't go against Cryon last night, honest I didn't" he sputtered 
back.  Sweat beads were forming on his head as her hot breath touched 
his face, while she pushed her face within an inch of his.
	"Don't bullshit me Dave.  Nestroth ran into you last night while 
going against Cryon and you fucked us up!  Don't make me..".
	"I haven't run into Nestroth in weeks and that was only an 
accident, really.  I don't want any trouble with Nestroth.  Come on, 
they're too big for me" he shakingly replied.  "Hell, I don't even know 
you guys.  That's how long it's been since I....".
	Backing away from his face, she retracted a set of 4 inch claws 
that lay at her waistside which had gone unnoticed until now.  Her 
eyebrows still in a devilish frown.  Her breathing still calm.  Her lips 
tight with fury, contrary to Dave's sweating, pale face.  A dark red stain 
was forming on his white shirt where Nemesis had punched him earlier.
	Raising her hand, "You may call me Slash" was her only reply as 
her claws extended to a solid 7 inches, and left his head lying next to his 
crumpled body as the blue light shined off the blood dripping from her 
otherwise spotless weapon of choice.  The only sound was a distant 
humming from the changing neon lights, and a grinning Nemesis.

		Chapter 2 : Welcome to the Jungle

	"Enter Password" spit the computer controlled lock of a small 
warehouse on the other side of town; the dirty side of town.  Trash lay all 
around the alleyway and the light blowing smog that seems to inhabit 
the entire city rolled by, bring papers and dust with it.  Slash entered the 
neural code embedded into Nestroth's security ROM chip, implanted into 
her skull, and took her security card back as the graffitied, grayish 
metal alley door unlocked.  She walking in just as smoothly as she had 
done entering Dave's apartment, with Nemesis behind her shutting the 
door with the echoing thud of a vault.

	The semi-lit corridor weaved to the right a little bit.  The corridor 
was surrounded by old wooden crates piled on metal warehouse frames 
slightly beginning to rust from the humidity of the city air.  A metal 
catwalk lingered just above Nemesis' head as they walked into the open 
meeting room of Nestroth.  This was one of there meeting places.  One 
that was used after the fact.  The whole warehouse was only 50 by 50 feet, 
but it was perfect for their purposes:  small enough to be unnoticed; 
large enough to be useful.  There was a bar on the opposing wall from 
the entrance.  A pool table, a few TV's, a bar and a stereo made up the 
majority of the hall while the computer links and weapon banks were 
closest to the left wall.  Everything a person could want after a job, while 
still maintaining some security to the place.  A glance around from Slash 
produced a few scanners locked on them, verifying who's who.  A guard 
armed appropriately watched from the right catwalk that continued 
around the entire warehouse.  Dressed in normal street clothes, he raised 
his gloved right hand as a sign of hello to Slash.  She slightly nodded 
hello and continued looking around.

	A few desks were scattered around the room with paperwork, 
blueprints and other 'necessities' on top or laid out on built in desk 
monitors.  A medium sized man with an open white jacket, yellow shirt 
and nice slacks looked to be jacked in at one of the desks in a lounge 
chair.  The only thing was there was no cable.  A metal band with 
blinking LEDs wrapped around the back of his head connecting his two 
ports, but weren't connected to anything else.  His eyes blinked and he 
raised his head from his propped up arms to notice the two.  A few lights 
flashed on and off on his headgear and he raised his right arm to the 
back of it.  A few seconds later, the two sides of the device connected to 
his ports popped off and he placed the gear down onto the table.  A small 
stretch and a wipe of the eyes and he stood up reaching for the beer in 
front of him.

	Slash walked towards him as she noticed out of the corner of her 
eye, Nemesis going to a sofa on the far side of the room to throw his 
jacket down.  

	"So what did you bring me?" he asked, not changing his blank 
expression.

	"Merry Christmas , Nebulus" Slash retorted in a painfully sly tone 
of voice and a slight grin as she pulled Dave's head out of the black bag 
she was holding.

	"Not bad.  What else did you bring me?" Nebulus asked raising an 
eyebrow, taking another drink without removing his eyes from her.

	"The last time he said he ran into us was a few weeks ago" she said 
dropping his head into the disposal system next to the desk without a 
thought or a look.  "He denied going after Cryon last night.  He died with 
his story in tact so either he was one devoted liar, or he was too scared to 
make up a fake story.  In any case, we've got copies of his records for the
past two months including his work on the international nets and his
individual activities around the sites."

	Nemesis had put his coat down and returned to the discussion.  
Standing about half a foot over Nebulus, his body was highlighted from 
the lighting array suspended from the ceiling by chains.  His skin was 
very dark brown with tints of gray that seemed even darker behind 
Nebulus' white jacket.  His black tank top showed off his large muscles 
that had obviously been enhanced through drugs.  His black hair was cut 
in a spiked military fashion and he still wore his shades, even though 
the lighting inside wasn't that illuminating.

	"Or else he was there and tried to make us believe he wasn't.  You 
should've pulled more info out of him before you killed him.  Now we 
don't know what's going on" retorted Nebulus.  He slouched back into his 
padded chair and enabled the foot rest.  He closed his eyes, running his 
hand through his military style blond hair only to let out of a frustrated 
sigh that was meant to be heard.  He leaned back with his eyes closed as 
the other two members of the group who had been at the bar the whole 
time, came up to the table.

	"Hey kids, how's it goin'?  Did you and Davey-boy have fun 
tonight or what."  It was Zlik.  Slash hated his humor, especially when it 
wasn't in taste.  He walked closer to her side egging her on with his 
cock-eyed smirking that drove her nuts.  "Come on, tell old Zlik what 
happened baby."

	"Knock it off Zlik.  Why don't you take you and your filthy street 
'garb' somewhere where I can't smell it." darted Slash, eyeing him with 
one of those 'Don't push me looks'.  "We got enough problems without 
your nonsense."  Zlik was from the streets and probably will always be 
there as well.  He grew up there, hangs there now, and will forever have 
a name with those who have long purple hair that hangs to one side.

	"Goddamn skinny son of a .." murmured Slash.

	"Cool it children" snapped Nebulus, opening his eyes and 
furrowing his brow again.  "Jack, what do we have on the nets for the 
past few hours from Dave's area?"

	"Nothing to my knowledge.  The whole sector's been quiet since 
he got off" replied Jack in a gentlemen's voice, standing next to Nemesis.  
Actually, he stood underneath Nemesis.  He was very short and stocky, in 
fact he was getting on the fat side.  That's the problem with netrunning 
all day and all night.  Jack was the type of individual who got so hooked 
into the system that if he had his choice, he would never get out.  Unless 
of course he had to.  But that was never.  That's how he got his name, 
Jack.  Constantly jacking in and out of the nets, only to get back in as 
soon as possible.  He gambles with everything he gets into and most of 
the time, if and when rarely caught, he barely makes it out without 
being traced or ICEd.  But that's how he wanted to run his life:  on the 
edge, at least from the perception of the net.

	"Get me updated on Cryon ASAP, Jack, and make sure they're not 
screwing around with our side of the board!" demanded Nebulus.

	"Sure thing boss" replied Jack, still in his business shirt, business 
appearance, and business attitude.  Hey slowly walked away from the 
group and reached another desk a little distance away from the informal 
meeting.  He picked up the same headgear as Nebulus had and put it on, 
eventually peering off into space, or cyberspace as the case may be.

	"What the hell is that thing he's got on his head?" questioned 
Slash, a little perturbed that she hadn't been updated on the new tech 
yet.

	"It's an experimental wireless connect between your ports and a 
jack in site.  But like I said, it's only experimental, so it doesn't leave this 
room" explained Nebulus, calming down slightly.  "We stole the idea and 
some of the design from Cryon.  The rest came from industry with the 
holes filled in by Jack and his tech buddies at Nortech."

	"He's still working there?" asked Zlik, wising up a bit.  The party 
began to disperse, each individual going there own way.  "Awe screw it 
man" snobbed Zlik heading for the corridor leading to the alleyway.  The 
metal door slammed shut once he was out and the room was dead quiet 
with the exception of the echoing metallic slam of the door.  Everyone 
that wasn't jacked in was still looking at the corridor that Zlik just 
walked through.

	"When the hell is he going to get a life and stop being a street 
bum!?" complained Slash.

	"He's one of the best street informants I've ever known, Slash.  
Just get off his back" grumbled a low, direct voice.

	She turned around, looking at Nemesis who never had a lot to say.  
"Is that so.  Then why does he always dress like he's still on the streets?"

	"Because he is."  With that Nemesis grabbed his coat from the sofa 
and proceeded to follow Zlik's exit, never loosing sight of Slash.

***************

	"Don't let her get to you man, she's just bein' a bitch tonight 
cause we didn't get what we wanted from Dave" said Nemesis after 
catching up to Zlik.  His shades were still on even though it was 
approaching two in the morning.  The two of them walked for a while 
and finally made it to the noisy part of town.  The bars and joints 
stretched for a few blocks and never shut down as long as it was dark 
outside.  This was the night spot; where everyone came who was anyone, 
at four in the morning that is.

	"So what happened with the job with Dave?" asked Zlik.

	"We took him out well, but Nebulus wasn't impressed with the info 
we got from him.  I think Nebulus thinks someone's out for us.  Hell, it 
wouldn't surprise me, that's for sure."

	"At least it would make life interesting for once."

	"True."  They walked side by side down the sidewalk towards there 
favorite spot - Black Oil.  The only place on the strip that was almost 
pitch black dark inside and that served the hardest drinks, only.  It was a 
nice place.  The bar was always packed and the back rooms always full.  
It was mostly inhabited by deckers, samurai, informants or people just 
there for business.  Frankly, the bar wasn't even built to be a bar, but 
that never surfaced in conversation.

	Zlik was almost as tall as Nemesis, but a hell of a lot skinnier.  His 
tattered street clothes, long purple hair and terrible street accent set 
him apart from his companion.  A little harassment from the local girls 
and a few psychos that were missing more than a couple of brain cells 
made the trip seem normal.  The streets were cluttered with garbage and 
debris from the riots a few days ago.  Most of the street lights were out or 
on there way to go out.  Most of the cars on the streets had a few bumps 
or bruises, many having broken windows or shattered lights.  The alleys 
were filled with drunken street people sitting in the wall crevices and 
dealers making their nightly pay.  It might be the summer, but for some 
reason the night was a little cooler than normal.

	Before long, the Black Oil neon sign was a few doors down.  A 
small crowd had formed out front of the closed doors of the place with 
people just hangin' out.  A little pushing and shoving and the two got 
past the crowd of people who wanted to look cool by the bar, but didn't 
want to go in.

	Past the doors, the bar was dark as night.  Smoke filled the air and 
seemed to hover like a cloud just above people's heads.  There was just 
about enough room to walk around the place without hugging each 
other in the process.  A pool table could be spotted across the room in the 
far right corner from the foyer landing where Nemesis and Zlik stood 
side by side, each looking around for someone or something.  Most of the 
people here were dressed to kill.  The styles ranged from very slick to 
very sleazy, but all with the intent to intimidate.  The bar was centered 
in the middle of the place, raised a step above the floor to make it a little 
more formidable for stools.  It was nice, though, compared to the others 
in town.  All the walls were old fashioned wood with paintings and 
electronic art scattered around.  At least there was no graffiti on the 
inside of the joint.  Looking around produced a second floor of mostly 
wooden tables surrounding the outside walls of the place.  Round 
hanging pool lights hung from the ceiling with most of the lights either 
broken or turned off.

	Zlik started down the half flight of stairs without noting Nemesis' 
intentions for the evening.  But that was his style.  He grew up on this 
side of town, was one of the first to come to the bar when it was first 
opened, and will probably be one of those who are killed in it as well.  
Nemesis watched him slowly push his way toward the far side of the bar 
and begin talking with a few friends that normally were found here 
after midnight.  Nemesis, on the other hand, slowly made his way to the 
opposite side to watch a game of pool before going to the bar for a drink.

	"So what's new on the streets" questioned the guy slowly 
drinking a Toxic Rum next to Zlik, his long bleached hair almost 
touching the tip of the glass during each sip.

	"Depends on what side of the tracks you're from."

	"The down side."

	"Cryon is on the move again and no one knows what's going on."

	"I thought they weren't screwing around on the nets yet?  Last I 
heard, they weren't going after any company takeovers or anything" he 
said with a concerned yet questionable tone of voice, still just looking at 
his shot.

	"Their RAD just jumped and their in the market.  Nestroth's 
chasin' the rabbit so make sure the field is clear" noted Zlik.  He hated 
discussing names in company, but that was life on the streets.  "How's 
you're girl friend?"

	"Which one?" he asked in disgust.

	"Charles."

	"Watch your back.  Deckers are out tonight and it's gonna be a 
while until sex is as good as it used to be."

	"Who's spreading the disease?"

	"Mogul's back."  Spotting an old girl friend across the room, Zlik 
got up from the bar and began his way towards her, noting his friend 
with only a tap on the bar before leaving.  Information and friends are 
two different things when it comes to who's chasing who.  Anyway, most 
of the 'friends' that you make in a place like this can't be trusted further 
than the shot they drink from.

	'Mogul is back' thought Zlik on his way across the bar.  'This is 
not good.  The last time they were back proved to be a challenge in more 
ways than just survival.  Mogul was one of those groups that just looked 
for conflicts with other groups.  Nestroth normally didn't mind 
competition when going after a company or something like that, but 
when a gang gets involved with business, business gets bloody.'

	"Hey sexy!  How's it goin'!?"  yelled Zlik.

	"Well if it isn't Zlik.  I haven't seen you here for a while.  Where 
the hell you been hiddin' out lately?" replied Shiela.

	"I've been around.  You sure look awful different since we went 
out last year.  So who you datin' now babe?"  Her black leather clad body 
and curly-long, dyed black hair contrasted to her old street image of 
baggy pants and oversized shirts.  Her face was even more pale now.  Her 
appearance almost was of the dead instead of who he remembered her to 
be.

	"Nobody special.  He's right here."  She turned around and pulled 
on the shoulder of a large man standing behind her talking with a small 
bunch of guys dressed in the same black leather attire.  He turned 
around to face Zlik.  "I told you he'd be here honey" she said looking 
directly into Zlik's eyes with a devil's grin only Glasya could wear.

	"So this is the mighty Zlik of Nestroth!" he said taking a step 
closer and shoving his glass into Shiela's hand.  "Don't tell me you've 
come back for seconds with her MATE!"  He might be a little drunk, but 
he was definitely pissing Zlik off with his attitude; one of the few things 
which Zlik didn't tolerate.

	"Where the fuck did you pick him up Shiela!?  Pirates Are Us or 
Assholes Anonymous!!!?" attacked Zlik with his irate attitude aimed 
directly at Shiela.

	"Good-bye Zlik" was her only monotone reply as her grin turned 
sour and she retreated towards the bar, walking behind her man.

	"Oh, fine, walk off with a nice good-bye babe!  Hey, don't forget 
your beer belly bozo here bitch!" yelled Zlik not moving from his 
position.  His attack was still muffled by the crowd around them.  No one 
paid any attention to quarrels like that, anymore.

	Giving a daring glare in her direction, his neck was violently 
grabbed by Shiela's lover.  

	"She picked me up at Mogul, you shitty piece of street slime.  How 
do you feel about that, Dick!?"  Zlik's eyebrow's raised instantly at the 
thought of what he was in now, just in time for a double sided dagger to 
be thrust into his stomach by his adversary.  His mouth dropped open 
and his eyes shut from the pain.  His body almost being totally supported 
by the hand still clenching his neck, making his breathing more 
difficult.  The knife twisted in his side and his brow furrowed more until 
all he could do is scream out in pain.  The crowd around him began to 
notice the action, but it was too late.  His back began to arch and his 
knees started bending slowly as the life drained out of his body, staining 
his shirt, and began to form a reflective puddle on the floor underneath 
him.

	"MOGULLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!" screamed Zlik, thrusting his right 
elbow outward.  An old fashioned quick release snubnose appeared in his 
palm and directed itself towards the chest of his killer.  Four shots were 
fired before his body crumpled to the bloody wooden floor, his right arm 
sticking straight upward with the gun still resting in his palm.  He was 
soon followed by his killer to the floor.  His leather armor lined jacket 
not enough against good old Teflon II coated ammunition, bringing him 
down nearly on top of Zlik.  Their blood staining each other's body.  The 
crowd going silent momentarily to see who was involved this night 
while the bartender called the cops, then resuming with the normal 
discussions of the evening.  Another night, another death.  Pretty 
normal for nighttime in Philly, or any major city for that matter.

	Shiela slowly made her way to the entrance and existed alone, 
mingling with a few others who didn't want to be around when the cops 
showed up to collect the bodies.  Nemesis, too far away to do anything but 
watch his friend die, and hear the gunshots at the last moment, kept and 
eye on her and followed her out of the establishment.  He'd met her a few 
times before, but never really got to know her.  He never really liked 
her in the first place.  Trusted would probably be a better word.  Now he 
knew why.  Mogul on the other hand meant something, something very 
serious.  Mogul was a gang that ran a last year and tried terrorizing 
certain underground groups.  Nestroth was one of the groups that 
brought them down.  Unfortunately, they didn't wipe them out 
completely.

	Shiela began down the strip and soon turned into a known 
alleyway.  Nemesis followed, cautiously surveying his position.  He 
started into the alley, but she was already gone.  Impossible.  The alley is 
too long and he was too close to lose her that fast.  He didn't like it.  He 
didn't like it one bit.  A few more meters in and he stopped, switching his 
cybernetic retina implants from night vision to thermal infra-red 
sensing.  He walked a few more meters with his jacket loosely buttoned.  
He finally stopped completely and looked around.  As he looked up he 
caught a glimpse of part of a person who must have been peering out of 
a window from above.  More likely sighting him in, which he confirmed 
with another retina switch to ultraviolet reflective, picking up the faint 
outlines of a needler rifle.

	"Nice try, Nemesis" came a voice that echoed through the alley.  It 
was Shiela all right.  Nothing mistaking that slyish voice.  He turned 
around, obviously out of position.  Two men, however, were between him 
and the streets, and the alley behind him meant dealing with his 
airborne sniper.  His right hand slowly snaked towards his jacket.

	"Don't even think about it asshole."  The two men in front of him 
took out their weapons, pinning him in.  "You go back to Nestroth and 
tell them we're back, Nemesis.  And, by the way, give Nebulus this 
message!?"  Two needler shots were fired from above into his shoulder.  
He immediately sank to the ground and crashed into a trash bin, holding 
his 'injured' shoulder.  "You take that to Nebulus!"

	The two men in the alley put their weapons away as they made 
their way back to the streets.  Nemesis lay there for a few minutes until 
he judged the situation as relatively safe to move.  He removed the 
needles from his jacket, simulating their penetration and induced pain.  
He walked out holding his shoulder.  He walked out without his friend.  
Heading back, passed the bar, gave him only one thought: Mogul is back 
and Cryon is on the move.  What the hell is going on?

	Chapter 3 : The Finer Things in Life...Just Got Worse

	"And here is the room where the hunter/killers will be operating 
from, General.  Each station will house one person and the collective will 
send necessary information to the GN-12 over there" pointed a research 
engineer for Cryon who was showing General Stark the first labs that 
would be used in Operation Revolt:  a joint military/government 
operation headed by members of the CIA, NSA, and USAF Electronic 
Security Command.  Behind the glassed in walls of the studio-like lab, the 
tour of the labs had come to an end for one of the leading officials in the 
implementation of the operation, as well as the leading researchers, 
programmers and engineers of Cryon and Nortech.  General Stark 
standing out by being the only one not in a normal suit with visible 
hardware and ports.

	"Very impressive, Dr. Rudenburg, very impressive." spoke 
General Stark looking at the GN-12 comp.  "Just how fast is that computer 
and will it give us instantaneous time to react if a priority is at hand?"

	"It's a 10 teraflops machine packaged in a secured housing that 
will be able to handle hundreds of users without slowing down a bit.  The 
computer has been programmed specifically to handle that type of a 
situation, should it arise.  With the latest advances made by Nortech in 
the human/computer interface field, the computer will be an extension 
of everyone working in the nets as well as off them.  The operation will 
begin as scheduled in two weeks.  You can be assured of that!" he stated 
with a grin as if he had sealed a done deal.  "If you come this way, we can 
move onto the final discussion of the networking reorder program and 
how we will integrate each level of defense as the time arises."

	The glass panels they were behind separated them from the most 
diabolical security system ever created by man.  Each station consisting 
of a 'coffin' where men would be connected into the computers and nets 
24 hours a day kept alive with a revolutionary new life support system.  
The General stood there for a last glimpse of the entire project.  His 
decorated chest rose and fell deeply with every deep breath.  'The 
teraflops computers.  The neural links.  The net connections and security 
systems.  So it all comes down to this.' the General thought to himself 
giving the place a once over, then moving on without a change of facial 
expression.  

	"So this project will enable us to monitor all of the Milnet sites 
and government linkup locations at any given time from anywhere, 
right?"

	"Exactly.  The hunter/killers will be spread out over the nets and 
gateways, constantly monitoring and tracking any conspicuous netters 
or runners as the case may be.  All the info will be processed here and 
we will be able build case files on perpetrators, or eliminate them if the 
risk is too high."

	"Sounds good to me.  We're practically fightin' a war on the nets 
as it is with all the netrunnin' that's been goin' on in the past few years.  
It's about goddamn time we got the hardware on our side to stop these 
punks" said the General.  His brow was more furrowed than before, 
remembering the numerous break-ins into his department alone over 
the past five years.  "Goddamn kids" he quietly spoke to himself, looking 
ahead with great anticipation for this project.  'Just wait until we fry 
'em' he smirked.

******************

	A few days later, a bare-chested dark-skinned bodybuilder was 
curling more weight than normal in front of a mirror at the local gym.  
A 'fake' medical bandage was taped to his left shoulder, giving him an 
incentive to pump more iron.  His biceps bulged every time the curl bar 
was lifted above waist level.  'I'm gonna kill Mogul, 18.  Kill Mogul, 19.  
Kill Mogul, 20.'  "Goddamn!" he said putting the bar back on its bench and 
flexing in front of the mirror.  He looked over himself with confidence.  
A full four hour workout finished again.  'Lookin' hot man, lookin' hot.'  
A cool sweat covered most of his unclothed body.  His spandex shorts 
noticeably wet as well.  He looked over his sculptured grayish tanned 
muscles until his gaze made it to his shades.  The dark purplish reflection 
in the mirror of his glasses spawned a frowning brow from Nemesis.  
'More muscles, more killing power!'  He picked the bar back up and 
curled another 10 reps, just to let the thought sink in, real deep, still 
counting by how many times he was going to kill Mogul.  He looked back 
at the mirror, breathing a little heavier than before.  His eyebrows now 
making a "V" shape in his forehead.  'That's it!  It's personal now, Mogul!  
You're MINE!'  

	He swiftly grabbed his bag and headed out the front of the gym 
into the warm summer afternoon.  His workout might be over, but his 
adrenaline was running high at the moment.  Flashbacks of Zlik and him 
being together for the first time.  Hitting the bars, scamming 
information, working with Nestroth.  Then the memory of the bar came 
back to him.  He saw the pain going through his friend's face.  He saw 
him stare death square in the face and then take his revenge before 
letting death take him.  And then, the only thought that entered his head 
was of Sheila.  "BITCH!"

	"Hey, Nemesis!"  A slap on the chest broke him from his day 
dreaming.  "Hey, man, you there today!?" asked Nebulus, catching him on 
his way down the street.

	"What do you want!?  I thought you never came out in daylight?" 
retaliated Nemesis.

	"Hey, calm down.  I was just coming up to see you in the gym and 
work out for a little while."

	"Then why are you in clothes that normally aren't seen outside of 
a club?"

	"OK, so I wasn't going to work out.  I was going to watch you" 
Nebulus said with a grin.  "Come on, let's get outta here.  My car's right 
over here."  They walked together towards the car, but Nemesis stopped a 
few steps away.  The whole thing was still eating him away, and Sheila 
was still in his head.

	"I don't think so; I'm really not in the mood right now, Nebulus."

	"Look, I know you're upset about what happened to Zlik, we all 
are, but there's work to do."

	"I don't care about work right now, damn it!  All I care about is 
taking Mogul down once and for all and NOW!" yelled Nemesis, becoming 
more furious by the moment.

	"Look asshole, I don't give a shit about how you feel or what you 
want to do!  There's work to do and I need you in one piece.  Now get you 
fuckin' ass in my goddamn car before I slice that rinkly stomach of 
yours open!" Nebulus retaliated pulling out a double sided rigid blade.

	The two just looked at each other for a second or two.  Finally, 
Nemesis moved towards the car, shouldering into Nebulus just to get a 
little frustration out on his way to grabbing the door.  Nebulus moved out 
of the way slightly, but ran the blade against Nemesis' stomach anyways.  
Nemesis just opened the door, loudly threw his bag in the back and 
slammed the door shut, letting his built-up anger go up in smoke.  
'Goddamn son of a bitch' he thought to himself as Nebulus got in the car 
and started driving away from the curb.

	"Didn't hurt a bit I bet, did it?" asked a frustrated Nebulus.

	"No."

	"How many layers of that shit have you put in you now...what are 
you up to four, five, twenty one or so..?" kidded Nebulus.

	Nemesis smirked.  His anger obviously starting to fade with the 
thought of his friend's humor.  "Only four.  Anymore would make it look 
unnatural.  And it's not shit, it's reinforced synthetic skin."

	"Unnatural.  You're only the one person in my life that I've ever 
seen with gray skin.  And a bodybuilder at that.  I thought you never put 
anything into your body that wouldn't help you grow muscles?"

	"It doesn't go into me; it's just sewn on the top five or so layers of 
skin."

	"Great.  A bodybuilder that has four layers of reinforced Kevlar 
Type II skin sewn into his skin so he's not only stronger than everyone 
else, he also has skin that's tougher than an alligator's."  The trip was 
silenced from then on by Nemesis' straight face and Nebulus' concern 
for what was going on with the nets.  Reality came back too quickly.  
Turning towards the west side of the city, Nemesis could tell that they 
were going to Nebulus' apartment.

	'What the fuck are we going to his house for?' Nemesis asked 
himself looking around.  The surrounding buildings, annoying traffic 
and light smog offered no answer.  Soon the apartment complex was up 
ahead.  Solar collectors sat atop the six story box shaped complex, soaking 
up as much sun from the hot day as possible.  An underground parking 
garage door swung open as the car passed the entrance into the 
driveway, allowing them access to Nebulus' traditional parking spot:  
directly opposite of the door on the far end of the garage.  Nemesis 
grabbed his bag and the two went up to the third floor apartment, 
getting in with the standard code key card.  The gray polymetal door 
swung open and the two entered the foyer.  Thick light colored carpet 
covered the floor of the spacious apartment.  Nemesis walked into the 
living room directly in front of him and looked out the full window at 
the nearby city.  'Pretty sad' he thought to himself, putting his bag down 
on a nearby sofa.  Nebulus followed and sat down, turning the TV on.

	"So what the hell are we doing here anyways?" demanded 
Nemesis, still staring out the window.

	"The others will be here soon enough.  Like I said, there's work to 
be done."

	"Then why don't you tell me just what the fuck is going on then, 
if it's so goddamn important!?" he retaliated spinning around to face 
Nebulus.  Nebulus sat there for a moment, still watching TV.  The volume 
was low enough it might as well have been off.  The spokesperson from 
ESPN was finishing a remote assignment to California on the discussion 
of the new steroids, the ones that had no physical or mental side effects.  

	"So, are you going to start taking the new steroids to help 
improve your strength?  I heard they can't hurt you at all." Nebulus said 
still watching TV.  Without receiving a reply, he turned to face Nemesis 
who was still waiting for an answer.  "All right.  Jack got word today 
from one of his friends in Nortech that said that Operation Revolt was 
scheduled to begin in two weeks."

	That hit a soft spot in Nemesis' pissed off mood.  'Two weeks.  Holy 
shit.  I didn't think they were going to be ready for at least a few more 
months.'  His mood switched from anger to passive worry, convincing 
him that sitting down was a good idea after all.  'How the fuck did they 
get that far ahead without our knowledge?'

	Nebulus went back to watching ESPN's coverage of body building 
which quickly grasped part of his companion's attention as well.  Within 
fifteen minutes, the program was nearing it's end when a message from 
the front panel sounded  "There is a visitor at the front door."  Nebulus 
got up and turned on the video monitor which vividly showed Slash and 
Jack.  

	"Who is it?" he asked anyways monotonely.

	"Open up, Nebulus." came back Slash's cool voice.

	"Lookin' good Slash."  He verified their presence with another 
window on the wall panel, displaying the thermal image of two people 
standing in the hallway outside his apartment door, taken from a sensor 
array strategically placed outside his room.  The door opened, and the two 
entered the room.

	"Don't you wish." said Slash as she walked past Nebulus in her 
civilian attire:  short heels, stockings that almost showed under a short 
summer skirt,  and a tight sleeveless top.  Jack followed her in, looking 
very concerned with the present state of affairs.  Being an employee of a 
company that his 'computer group' was about to attack and disable, put 
him in a very bad, not to mention stressful position.  The door slid shut 
behind him and locked with an advanced security lock that also included 
locking out telecom messages.

	Jack put himself in his normal office chair that sat at the near 
side of the couch, placed there just for him.  Normally it was used as a 
foot rest or end table, but Jack always sat in office chairs, no matter 
where he was.  Slash made her way to the cushy chair on the far side of 
the room that was within arms reach of Nemesis' side of the sofa.

	"I'm really sorry about Zlik, Nemesis.  I want you to know that." 
said Slash in a very sincere tone of voice.

	Nemesis gave her his thank you look and quickly moved to face 
Nebulus who was sitting back down on the sofa to address the group in 
one of their most important meetings of the year.

	"Thank you all for coming on such short notice.  I hope this 
hasn't complicated your jobs, but like I said, this is very important.  
Yesterday, Jack came to me with a very important message a friend at 
work had given to him involving Cryon's initiative, Operation Revolt.  
Jack, would you please brief the group on that matter?"

	"I received the following message from one of my contacts who 
keeps me informed on information with this project.  As you know, we 
were going after the project just for the capabilities to stay online 24 
hours a day.  But this changes things completely.  The message says:

		1-     OR to take over nets.  Hunter/killer
		group to use LSS to keep punks off nets.
		MIL/GOV//MIL/GOV/unknown-deadly     -3

	The reason why this changes everything are the hunter/killer 
groups and the involvement of the government and military.  This is one 
of the first times that the government and military have gone after 
totally securing the nets.  To begin with it will be applied to the 
government and military nets, but I think it will eventually spread to 
even the simplest network interface on the local level, purposely 
designed to keep unauthorized personnel out, period.  They are playing 
for keeps this time.  I think the answer to the question about why has 
Cryon been going after other companies and mil sites is right here as 
well.  They've been breaking into places left and right as a testing 
ground for what they can do and how effective their system is.  We've 
been watching the whole damn project run it's prototypes and beta tests 
all along.  The people that were in the tests are the ones we will be up 
against when the game begins, if this project succeeds in starting on 
time."  He ran his hand through his thinning hair.  His shirt collar was 
long unbuttoned and his tie loose.  "This puts me in one awkward 
position, but that's why I got with you guys in the first place.  This 
project will essentially shut down the nets from the outside, and I can't 
see anyway of getting around it."

	"Yea, but they can't KILL you.  I mean, all they can do is find out 
who you are and where you're getting in from.  That's old news I 
thought." attacked Slash.  She knew her way around net tech and was 
pretty up to date on the present state of it, but what she hated the most 
was not being informed on what was out there and this put a noticeable 
hitch in her tone.

	"With the new system, there's no telling what they can do.  They 
could decide not to attack you, trace you back to your deck.  From there 
they could get every bit of information on you without you knowing it.  
Set bugs.  Implant viruses.  Build cases about you.  Contact others to see if 
you have any weaknesses.  Destroy your personal file and plant a virus 
to destroy every copy of it you launch.  Who knows.  These guys are 
playing hardball and they're playing for keeps!"

	The room was completely silent with the exception of a thousand 
thoughts of concern coming from each person sitting there.

	"Well, I guess this means that Mogul is on the back burner" 
sighed Nemesis, folding his hands together in his lap.  A few grins 
appeared quickly looking to relieve the stress of the room.

	"We need a plan of attack to begin with" said Slash slouching 
back in her chair, allowing the bottoms of her stocking to show without 
concern.  Nemesis was the first to notice and the only one to stare, 
unnoticed of course.  His CRI's zoomed in on one area, trying to get a 
closer picture.  'Business is business, but pleasure is pleasure' he thought 
to himself.  He never could grasp cyberspace that well and couldn't 
concentrate on it that much since he had never jacked in before and 
probably never would.

	"Fine.  First:  Jack, you need to keep gathering as much info as 
possible from the nets and from work.  We need to know what we're 
going up against and when.  Second:  Slash, I need you to assess Cryon's 
security.  Work with your security company to get into the place and see 
what you can dig up.  Third:  Nemesis, I need you to resecure all of our 
sites, systems, apartments and personal gear.  I want to be ready for 
anything that hits us, either from Cryon or Mogul.  Also I need you to be 
our street info man.  There probably isn't much on the streets now, but I 
want to get as much of a jump on this as possible.  Also, keep a close eye 
on Mogul.  Keep them out of range, but don't overextend yourself without 
backup, and only under extreme circumstances.  Cryon takes priority 
until further notice.  Meanwhile, I will make contact with some of the 
higher ups I know and will converge all info to you all.  Keep all 
information pertaining to this thing as secret as possible.  Don't use the 
nets at all and make sure you're not being tracked!"

	The meeting soon broke up, each person going their individual 
way.  There was nothing more that really needed to be said, or could be 
said.  They needed more information and without it were dead in the 
water.  Nebulus walked back to the large window in the living room and 
looked out at the city below.  It was getting late in the afternoon, but 
work was just beginning.  'So they've finally come up with a way to shut 
us out, huh.  So it's all come to this.  And if ICE weren't enough.  Now I 
have to combat another person on the net who is playing Mr. Security 
Officer, standing between me and my objective.  That is, if they ever get 
into the nets!  That's it.  We'll have to kill the project before it even 
becomes operational!'

***************

	Five days had passed and the group was together once again, this 
time to compare information.  If nothing else, they were all more 
worried and more intense with every move they made.  Here was a 
technology and a capability so revolutionary in the field of computer 
security that it could wipe out the majority of cracking that goes on 
within any and all nets.

	The four sat around one of the tables in the back room at Hot 
Kicks, a private club owned by Nebulus on the better side of town.  It was 
an almost middle class joint, if there was a middle class any more.  If 
there was it was called surviving with a little more.  The joint was classy.  
It was where all the sophisticated people went who wanted to see live 
nude dancing and strippers that wouldn't make you vomit.  There was 
both male and female entertainment as well as artwork, decks, 
holographics, laser shows and live or holographic music.  It was a 
hangout for artsy types, social groupies, or horny people.  The room they 
were in was behind all the glitter and glamour of the place.  It was the 
business area of the joint.

	"Well, I guess I'll be the one to start things" spoke Jack, eagerly 
wanting the meeting to begin so that he could get as much of a jump on 
the project as possible.  Being the netrunner of the group, he needed as 
much prep time as possible, and the most info as well.  "The project is 
still scheduled to start on time in nine days.  The beta testing that has 
been going on over the past four months, has included over 25 
businesses, 20 military installations, and 10 government sites.  Successful 
cracks were made in all cases and successful defense routines were 
completed without problems.  The people who will be in the nets will be 
on life support for one month at a time.  They will be receiving fluids, 
muscle stimuli and other necessities while in the nets.  They will be 
connecting into the nets through a large comp that I suspect is a 
supercomputer, but have not yet confirmed.  With this type of computing 
power, they will be able to bring a lot of software into the nets with them 
and will be able to be monitored from outside, while still maintaining 
contact with the others in the nets.  ICE could never touch the killing 
power that this could produce" Jack finished with a seriously straight 
face.

	"Cryon's physical security is very tight.  My security firm is 
presently supporting ten positions within the company, none of which 
are located near this project.  Security systems and facility maps are 
located within the main system there, and should be breakable without 
much trouble, once you get past the outer systems.  I can arrange to have 
two of our special tactics team help us with the break in.  They're 
specifically trained for this sort of thing and we have no records of them 
at all."

	"Yea, but can they be trusted?" darted Jack, obviously feeling the 
pressure of breaking into a place this big, and going against an 
operation of this magnitude.

	"My people are loyal to me.  As long as we keep them from the 
truth and don't have them go all the way in, we should be ok.  In any 
case, they are expendable if problems arise.  Are there any other 
questions?" challenged Slash.  She wouldn't have come up with the idea 
if she didn't think it weren't safe, and she hated people who attacked her 
judgments.

	"All right.....Nemesis" called Nebulus, keeping the meeting in 
order.

	"All security systems and meeting places have been tested, 
verified and put on maximum alert sequences.  If anything even comes 
close to messin' with our stuff, it'll be eliminated.  The word on the street 
is nothin'.  This project is the quietest one I've ever heard of.  Nobody's 
even heard of it yet.  Mogul is still around, but they don't seem to be 
movin' anytime in the next few days.  They're mainly getting contacts 
and settin' up sites.  All personal gear has been maintained and weapon 
banks are in full, working condition.  They'll be ready when the time 
comes to jump."

	"Last but not least, the big guys will be comin' into town on the 
day the project is implemented.  Hotel reservations were made months 
ago and security teams have been assigned from the normal companies.  
I scrounged some extra cash in case we needed anything to further our 
chances of survival.  This one's gonna be the big hit for this year, that's 
for sure" said Nebulus moving to the front of his chair and putting his 
arms down on the table.

	"What is that supposed to mean?" asked Slash.

	"We are going to attack this project before it can be implemented 
and we're gonna go into Cryon to do it."

	"Are you nuts!?  There's no fuckin' way we can attack from 
within Cryon!" bitched Jack, standing up to contest the whole plan.

	"If we let them into the nets, we're dead.  They win, we loose.  
They will be more powerful than ICE ever could think of being.  You 
should know that, Jack" Nebulus retaliated disgustingly as if talking to a 
high school punk that never learned to think with an open mind.  

	'Great.  He's already starting to crack and the fun hasn't even 
begun' thought Slash looking disappointingly at Jack.

	Nebulus got up from his seat and walked over to Jack, who had 
walked away from the table to unbutton his shirt even more.  Slash and 
Nemesis looked at each other with that 'Oh, great' look, knowing each 
other couldn't wait for the action.

	Nebulus put his hands in his baggy pants pockets as he stood next 
to Jack.  "Look.  I know you're in a really bad position if anything goes 
wrong.  But you're in it with us and you know you want to go through 
with it.  Just relax and take an anti-stress pill and calm down.  I need you 
in one piece to pull this off from the inside or we're not going 
anywhere."  He walked away knowing that Jack wouldn't let him down.  
Every now and then when they did something big, Jack was the one to 
get nervous.  He was great on the nets and could crack more than most, 
but his nerves were made of shit until the actual time came to work.

	"So where's my woman, Nebulus?" asked Nemesis jokingly.

	"Julia is downstairs waitin' for ya' in the dressin' room."  

	"Julia this time, huh."  Since the meeting was essentially over, 
Nemesis decided to go play, leaving the group behind to drink or do 
whatever they wanted to.

	"How pathetic" mumbled Slash as her combative partner left the 
room.  He paid no attention to her comment, as usual.

			Chapter 4 : Pawn to Rook 4

	"How the hell do you expect me to come up with that kind of 
security information by tomorrow morning?  There's got to be a dozen or 
more hard locks on that place, not to mention getting around ICE" 
complained Jack, trying to make Nebulus understand the tight security 
at Cryon.

	"Jack, take a chill pill.  So it'll take a few more hours than normal.  
Just get it done as soon as possible.  We need as much info as possible so 
we can pull this off."

	"And what if we can't?  Why the hell is getting this stuff off line 
so important anyways?  It's not like we're trying to protect every 
netrunner in the country."  Nebulus dropped a few tablets on the desk 
the two were sitting at.  Jack watched them rolled around on a pile of 
computer paper until they spun around and stopped toward one edge.  By 
the time Jack looked up at Nebulus, he had already walked away, 
thinking about something else.  To Nebulus, nothing was impossible.  It 
was just a matter of coming up the right plan of attack.

	"Shit" mumbled Jack to himself, picking up the two pills.  
'Probably only iron tablets' he thought putting them in his mouth and 
downing them with the Coke sitting on his desk.  'Everything must be 
duplicated.  All security systems must be located and analyzed.  Personnel 
and schedules must be analyzed.  What a fuckin' bitch!'  He jacked back 
into Cryon gathering the last bit of information that was necessary to 
invade as he always called it.

	A few hours later, the group was together once again for last 
checks on the plan of attack.  The meeting place was the same warehouse 
that Nemesis and Slash had gone to after taking out Dave.  Kind of ironic 
since it is usually a place to go after the fact.  It quaintly went along with 
Nebulus' ego, though.  Good for dealing in the black markets; bad for 
dealing with friends.  But then again, they all did live on the edge just 
for that rush of adrenaline.  For Nemesis, that was his drug of choice.

	"So are we gonna go in and tear this place up or what" Nemesis 
said loudly sitting down at the large meeting table that was probably 
designed to be a stretch dining room table.  It had been refinished and 
had a monitor array placed into it so that it took up most of the table face.  
He placed his combat boots up on the table and faced the head of the table 
where Nebulus sat.

	"Pig" joked Slash, sitting across from him.

	"So who are your friends, Slash?" asked Nemesis, gathering a 
straight face, ready for business.

	Slash turned to her right where one of her two 'friends' were 
seated.  He was dressed in almost all black leather, with a black hair cut 
resembling Nemesis' with a gold earring to top it off with style.  "This is 
Aberdon.  And she is Donna" pointed Slash, looking at her other friend 
who was sitting next to Nemesis who noted her long stocking-clad legs.  
Her miniskirt and skimpy top left little to the imagination and much to 
be desired, at least as far as Nemesis was concerned, who was becoming 
aroused as his eyes caressed her legs very slowly.

	"And what do you do for a living" he smirked eyeing her over his 
shoulder, getting as much of a lookover as he could get away with.

	"Looks like I'll be coverin' your ass macho man" she replied with 
a nasty tone of voice, never letting her intimidating facial expression 
change.

	He laughed.  He laughed sarcastically loud.  "So where do we stand 
on info?" he said dropping his bullshit like a mercury weight.

	"We've got most of the blueprints for the place in question 
including security and surveillance systems, piping and electrical, and 
nets.  Security schedules are being analyzed by the comps still and tap in 
sites are being assessed as to hard connects" came back Jack who sat at 
the other head of the table.  He touched the table screen a few times and 
a general blueprint of the main floor and grounds came into view.  "This 
is the general layout of the place, he said adding mini windows of the 
basement levels.  The target site is on the absolute bottom floor of the 
building, and it's pretty heavily guarded and secured.  It's going to take a 
lot to get to it" he said with a little worry.  He was getting used to the 
situation and finally excited about the job, but still slightly intimidated 
with the size of the operation.  It was the largest job he'd ever done and it 
was one of the few that involved both people on the nets and in the 
physical objective site.

	"Piece of cake" confidently spoke up Aberdon.

	"Yea?  So how would you attack it!?" attacked Slash.  Nebulus sunk 
a little deeper in his chair, awaiting this test.

	"Once the electronics are secure, a team will go in the rear 
security zone by entering this loading zone, here" he said pointed to a 
grid on the monitor.  "From there, one of us will take over that physical 
security site to control the area.  From there, whoever's runnin' will lead 
the group through checkpoints by disarming systems and allowing them 
to enter secured sectors.  Any guards can be removed by our new 
security guard and diverted temporarily.  Then it's just a matter of 
pullin' things together.  Piece of cake."

	"Not bad...not bad" spoke Nebulus, sitting back up in his chair.  
"Almost like we had talked about earlier."  Putting his elbows on the 
table, he glanced over the prints one more time.  The room was silent.  
All eyes were on Nebulus since he had the final say on the plan.  He stood 
up and took off his jacket, placing it on the back of the chair.

	"But it won't work.  The security layout would never get you past 
the main gate.  Cryon doesn't accept night deliveries.  No one goes in or 
out after dark, period" said Jack, standing his ground against a plan as 
simple as that.  "So the question is, how do we get to the dock without 
being noticed at all."

	"Sewer system.  It's the oldest trick in the book, but I bet you it 
would work" said Nemesis.

	"Don't be stupid.  A company like that isn't dumb enough to leave 
their pipes clear" snapped Slash, expecting more from an experienced 
front man.

	"Yea, but all the outside pipes aren't connected to the inside pipes.  
They're all for rain, not sewage.  Look.  There's not one connection from 
the building pipes to the outside pipes.  In fact, it looks like all the inner 
pipes go down to the basement and out the bottom of the structure 
through smaller pipes into an underground piping system I would guess.  
There's a man hole near the docks that I bet connects to the city sewers" 
pondered Jack, getting more intrigued with the possibilities of actually 
pulling this stunt off.

	"Check it out.  Make sure they're clean and that the pipes are 
large enough for men with equipment to get through.  If it is, we'll go 
with it.  I had a similar idea to the one proposed.  I'll pose as a guard and 
help the team get through each level of security.  Nemesis, get me a wish 
list of equipment to get the job done.  Then you and Aberdon get the stuff 
ready.  Slash, you and Donna look over every micron of this plan and 
make sure it works.  Make detailed notes on everything we will need to 
know about this place.  Jack, continue working on info and breaking 
systems.  Also, get the ROMS ready to write to with the info Slash gives 
you.  Meanwhile, I'll get some party favors.  Aberdon and Donna, you are 
staying with us until this is over, understand!"  commanded Nebulus.  
This was it.  If there were any questions, now was the time to bring it up.  
Once the plan was set, it was set.  There were no objections.

	August 21.  Friday, early morning.  The humid air hung stagnate 
outside the metal door of a warehouse in the shipping district.  Launch 
Site 13 as it was called.  All missions were started here.  This one was just 
bigger than most.  Usually, it was mainly netrunning to get information.  
This time it involved flesh and blood almost more than fiber optic cables.  
Nemesis stood outside the door waiting for the rest to arrive.  He looked at 
his watch.  '3:49.  One minute to go' he thought.  A lone docking light far 
away painted a soft, white brush stroke of light across his bare chest and 
the warehouse behind him.  'Forty seconds to go.'

	The dull hum of a van came from around the far side of the 
warehouse, moving slowly along the gravel drive.  The headlights were 
turned off as the garage size door of the warehouse began to open, 
spilling an ambient light onto the gravel.  Nemesis opened the personnel 
door behind him and walked through closing it behind him and locking 
it.  The black beaten up van crept past the open garage to turn around 
and enter backwards.  The garage door began to close as Nemesis walked 
up to the back of the van and opened the doors with a sharp creaking.  
The gang was here.  

	"Right on time" he said.

	"Time to party" said Slash being the first to get out of the crowded 
van.  Everyone in the back were sitting on A3 cases that were unloaded 
first by Nemesis and Aberdon.  Stacking them sideways to each other, 
Nebulus brought the pass card up, giving the privilege to Donna who 
aggressively ran it through the bar reader of the first one she came to.  
The green light on the handle block went on and an internal lock 
disengaged with a soft pop.  She opened it up and everyone looked in.

	"My, my, aren't we gonna have fun tonight" glowed Slash looking 
at the case full of explosives.  

	"C4-type II, IRAPM's, concussion bombs, hand grenades, 
hey....where's my grenade launcher?" joked Nemesis looking at Nebulus.

	"Look in case two.  Each one of you has a personal case that is 
openable with that card.  Everything you need is in there.  Merry 
Christmas kids."

	"How much did this cost you anyways?" asked Slash with a grin.

	"After I told them why we were going in, they practically gave it 
to me just to secure their other investments.  To answer your question, 
no you can't keep it" he replied with a grin that stretched from ear to 
ear.

	The transformation began.  Everyone began getting their clothes 
on and their body armor secured.  All of the smiles had left by the time 
4:00 AM rolled around.  Weapons were checked and rechecked.  
Ammunition and explosives were properly attached and weapons slung.  
Jack had already disappeared into the basement of the place; a secret 
room under the floor where the master comps were located.  The comps 
sucked power directly from the power station that was not more than a 
quarter mile away.  That way the general power loss could be attributed 
to humidity or any other stupid, unexplainable phenomenon.

	"On line in one minute!" yelled Nebulus from his makeup case.  
Everyone was already ready, checking each other over.  Nebulus jacked 
in quickly checking on Jack's status.

	"On line!"

	The four got side by side.  The seriousness and concentration 
hung in the air almost as thick as the humidity.  Beads of sweat had 
formed on every one's forehead.  Foot steps were heard from the far side 
of the warehouse and Jack soon appeared out of the homemade wooden 
office, heading towards the group.  

	"Are you ready?" questioned Nebulus.

	"Comps are set.  Once you get in, you'll have less than 10 minutes 
to complete the job, which in this case is plenty of time.  One minute to 
secure the desk.  Two minutes to get to subbasement 4.  One minute for 
diversions and gaining access.  Three minutes for setting the bombs and 
getting out.  That leaves you with one minute to blow the place and two to 
get out" said Jack.

	"And that's worse case scenario, right?" asked Nebulus, hinting 
that Jack was underestimating their abilities.

	"Yeah.  In reality, you'll probably do it in half that time, so just 
keep me informed of where you are and everything will go OK.  I'll be 
able to track you anyways, so don't worry too much."

	"All right.  See you in a few then."

	"Good luck, and if everything goes wrong, I'll just blow the net if 
I can.  That way, any system assignment will be destroyed."

	"Good deal.  Lets get going" said Nebulus looking back at his 
group.  Dressed in solid black from head to toe stood the attack team.  
Expanded honeycomb titanium armor plated Spectra 3000 body armor 
hugged every curve of their bodies, protecting them from most 
firepower out today.  Explosives and equipment was strategically secured 
to the armor for quick, but easy use.  After a quick checkover, they took 
their seats in the back of the van with Nebulus navigating and Donna 
driving.  It took twenty minutes to get there.  The corporation had a 
large complex just outside of city limits.  An old apartment complex had 
been renovated and made into an employees park which housed 
thousands of people.  The six story concrete apartments stood above a not 
so beautiful street that had it's fair share of crime, vandalism and street 
gangs.  The van was parked in an alley just out of site of the complex.

	"Comms on.  Mic check" said Nemesis. Everyone donned their 
small headset/mic.  Nebulus had a lapel mike with a single ear speaker 
that had been placed under the fake skin of his disguise that finished the 
security officer uniform he wore under his wet suit.

	"One."  "Two."  "Three."  "Four."  "Five." the group replied in order.

	"Sounding good everyone.  Jack, check in" came back Nebulus.

	The line was dead for a second.  "God here.  RYLAC."

	"How can he hear us?" asked Donna looking over at Nebulus.

	"He wrote a program to interface his deck with a comm system.  It 
shows up as a two-way speaker in his environment.  Sync watches on 
4:56 on five, four, three, two, one, mark."  Watches were synced.  
"Injection time people."  Each person, including Nemesis, took out a small 
packet that contained three vials with needles.  Nemesis took out the first 
vial which contained a clear liquid and injected himself with the 
adrenalizer, designed as a short term super steroid with little side effects.  
The first needle was placed back and the second vial was injected in the 
same area of the arm.  This one was a sense and reflex enhancer 
designed by the military.  It would give them better combat reflexes 
when they needed it.  This was followed by a third injection of a pain 
killer.  It was designed to not activate until a large amount of pain was 
inflicted, then it just temporarily deadened the area's nerve system.  
Designer drugs, designed for combat.  Perfect for terrorist raids.

	"5:00.  Time to go people" said Nebulus fastening his wet suit shut.  
Face masks were put on, covering everything but their eyes, and 
equipment and weapons were gathered.  The five exited the van silently 
and moved over the man hole located a few feet from the van.  A quick 
jimmy with a bar and the lid slid over with a low screech.  A quick look 
around and Nebulus was the first in, followed by the two newbees as 
Nemesis viewed it.  

	"I hope we can trust these two!" firmly whispered Nemesis to 
Slash, who gave him her look of approval before jumping in.  Within 
seconds the whole team was in the sewer system.  Pipes lined the old 
concrete and stone walls.  The water level was only thigh deep so it didn't 
prove to be very cumbersome.  

	"You checked this place out OK, right 3?" asked Nebulus over the 
comm.

	"Two gates were cleared.  Everything is a go."

	Night vision glasses allowed easy travel through the system for 
the first fifty or so feet until voices were heard from behind.  Everyone 
stopped.  Aberdon, who was trailing, turned around, crouching to the 
water level.  It sounded like kids.  Then it was as two street punks stuck 
their heads down into the sewers looking for the vanished group of 
strangers.  One reached a hand down below his head, visibly carrying a 
flash light.  Before he tuned it on, two silent needler shots were fired and 
the bodies of two dead kids splashed into the water below, creating a little 
wake that was eventually felt by the assassin.

	"Too bad" said Nemesis leading the group once again through the 
small cavern.  "Let's go."  They traveled through the sewers with very 
little trouble.  The tunnels were relatively flat and the footing was still 
firm due to the recent construction of Cryon some 10 years ago.  Nemesis' 
night vision led them on until the man hole cover was reached near the 
loading docks of the company.  "God.  How does the weather look?" asked 
Nebulus, who had unzipped the top part of his suit after reaching the 
ladder which led to the surface.

	Jack had been in the net for some time now, checking on 
programs, root operations, and watching out for ICE.  "Security checking 
will be done in one minute" came back Jack.

	'One minute.  Come on.  Hurry up' thought Nemesis, quite eager to 
get this job started.  The adrenalizer was beginning to take effect.  
Watches were being checked until the second before the security 
program checker was finished, exactly 5:10 AM.

	"Go" said Jack.  Nebulus had already shed his wet suit and Nemesis 
had slid the man hole cover out of the way while being covered by 
Donna.  Nebulus was the first out, quickly running up to the docking 
door.  He was quickly followed by the rest of the group who crouched by 
the sides of the door, waiting for Nemesis to put the cover back on.  He 
finished and regrouped with the team who had taken off their glasses to 
allow their eyes to adjust to the indoor light emanating from the door.  
Nebulus entered.  He quickly walked down the hallway and turned left 
towards the security desk that monitored that side of the complex.  The 
security guard at the desk came into view and stood up as he approached 
the desk.

	"Who are you and what are you doing in this section of the 
building?" the guard asked in a not so calm tone of voice.  Obviously the 
security had been upgraded for Operation Revolt.

	Nebulus walked around so that he was next to the guard.  "We've 
got a problem in section 5" he replied bringing his arm from behind his 
back.  He thrust his hand forward into the guards throat, knocking him 
out with a stunner.  The guard shakingly fell to the floor and was kicked 
under the desk.  TV monitors lined the panel in front of him that had 
four jack in sites.  

	"God this is one.  Secure all personnel sensors and override all 
subsystems in this section to me" spoke Nebulus outloud into his comm 
mic.  

		Jack looked down onto the gaming board on the 
	table in front of him.  An elaborate table top created like 
	an old model train scene had been transformed into a 
	World War II battlefield.  Moving armies in Eastern Europe 
	moved on the forest-like layout depicting the different 
	programs going on.  He immediately spotted the correct 
	security program that monitored the security personnel's 
	heart rate from individual sensors mounted on their 
	watch bands.  He touched his finger to a spot near the 
	army foot soldier representing the algorithm and blinked 
	into the battlefield in front of the corporal with his 
	superuser privileges and general's uniform.  He 	
	immediately attacked the young soldier with his bayonet-
	tipped M1 rifle and fought him down to the ground where 
	he thrust the nine inch bayonet blade into the soldiers 
	chest, terminating the program's operation.  He returned 
	to his chair in front of the table again, this time wearing 
	a replica of Patton's uniform.  "Done" was his reply to 
	Nebulus.

	"Team in" ordered Nebulus who took control of the video cameras, 
freezing them onto walls.  He jumped into cyberspace with his God given 
superuser access to check for personnel in the area.  A map of the floor 
came up with personnel locations and details.  He jumped out, routing the 
ground floor and the first three basements to the monitors in front of 
him.  

	The team quickly arrived, hauling their over-and-under 
weapons, and party favors with them.  A quick look at the monitors and 
Nemesis was off first seeking the entrance to the elevators.  Slash took 
off after him, followed by the two others right behind.  The corridors 
were lightly painted and had industrial carpet lining most of the halls.  
A few more turns through the halls and the group came to a halt behind 
a wall, separating them from the two security officers stationed at the 
elevator.

	"One.  Problem at elevator" whispered Nemesis into his mic.

	"Security at elevator 4, sector 6g : move promptly to sector 5g and 
report back in to gate on arrival" announced Nebulus, speaking into the 
security's comm.  The guards looked at each other for a moment, 
questioning the command from their security base.

	"Request secure ID verification" came back one of the guards.

	"ID hold out 764421 confirm" replied Nebulus, reading the code 
from one of the monitors.  The guard motioned to his partner and the two 
walked off towards sector 5g, watching the offices as they went.  As they 
moved out of site, the lights indicating that the elevator was moving 
down turned on.  The group stayed still.

	"One.  Someone's on the..." spoke Slash.

	"Team.  Backtrack to stairs.  Take first flight down and move 
towards sector 2."  Donna spun around and headed back first, frantically 
leading the group.  If they were caught now, the show would be over 
right then.  The stairs soon appeared in a side corridor and were entered.   
The heavy fire-proof door was shut with a soft thud and Slash was the 
first to go down the concrete stairs.  The walls were solid white and were 
dimly lit by night security lights.  

	The door to the first subbasement was reached and opened.  Slash 
peered around and saw no one.  The walls were only four feet tall in this 
sector.  Offices were separated by a few grids of these as far as she could 
tell by the dim light.  Shadows snaked down the halls, carving light into 
odd shapes and strokes by the bookcases and supporting pillars.  The 
team entered the floor and proceeded right along the hallway.  

	"No guards until the elevator" spoke Nebulus into his comm.  The 
team hugged the right wall, silently treading down the hallway, 
stopping every twenty feet to check to make sure no guards were 
walking rounds within the offices.  Just because the security monitors 
didn't show any guards, there was no absolute guarantee.

	Sector 2 was finally reached.  Nemesis looked at his watch.  
5:11:43.  Just a bit behind schedule, but nothing significant enough to 
worry about.

	"Let's take the stairs from now on" whispered Donna.  "That way, 
they can't track us."

	"Forget it.  The elevator's right nearby" darted Nemesis 
continuing on in the general direction of the elevator.  'Who the fuck 
does she think she is!  This is my plan and my attack.  She's just along for 
the ride!'  They reached the corner of the hallway in front of the 
elevator.

	"Watch out!  There's..." trailed Nebulus.

	"One.  What's it like?" asked Nemesis, itching to get into a fight 
right about now.

	"Hold it right there!  Don't move!" yelled a guard from behind the 
group.  They slowly turned around as two more guards came from the 
elevator area.  They all had on armored vests and carried high caliber 
handguns, all pointed at the group.  "Sidney, call into base and notify 
them to send more people!" commanded the first guard, still pointing his 
gun at Slash.  "Drop it now!"

	Nemesis faced the two guards that had come from the elevator and 
slowly started to pivot around towards Aberdon who was right behind 
him.  Slash and Donna began to put their weapons on the ground, 
crouching in anticipation.

	"Base, this is" spoke a guard into his comm.

	"Now!" yelled Nemesis, laying down a spray of needlers at the two 
guards in front of him.  Aberdon spun around in Slash's direction 
cutting the first guard to pieces with an array of silenced hard 
ammunition.  Three guards now lay dead on the floor, their blood 
staining the carpet underneath them.

	"I told you we needed armor piercers" spoke Nemesis at Aberdon.  
"Anything less, wouldn't have killed them."

	"Too bad for standard armor vests.  Next time, wear something 
better than that" scoffed Slash grinning over the dead bodies.

	"Team, what's up?" asked Nebulus over the comm.

	"Thanks for the warning, one.  We just waxed three of 'em" 
replied Nemesis, dragging one into an office room.  The other two were 
placed under the desks in one of the nearby offices as well in hope of 
temporarily concealing their presence.

	The elevator door was opened and the group entered, pressing the 
button for subbasement 4 on the panel.  The doors shut and the elevator 
began to move down.

	"Guards in sector 2DD, report to sector 4DD immediately" spoke 
Nemesis into the security comm.  He looked back at the monitors, 
bringing up the bottom two levels.  'More guards at the key points.  More 
security blockades to bypass.  Shit.  Guards are moving in on the elevator 
in sector 2DD.'

	  "One, this is God.  Security ID failed.  They won't listen to you 
now.  Presently blocking communications to other sectors."

	"What the hell happened" asked Nebulus getting quite pissed by 
now that the plan was getting fucked up.

	"The security is tighter than I thought.  Out."

	The elevator stopped, but it wasn't at subbasement 4.  The team 
looked around and at the panel, trying to find out what was wrong.  
"Team, this is God.  Break out of the top hatch and find another way back 
into the building.  Security is on to you."

	"Shit!" yelled Nemesis very mad that the plan had failed.

	"We're still in so don't fuck up!" yelled Slash.	

	"Everybody, get back!" yelled Aberdon, pushing the group to the 
opposing side of the elevator from the doors.  He aimed his grenade 
launcher from under his gun, and fired at the floor, just under the doors.  

	"NO!!!!" yelled Slash.  Before she could do anything about it, the 
grenade impacted on the floor and exploded filling the cabin with fire, 
smoke and a shock wave that threw everyone to the floor.  The far side of 
the floor blew out destroying the lower part of the doors as well.  Slowly, 
Slash looked up to view the damage, her ears were ringing from the 
blast.  Black smoke filled the cabin allowing almost no visibility.  

	"Two.  What the hell can you see?" she asked Nemesis, pulling him 
to sit up.

	He switched his eyes to infra-red and then to ultraviolet, trying 
to get a better picture of the cabin.  "The floor's about half gone and the 
doors are severely damaged."  The cabin swayed a little in the elevator 
shaft as the team began to regain itself.

	"One this is three.  How the hell do we get out of here!" screamed 
Slash into her comm.  The earphone just buzzed; the diaphragm 
completely shredded from the shock wave.  "One this is three, come in."  
Nothing.  "Shit!  We're cut off!  Why the fuck did you blow the elevator 
like that you moron!?  You killed the goddamn comms!" she yelled 
throwing her comm to the ground.

	"Wait.  Elevator ladder.  Come on" said Nemesis venturing into the 
grayish-black smoke, his mask temporarily giving him a filter to breath 
through.  His adrenaline pushing him onward, Nemesis crouched near 
the hole and reached out for the rung of the ladder nearest to him.

	"God, this is one.  Secure fire alarms and all security sectors not 
in this area.  I want my team to be shut off from everyone else.  We've 
lost communications with them."  

		Jack stood up from his playing board and 
	proceeded to another one :  another level of security.  He 
	sat down at the second board dressed in a Civil War 
	General's uniform.  The gold braids from his blue epaulets 
	dangled near the surface as he closely looked over the 
	terrain.  He found where he wanted to be and placed his 
	finger at the spot only to appear there instantly.  

		He stood in the Union Army's camp under overcast 
	skies looking around for the program he wanted to kill.  
	"Young man, come here!" he yelled in a northern accent 
	at one of the messenger boys.

		"Yes sir" the boy said breathing hard from 
	carrying messages as he stood at attention in front of 
	General Jack.  His weathered uniform and tattered pants 
	could hardly be classified as a uniform, but yet it worked 
	well with his position.

		"Where can I find the lad who's carryin' the 
	message about the fire?"

		"That'd be me, sir.  I'm sorry I haven't gotten it out 
	yet, but they blocked my normal way out and I can't get 
	by."

		"Why don't you give the message to me and I'll 
	make sure that it gets out, son" he said holding his gloved 
	hand outward to the young boy.

		"But sir, I.."

		"Now, son!" he commanded, lowering his voice to a 
	thunderous growl.

		"Yes sir." he replied giving Jack the message.  He 
	looked confused with the order, but was not about to 
	disobey a general.

		"Now git goin' kid."  The boy turned slowly around 
	and then started to walk off looking for another problem 
	to report.  Then he collapsed about ten feet from Jack as 
	his head exploded from the .50 caliber flint lock pistol ball 
	that pierced the back of his head.  No one paid attention as 
	they were not programmed to monitor his operation.  He 
	landed face first into the muddy ground as Jack put the 
	gun back in it's holster at his side and blinked out of the 
	board, leaving the message to be erased.

	Nebulus had yet to be nervous, but he wasn't exactly calm 
anymore as he found the remote sensing information and popped it up 
on the screen of one of his monitors.  After a little searching he changed 
the monitors to display the motion sensor and thermal sensor 
information from the different floors.  'Elevator shaft.  What the fuck 
are they doing in a goddamn elevator shaft?' he thought to himself.

	"Hold it right there, mister!" yelled a guard from behind Nebulus.  
"Don't move, don't even breathe!"  The guard and his two counterparts 
slowly walked around, surrounding him at the guard desk.  "Do you 
really think we were that stupid!?" asked the guard.

	"Who the hell are you and what are you doing in my sector?" 
confronted Nebulus, unfamiliar with the uniforms.  The guards were 
decked out in military-style commando garb, carrying heavy caliber 
rifles and explosives.

	"We're the other half of the security that you didn't take into 
consideration in your plan.  Now shut up!"

	"Hey!  There is no other side of security that I don't know about!  
Now put those guns down before I notify security and make this a big 
mess!" ordered Nebulus, standing up to face the leader of the group who 
stood on the other side of the security desk across from him.  'Shit.  
Heavy bore weapons, needlers, grenades and explosives.  They really are 
military.  Lieutenant DeGrace.  Oh, shit...' he thought to himself as his 
eyes looked down to the ground in front of his adversaries' boots.  A 
single hand stuck out underneath the desk.

	"Mistake number one, asshole.  Now sit down" said Lieutenant 
DeGrace.  He slowly gripped the arms of the chair and sat down, hoping 
that the commandos wouldn't take notice of what was on the monitors 
yet.  'Come on Jack.  Call me.  Call me.'

	"One this is God."

	"One is dead" was his only reply.  The monitors blinked out and 
Nebulus' comm went dead as one of the commando's behind him grabbed 
him by the throat and forced him to the ground backwards, shoving a 
needler into his throat as his head firmly hit the floor.

	"Your body armor won't protect you from this, now will it" 
sneered the commando, living for the fight.  Nebulus just laughed, and 
continued to laugh sarcastically until he was silenced with the butt of a 
gun against his head.

	"The hunt is on" spoke the Lieutenant into his comm.

		"Damn.  Now what the fuck am I supposed to do?" 
	Jack talked to himself in the net, surrounded by the 
	playing fields and game boards of the blue lit room.  "Wait.  
	Who took him out?"  He moved from board to board 
	checking all the different systems that were running, 
	personnel marks, timelines and on.  With a single 
	thought, twenty more boards came into play on the 
	ceiling above his head.  It was just like the feet of the 
	tables were nailed to the ceiling.  "Ah, I love tesseracts!" 
	Jack announced with a smile as he changed perspective 
	and jumped onto the ceiling to view the new playing 
	fields :  thermal and motion sensors of every floor in their 
	sector.  "Time for some fun!"

	By now the team had climbed down the elevator shaft ladder to 
within sight of the fourth subbasement.    Nemesis lead the way down 
with Donna, Slash and Aberdon following closely behind.  Their weapons 
slung and both hands holding onto the ladder, Nemesis pondered what an 
easy target they would be if anyone would open one of the doors and find 
them there.

	"Team this is God...God....God..." echoed one of the speakers in the 
shaft.  Slash looked around, trying to find the source without any luck.  

	"God, where are you!" Slash yelled, clinging onto the ladder, not 
allowing herself to look down.

	"I can't hear you, but I know where you are.  Keep going and 
hurry up.  One is dead so get out as soon as possible."

	"Shit!" screamed Slash.  The reality of the challenge was at hand.  
'Have we come this far only to be finished off.  Goddamn it.  I knew it was 
too big!' she thought to herself, as they descended closer to the elevator 
door.

	They reached subbasement 4 in no time and stopped to gather 
their weapons for an assault.  "Guys, we're one minute behind schedule.  
Since Nebulus is out, I say we just take out everything in our way and get 
out in the same manner" Nemesis said, looking back up the ladder.  'Nice 
ass, Donna.  We'll have to fuck when we get out of here.'

	"Let's do it!" snarled Slash.  'Pay back time.  Now the fun begins.'

	As the team climbed away from the door, Nemesis pulled out a 
magnetic explosive and secured it to the doors, sliding down the ladder in 
time for the doors to be completely destroyed.  Aberdon was the first into 
the hall.  The doors were shredded onto the floor nearby and the bodies 
of two guards lay among the scattered debris.  A quick look around and 
the shielded doors were closing quickly, locking the area out due to the 
explosion.  The team reassembled in the hall.

	"Team, this is God.  I can talk you through to the strike zone.  Go 
forward to the first door and I'll open it!" he ordered.  The team took off.  
Jack looked onto the master board for the sector, viewing what was going 
on.  "Enemy on other side, door opening now!" he yelled into the 
microphone next to him on the table.  The team crouched next to the 
walls as the door slid open.  Four guards were waiting just like Jack had 
said, and were soon disposed of by a sneak attack of needlers and hard 
ammo as the door opened.  They ran ahead down the hall, now lit by 
security lights.  The concrete walls and hard metal doors concealed labs 
and computer rooms by the dozens as they continued down the straight, 
tiled hallway.

	"Six guards commin' from the right hallway!" yelled Jack.  
Nemesis and the team slowed down and slid next to the facing wall of the 
hallway.  "Shutting blockade" said Jack as the solid metal shielding door 
fell into place, locking the guards out of range.  The group continued on.  

	Running towards the next intersection, Nemesis veered towards 
the left hallway.  They turned into the hallway, only to be stopped by a 
solid door, again.  Slash and Donna ran back a few steps, watching their 
backs.

	"God, we got a door" yelled Nemesis, knowing that he wouldn't be 
heard anyways.  

	"Incoming!" yelled Slash as a squad of commandos came down the 
hallway in full force.  Donna opened up and let out a spray of hard 
ammo, hitting a few, but having little effect.

	"Shit!  They're armored!" she yelled as the two men got in 
position.  Scraping fire bounced off the walls around Donna as she fell to 
the ground, trying to get out of the way of the action.

	"Now!" yelled Aberdon.  He and Nemesis ducked around the corner 
with their weapons, laying down fire.  The commandos taking cover 
against some of the walls that led into other hallways began putting 
down another layer of ammo at the two.  Donna jumped out a little to 
thrown down a flash mine.  She was nicked by two rounds in the chest 
and fell backward just as the mine exploded, sending up a high intensity 
flash explosion.  Slash jumped out just as it went off and fired two mini-
grenades which impacted directly above the cowering attackers.  
Aberdon and Nemesis took off down the hallway after the commando 
position and engaged themselves in the fight by firing at the 
commandos at point blank range.  Taking a few hits each, they pressed 
through the group until they were out of ammunition.  The smoke from 
the grenades had cleared and there were only a few more left.  Nemesis 
picked up the nearest one and slammed his fist into his face, crushing 
every bone from the impact.  The commando grabbed Nemesis' arm just 
as he was thrown into the wall behind him and forgotten about as 
Nemesis' attacked his next victim.  Soon the floor was littered with 
bloodied camouflage, their broken armor not strong enough against 
specialized armor piercing rounds.  Slash and Donna joined the two men 
in the middle of the battlefield.

	"Now this is what I call a fight!" yelled Nemesis allowing his 
adrenalizer to get the most of him.  

	"Military commandos.  Looks like we underestimated Cryon a little 
bit.  Let's move" said Slash, leading the team back to the door.  Reloads 
and armor checks were made.  Scrape marks in her armor were only left 
in Donna's chest where she was hit.

	"5:14:39" said Nemesis.

	"Team, God here.  Door opening in 2 seconds."

	"It's about goddamn time" hissed Aberdon.  The door slid upward 
surprising the group who was ready for anything now.  Another squad 
of commandos were lying on the ground, as if they had collapsed.  

	"Nerve gas is great isn't it" came Jack's voice over the speakers.

	"That boy's crazy" blurted Slash.  They relaxed their weapons 
enough to start running down the hallway towards the last blockade.  

	Jack watched intently at the movement of the team from within 
the computers.  "OK.  Alarms deactivated.  Explosives deactivated.  
Communications deactivated" he spoke to himself.  He constantly went 
over the area again and again in a split seconds making sure that 
nothing would go wrong once the team was in place.

	The last blockade was passed without any problems.  Labs with 
built in windows now lined the concrete substructure.  The halls were 
relatively dark, but shadows from the security night lights lined the 
walls.  

	"The lab should be up around the next corner" cautiously spoke 
Slash to Nemesis who was running side by side with her in the wide 
corridors.  Weapons pointed forward, they slowed to a brisk walk to 
within inches of the intersection that led to the target site.  'There's got 
to be a squad here' repeated Nemesis in his head.  'Come on, let's go, let's 
go!' anxiously thought Slash, ready to get the job over with.

	"Intruder is using armor piercers.  Stop them at all costs.  It's up 
to you, McGletspy" Lieutenant DeGrace's voice came over the military 
comm to the guards posted out front of the labs for Project Revolt.

	'Time to start the show' thought Nemesis to himself.  He pointed to 
his eyes while holding a flash mine in his fingers.  Everyone 
understood.  They took their positions around each other, ready for 
attack as Nemesis slid the flash mine smoothly across the floor in the 
direction of the target.  A second later, Nemesis' polarized CRI's viewed 
the four guards decked out in armored gear and heavy bore weapons as 
the flash mine went off, not too far from their position in front of the 
metal lab door.  Heavily armored in urban camouflage, Kevlar II body 
armor and carrying anti-terrorist attack gear, the four commandos 
opened fire immediately after the flash dimmed.  Their anti-radiation 
goggles protecting them from the burn of the mine allowed their 
weapons to pinpoint Nemesis' head in their sites, only to miss by his fast 
reflexes.

	"Four in armor!" yelled Nemesis over his shoulder while bringing 
his gun up for an assault.  The barrage silenced for a millisecond.  

	"Get back!" screamed Slash, pulling Donna with her.  A 
minigrenade exploded on the corner wall and was followed by three 
more that left more shrapnel than damaged concrete.

	"Hold this" said Aberdon shedding his equipment pack, 
containing some of the explosives.  "Let's do it!" he yelled, throwing two 
grenades into the hallway.  Right after impact, he and Nemesis began 
the attack by charging into the intersecting hallway to face the 
commandos head on.   Spraying needlers and hard ammo, the firing line 
pressed forward towards the commandos.  Without time to react from the 
grenade, the commandos began taking damage as the onslaught 
continued on.  Their armor being torn away from the ammunition, the 
guards soon fell to the ground without an escape route.  A quick release 
from one of the commandos launched a minigrenade at the line.  Moving 
out of its way, Aberdon and Nemesis lost position as the grenade exploded 
behind them.  Unsatisfied, however, Nemesis took control by directly 
attacking one of the commandos in close combat.  Weakened from the 
fire fight, the commando fought to gain balance as Nemesis picked him 
up off the ground by the throat, throwing his gun to the side for the 
challenge.  Kicking with his bloodied leg and grabbing with his hands, 
the commando fought until Nemesis slammed his fist into his face.  The 
anti-gas goggles exploded under the pressure.  The commando went limp 
in Nemesis' hands as he pulled his fist out of the commando's face, 
leaving only a crushed and bleeding lifeless body to slump to the ground 
with a release of his grip.  One other commando ran towards Nemesis, but 
was cut short as Aberdon gunned him down, finding weak points in the 
sides of his armor.  Nemesis reached down towards one of his kills of the 
day to get another weapon in time to head kill one of the other guards 
preparing to fire on Aberdon.  Weapons pointed at the head of the 
remaining one, Lieutenant McGletspy.

	Panting from the adrenaline rush, Nemesis lowered his barrel to 
walk closer to the Lieutenant.  The Lieutenant's leg and chest were 
bleeding from needlers.  He held his chest with his hand under his shirt, 
provocatively looking at the approaching Nemesis.

	"Eat me mother fucker!" yelled the Lieutenant, holding in his 
now exposed hand a death mine :  a high explosive that personnel carry 
for hopeless situations.  

	"Get out!" yelled Nemesis, running backwards and diving for the 
nearest intersecting hallway only a few steps away.  Aberdon let out a 
few rounds into the Lieutenant's skull but not in time to silence the 
mine.  A millisecond later, it erupted into a ball of fire, engulfing 
Aberdon.  A cloud of fire flew down the corridors, running over the rest 
of the party that had taken cover by kissing the ground.  The shockwave 
from the blast echoed its anger down the corridors until the fire itself 
had died away.  Slowly Nemesis pulled himself up off of the ground.  
Putting out a few fires that had started on his suit, he gradually made his 
way back to the battlefield.  

	Donna and Slash stood at the tip of a large blood pool.  Aberdon's 
body was now in six pieces, his extremities lying on the ground near 
him.  Blood stains and body parts cluttered the ceiling, walls and floor 
where the commandos had been.  All their bodies were now soaked, 
burning and scattered all about the hall.  Donna moved over to Nemesis 
and handed him her gun.

	"Gimme your K1 and let's get this over with" she softly spoke.  
Nemesis' large hand took hold of the grip and pointed it towards the 
facing locked door.  He let loose a minigrenade which exploded, 
destroying the locking mechanism on the door.  Donna turned back 
around towards the door only to be handed Nemesis' K1.

	The lab was lined with liquid beds and computer terminals with 
the large computer in the back.  The whole room was barely large 
enough to contain the ten beds.  The group got straight to work laying 
down the explosive packs and detonation arrays around the beds and 
supercomputer.

	"Sync check" said Nemesis as the last one was placed down.  
Donna took out the detonator and confirmed that they were all properly 
synced.

	"5:16:12.  Time to move" said Slash, exiting the room first.  Donna 
put on the last pack containing the party favors and left last, detonator 
in hand.  The trek back down the halls was fairly simple.  Their boots left 
a trail of bloodied bootprints from the last battle as they jogged down the 
hallways.  The thought of where was Jack was on everyone's mind since 
they had had no contact with him for the past few minutes.  A few more 
jogs to the left and right put them back at the stairwell.

	"5:16:49.  Let's do it" said Slash looking at Donna.  Nemesis went 
into the stairwell and proceeded to go up a flight and a half, checking 
for more guards.  Slash followed, but not as far since she was Donna's 
backup.  Donna was the last in and shut the door until only her hand 
with the detonator was sticking out, making sure that the structure 
would not interfere with the detonation.

	"Here we go!" she yelled up the stairs.  'Do it' she told herself as 
she pushed the trigger button down and pulled her arm in quickly.  
Donna began running upstairs as the explosions in the lab rocked the 
basement in a stunning blaze of fire and thunder.  Sonic blasts blew out 
many of the windows as it ran down the hallways only to be followed by 
clouds of fire that engulfed everything in site.  Multiple explosions could 
be distantly heard as the team regrouped on the third subbasement level 
and continued upward toward the main floor.

	"Watch it!" yelled Slash as they made their way to the bottom of 
the first floor's stairs.  An infrared antipersonnel mine was seen on the 
wall next to one of the bottom stairs.  A look skyward showed the 
explosive sitting, waiting for it's target to come through it's invisible 
trip line.  Carefully stepping over the trip line, Nemesis led the way to 
the top door.  'This is just too easy of an escape' he thought to himself 
remembering many other raids whose exit was much tougher than it's 
entrance.  He unfastened two grenades from his armor and proceeded to 
throw them into the hallway, shutting the stairwell door quickly behind 
them.  

	"Grenade!!!" yelled a guard from inside the hallway.  Nemesis' 
guess was right.  The two exploded relatively at the same time.  Nemesis 
quickly entered the smoky hallway and proceeded to fire at the four 
commandos who had taken posts on opposite sides of the stairwell door.  
Slash and Donna soon jumped into the hallway, taking posts on either 
side of Nemesis, guarding against additional intrusion.  A few quick looks 
around only produced the four dead bodies on the ground.  Nemesis 
reloaded.

	The party turned right from the stairwell door and proceeded 
with caution to the next intersection.  They moved slowly with their 
weapons pointed straight ahead, searching for the way out while still 
knowing that they had to return to the original entrance to not only get 
out, but to also find out what happened to Nebulus.  The first intersection 
was clear.

	"Donna.  String a mine across here" ordered Nemesis who 
continued to move on.  Donna handed the mine to Slash who plastered it 
to the opposing wall while Donna strung the device across the 
intersection.  

	The lights began to flicker on and off.  Then the siren was heard.  
The team stopped to look around.  The electronic whirring of the fire 
alarm filled the entire hallway with its annoying tone.  "Code 1 fire alert 
in subbasement 4.  All personnel must evacuate these premises 
immediately" spoke a recorded voice from the speakers that Jack had 
been using previously.  'Why the hell are the alarms going off if Jack 
had control of the situation?' questioned Nemesis.

	"Jack must be out as well" said Slash.  "Let's get the fuck out of 
here!"  The team took off down the hallway.  It was time to leave Cryon 
once and for all.  The operation had taken long enough.  Half of the team 
was either dead or taken out of the picture somehow.   

	"Donna.  Give me your gun and start preparing some party 
favors" yelled Slash taking Donna's gun.  Donna took off her pack and 
sorted through the explosives and grenades, ready to hand them out 
when people needed to die.  Passing another intersection, the team saw 
the back of the chair at the security desk.  Nemesis waved his hand back 
at Donna and she put in it a high explosive, enough of a bang to destroy 
the room.

	"Hey man, catch!" yelled Nemesis.  Nebulus turned around only to 
see the explosive heading his way.  The guards hiding behind the walls 
still had their guns pointed at him if he screwed up.  But then, what else 
could he do.  The team stopped their advance and Nemesis shot two 
minigrenades into the room.  Nebulus jumped from his chair and 
sprinted towards his team as the grenades went off and the explosive 
landed on the chair.  The team took cover just as gun fire was heard, but 
was soon silenced by the deadening thunder of the explosive as it 
completely destroyed everything and everyone in the room.

	"Glad you still know what you're doin'" said Nebulus looking at 
the team.

	"We figured something was up, so I decided to make sure no one 
was in the room" replied Nemesis.  

	"There may be more guards down the hallway."

	"Let's go."  Getting up once again, the team continued down the 
hall and fought through the fire and debris of the security room.  
Finally advancing down the final hall, Nemesis emptied his gun of 
minigrenades and destroyed the entrance door and hopefully 
everything else that could attack them.  Donna dropped off the party 
favors and they carefully exited the docking entrance.  Nemesis was first 
away from the entrance and proceeded to move aside the manhole cover.  
The group got into the hole and Donna, being last as usual, pressed the 
detonator, igniting the explosives left in the pack.  The docking area of 
the building erupted in fire and exploded sending debris everywhere.  
But, the team had already begun the trip through the sewers.  The job 
was over.  It was time to go home.

	Sitting in the van on the way back into the city, no one talked.  
The van took a corner and drove by the Cryon building, getting a good 
look at all the police and fire department personnel who were attacking 
the multiple fires in the building.  The deep color of fire offset the light 
grayish color building in the morning light.  The sun had just started to 
come up, but was still pretty early before daybreak.  They soon turned 
into the city, taking their masks off.




			Cool Darkness

		Chapter 5 : A Thorn in Paradise



	"So what the hell happened in there?" questioned Nemesis 
looking towards the front of the van in Nebulus' direction.

	"I was watching you more than I was watching myself" told a 
disgusted Nebulus, completely shamed by his performance or lack there 
of.

	"At least you know a sign when you see one.  What happened to 
Jack?"

	"What do you mean, what happened to Jack" rudely snapped 
Nebulus who turned around to give Nemesis the evil eye.

	"We lost him before we got to the strike zone.  Where'd he go?  I 
thought he was supposed to follow us all the way out."

	"I don't know.  Maybe he bumped into ICE or something.  Why 
don't we get back there quickly and find out" Nebulus pointed out to 
Donna who pushed her foot into the floor, accelerating the van as she 
drove on into the city.

	Not soon enough for Nebulus' liking, the van pulled in front of 
the garage door of the warehouse.  Nemesis calmly hopped out of the 
back door of the van and proceeded to open the door.  The van came to a 
quiet stop with the garage door crashing down behind it.  The lights 
were still on; the office door to the underground comps was still shut.

	"Jack!  Hey Jack!  Where the hell are you shit-head!?" yelled 
Nemesis, feeling a little funny about the whole situation.  Walking to the 
back of the van, he picked up his rifle and proceeded to walk towards the 
office door.  He was followed by Nebulus and eventually Slash, who had 
had enough of Jack's clowning around.  Screwing around on the nets is 
one thing, but leaving a team in the thick of a job is another.  

	They approached the office door and found it still locked from the 
inside.  Nebulus walked over to a nearby desk, reached into the top 
drawer and picked up a magnetic key.  He returned to the door and 
inserted the flat key into the slot just under the door handle which 
produced a soft pop as the lock disengaged.  Nebulus opened the door and 
the group peered in.  The office was still the same :  a few file cabinets, a 
metal desk with a wooden, rocking office chair, a single light at the desk 
with another one in the ceiling, and a small hand comp sitting at the 
right of the desk.

	'Nothing is missing.  Everything is cool...except' thought Nebulus.  
"Jack's gone."

	"What!?" wined Nemesis in disbelief of wherever Nebulus had 
derived this idea.

	"The chair's here.  He should be sitting in it down in the room" 
stated Nebulus loosing his cool.

	"Bullshit.  He and I changed that last week 'cause he wanted a 
padded chair so his butt wouldn't hurt so much" slapped Nemesis.

	"Huh!?!?" 

	"Come on" said Nemesis entering the room and pressing the 
correct sequence of keys on the hand comp to enable the elevator to the 
comp room.  Slash moved the chair out of the way as the plate under the 
leg area of the desk slowly began its decent into the comp room.  Within 
10 seconds it had hit bottom, about 12 feet below in the concrete dungeon 
where Jack roamed.

	"Jack.  Hey, Jack..you down there!?" yelled Slash.  No answer.

	"He's probably still in the nets.  He'll never respond like that" 
spoke Nebulus.

	"Well there's only one way to find out" said Nemesis as he hang 
dropped from the desk edge into the dark pit.

	"Don...hunnn....you moron" Slash sighed under her breath.  'He 
never thinks about traps.'  "Watch out for traps."  Nemesis never heard 
her voice; his concentration on where he was and not what people were 
doing topside.  He pivoted left in the direction of the comp room.  The 
corridor to the room was normal sized with a low ceiling.  The walls were 
made of cold concrete that still flaked grit when rubbed against.  It was 
dark with a few streaks of light coming from the room, barely lighting 
enough for someone to see.  Nemesis changed his eyes to night vision to 
see that was up with Jack.

	'All right Jack, where the hell are you man.'  He peered into the 
comp room.  The two main comps on the far wall were humming as usual, 
the short ceiling making them look larger than normal.  He walked 
further into the room.  The four workstations were still running with 
their monitors running lines of info across them constantly.  'Jack.  
Where the hell are you.'  He lowered his rifle.  In fact he lowered it until 
the barrel almost scraped the ground.  He stood completely erect and 
walked over to the wall where the control panel was.  A single touch and 
a second panel came up.  He closed his eyes as he turned the ceiling light 
on.  His eyes were switched back to normal vision and he opened his 
eyelids.

	"Come on down, guys!" yelled Nemesis as he looked over at Jack 
who was still slouched in his padded chair, still jacked into the nets.

	"What's the deal!?" yelled back Slash.

	"He's here.  Still in the net."  The elevator platform began to move 
back up and in no time the rest of the team minus Donna was in the comp 
room.  "I guess he's still in the net."

	"What the hell's he still doin' in there?" replied Slash quite 
disgusted at Jack now that he was still here and had left them in Cryon.

	"He must've run into something." sighed Nebulus looking at his 
foot as it tapped lightly on the concrete floor.  'What could he have run 
into?  ICE?  Naw, couldn't be.  He's too good for that.  Then again...  Naw, 
he must be screwin' around or somethin'.  But why would he leave us in 
Cryon to go screw around somewhere?  I wonder if they got this thing up 
and running before we got there.  Or what if they had another site, or if 
we attacked the wrong site!  Couldn't be.  We planned this thing to 
perfectly to hit the wrong site.  Yeah, sure.' he thought to himself, 
especially after how badly they fucked the whole deal up.  'Well, there's 
only one way to find out.'  Looking up he said "I'm goin' in" and started to 
walk towards the workstation next to Jack's.

	"What!  You can't be serious.  Let's just pull the plug and get him 
back" screeched Slash.

	"Yeah, right.  And possibly loose him forever.  He might be into 
something serious, and there's only one way to find out." replied 
Nebulus, putting a wireless jack next to his ports.

	"I thought you could track someone like that for cryin' out loud!"

	"We'll see about that."  With that he sat in the chair and jacked in, 
wireless of course.

	"Well, let's get them prepared for a long trip.  I can't see them 
coming back any time soon" softly spoke Slash.  She and Nemesis turned 
to the one cabinet that had little components and things in it.  The door 
was opened and two IV's were taken out by Slash.  She walked over to the 
two and began to get Jack ready for insertion.  Nemesis in the mean time 
began preparing the two nutrient bags.  In no time, both Jack and 
Nebulus were outfitted with medical nutrient bags that fed into their 
system.  That way they at least wouldn't dehydrate.

		Nebulus stood up from a kneeling position on the 
	asphalt street of an unknown city.  It was dark, actually 
	gray in color and the clouds in the sky were moving very 
	fast.  The surrounding buildings stood like monuments 
	compared to Nebulus' small body.  A little piece of 
	newspaper skipped by along the ground behind his feet.  
	The long street he was looking down seemed to go on 
	forever.  The city was completely deserted.  
	
		"Strange" he told himself outloud.  "Oh, well, let's 
	get going."  He began walking in the direction of the first 
	gate to get into mainstream cyberspace.  A few steps and 
	he leaned forward to the ground and shape changed into a 
	sleek black sports car, one of the new European cars that 
	can top 300 mph.  Fat tires, no rear view mirrors; kinda 
	like an old Countach he thought to himself as he squealed 
	his tires and flew down the streets.  

		"Great.  Traffic jam already."  In the near distance 
	he could see lots of people trying to get into the gateway.  
	"Always a bunch of jerks who don't know there way 
	around the block yet."  With a glance skyward, he pulled 
	off the ground and moved a story or two above the rest of 
	the traffic.  Flying over the crown was fun.  The first 
	gateway was breached easily and he soon got back onto 
	the road and cruised into the highways, the internet 
	highways that connected to everywhere in the world, and 
	then some.

		After only a little time, his speed began to slow.  
	Actually he began to slow immensely, eventually coming 
	to a complete stop.  'What the hell is going on?' he thought 
	to himself, checking all of his systems.  Then he began to 
	shape change back into a person, except he hadn't chosen 
	to do so.  'Somebody's taking control of my environment.'  
	Then he began to fly backwards, completely out of 
	control.  He fought to stabilize and he tried to stop, but 
	eventually was thrown back into the crowd of people 
	waiting at the gateway entrance.  With an additional 
	thrust, he was tossed into the crowd, landing on the hard 
	asphalt just like everyone else had.

		"What the hell is going on!" he yelled at the top of 
	his lungs as he stood up, wiping himself off.  The area 
	around he began to change and soon he was standing on a 
	computer generated grid.  No streets.  No buildings.  Just 
	grids.  He continued to look around, finally running his 
	identifier program.  In a few seconds an arrow appeared 
	pointing in the direction off to his right, toward the 
	gateway.  He started to push his way in that direction, 
	searching for Jack.  The gateway soon became clearer to 
	him as it was a large billboard sign which read :


		The Cyberspace Mob now rules the nets	

		    Pay to Enter.  Pay at your OWN Risk


		"What the hell is going on, here!" he yelled.

		"Oh shut up up there you asshole!" came from 
	someone behind him.  He turned around to see who the 
	hell was yelling at him in a crisis like this.

		"Fuck you buddy!" he yelled back, not knowing 
	who had yelled at him.  He continued to push his way 
	towards the front.  Eventually he got within a few 
	hundred feet of the gateway and recognized Jack only a 
	few steps in front of him.

		"Jack, what the hell is going on here man!?" asked 
	Nebulus as he reached his companion.

		"What the hell are you doing here?  I thought you 
	were still in Cryon."
	
		"I was.  We got back already.  What the hell 
	happened to you?"

		'Take a look.  One second I was in, the next I was 
	pulled out by these guys.  Do you believe this shit.  They've 
	taken over all the surrounding gateways and there's no 
	way in or out to another gateway."

		"What do you mean.  You can't even break it?"
	
		"No one can" explained Jack in a sorrowful tone of 
	voice.  "I've found a few friends here and they can't break 
	it.  Whoever made this isn't working for the government, 
	military or a company.  This is straight from the 
	underground.  All I can figure is that it's written in a new 
	AI language that actually learns who you are and how to 
	keep you from getting into the gateway if you haven't 
	paid."

		"You mean to tell me that someone is holding the 
	gateway hostage?"

		"Yep.  The funny part is that no one has any idea 
	who could've pulled a stunt like this off.  This is beyond 
	professional.  I can't even tell where it's coming from."  
	The two stood around almost as lost as everyone else.  It 
	was getting more crowded as time went on and eventually, 
	Nebulus had had enough.

		"Get a site set up so we can start attacking this 
	thing from the inside out."

		"Yeah right" replied Jack completely disgusted 
	now.  "Don't you think I've tried it already in about a 
	thousand configurations, only to get tossed back without 
	getting any further into the system.  I told you once you 
	moron, the more you do the more it understands about 
	you, which means that it can stop you easier every time 
	you try something new."

		"So how do we get the fuck through" blazed a 
	beyond frustrated Nebulus.

	"So what should we do now?" asked Nemesis, peering towards the 
elevator.  After standing there for ten minutes, his patience had run out 
and a bar run was the first thing that ran into his head.  "I know.  How 
about some Black Oil?"

	"That dump.  Naw, I'm not in the mood" casually replied Slash.  

	"How about Hot Kicks" she said with a sly grin growing on her face as 
she looked into Nemesis' eyes.

	"You gotta be kiddin' me.  We don't fit into a place like that."

	"That doesn't keep you from screwin' every chic with big tits, 
long legs, and stockings pulled up to her crotch that works there now 
does it?" she kidded pulling him towards the elevator.

	"Jealous?" he asked with a smirk.

	"I'm coming in my pants just thinking about you" she joked as 
they stood on the elevator platform.  She pressed her hand against the 
wall where a hidden panel was and the platform began to rise.  

	Topside, they walked out of the office to find Donna sitting in one 
of the office chairs in front of a desk off to the side of the warehouse.

	"Everything OK with Jack?"

	"Who knows.  Nebulus went into the matrix to fetch him" replied 
Slash.  "Hey.  We're gonna go to a bar.  Wanna come?"

	"Sure.  But first, where's my money?" she said getting back down 
to business.

	"Nebulus handles that and he is preoccupied right now."  Donna 
wasn't too pleased about this.  In fact she was getting quite pissed off as 
she stood up to face Slash.  "Chill woman.  It's not like we're gonna forget 
you.  Jeez."

	"Hey.  A job is a job.  Now it's done and I want my money!"

	"Look honey, you ain't gonna get paid until he gets out of the nets 
so why don't you just pack that bitchy attitude of yours away and chill 
out until he is free.  This job ain't done until we're all back and we got 
two in the nets!"  snarled Slash, frowning her brow.

	Nemesis looked on at the 'cat fight' as he called it between the 
two.  'Wait a minute.'  He looked at Donna's forehead.  'Zoom in.  More.  
There.  Now look at that.  Sweat.  And it's not even hot here, either.'  He 
moved his gaze down to her hands.  'Same thing, and even a little 
twitchy.'  He panned back up to her chest which was expanding and 
contracting a little faster and larger than he would've expected.  He 
switched his eyes to IR, trying to get a thermal scan of her body.  To no 
avail, the combat suit that she still wore blocked most of the signals 
coming from her body and canceled his experiment.

	"All right.  Chill out.  Why don't you take a shower and get 
changed and I will pull Nebulus out in time for him to pay you.  Then we 
can go to the bars.  OK?" stated Nemesis.

	"Where the hell am I gonna..."

	"There's a shower in the bathroom over there" he said pointing to 
a door along the office wall, "and your extra clothes that you brought are 
still in the van, right?"

	"Don't EVEN think about pullin' somethin' stupid, Nemesis" she 
warned with a glare.  Nemesis didn't move and didn't loose eye contact 
until she turned around to get her stuff out of the van.  Slash took his 
arm and turned him to fact her.

	"What the fuck do you think you're doing?" she scowled in a low 
voice.

	"Trust me."

		By now, Jack and Nebulus had jumped in and out of 
	cyberspace at least a dozen times, trying to trick the 
	gateway or get past it somehow.  Each time they would 
	bring in different attack programs and loose them just as 
	quickly as the 'Cyberspace Mob' would find them and 
	erase them, or make them unusable.  There were now 
	about five people in a group around Jack and Nemesis; all 
	of whom knew each other through one facet or another. 

		"So where do we go from here?" sighed one of the 
	guys.

		"We have to find another way around it.  
	Everything we've tried has failed.  Period.  And I can't see 
	any way around it" said Jack.

		"So the cybermaster Jack has finally met his 
	match.  How interesting" stated Nebulus, getting more 
	excited at the prospect of what seemed like the ultimate 
	challenge.

		"I wouldn't say that so soon.  It's just going to take 
	some time to figure out how to get around it" replied Jack, 
	letting the comment fly over his head.

		"So where are we?" asked one of Jack's friends.

		"Simple.  We can't get past without paying, which 
	is completely absurd.  We know it's not being done by the 
	government, military, a company, Mogul, Nestroth and a 
	few other groups.  But that leaves a lot of names that, 
	although I can't figure who could've masterminded this, 
	could be responsible for it" stated Jack.

		Someone else spoke up.  "Well, attack and defense 
	programs don't work.  It can tell who we are and seems to 
	know our strengths and weaknesses.  Camouflaging 
	doesn't help since it kills that first.  I don't think if we 
	sent ICE against it it would even work."

		"What!  Are you nuts.  How the hell would you SEND 
	ICE after it.  There's nowhere to keep it connected to to 
	run it" heckled another.

		"Yes there is and that's exactly what we're gonna 
	do" spoke Jack, standing up and pacing around in a very 
	small circle.  "We can attach it to the gateway itself.  It's 
	identifier must still exist or we couldn't have gotten here."

		"Yeah, but it'll already know how to kill ICE."

		"Yeah, but I know a way to make it so they can't 
	track it or disarm it" ecstatically spoke Jack.  "Everyone 
	jump out and meet me at my comp room in 1 hour."

	Donna came out of the bathroom wearing a short mini with tights 
underneath it, highlighting her legs with black spandex.  Her wet hair 
left trickles of water on her leather short jacket that covered a tank top.  

	'Switch to IR.  Focus and zoom on chest area.  Just as I thought.'  
"You definitely look sexy tonight, woman" yelled Nemesis from across 
the warehouse.  He hopped off the desk he was sitting on and approached 
her.

	"So where's Nebulus with my money, macho man?" she said with 
a smirk in her smile.

	"This way, my lady" he said, raising his left hand, palm up, to take 
hers as a rightful gentleman should.  She placed her right hand in his 
with a flirtatious smile.  He slowly started to turn around and Donna 
began to take a step forward to accompany him.  

	Quickly, Nemesis spun back in her direction, landing a bone-
breaking fist in her stomach.  Instantaneously, she fell to the ground as 
if life had been sucked out of her.  She laid on the ground in a fetal 
position, holding her stomach, completely unable to breath from the 
attack.  Nemesis looking over to Slash who was sitting at a desk, giving 
her the signal.  She rose from her chair carrying a needle.  Nemesis 
reached down and gripped Donna's jacket firmly by the shoulders and 
ripped it down her arms so that they were bare from her shoulder to her 
elbow.  She winced in pain, still unable to breath.  Nemesis reached his 
hand up and received the needle from Slash.

	"Nighty night, my little spy" cooed Nemesis with a devil's grin, as 
he injected her with the tranquilizer.

	"Nighty night, bitch" spit Slash.

			Chapter 6 : A Slap in the Face



	"Whew.  Man oh man.  This one's gonna hurt" said a sweaty 
Jack as he faced his sidearm, Nebulus.  He stood up and staggered 
over to the bathroom stall that was on the other side of the 
elevator to relieve himself.  Nebulus just sat there rubbing his 
eyes.  After a few seconds he stood and walked over to the elevator 
platform and momentarily waited for the chair to come down.

	"Where the hell you goin'?" yelled Jack from the stall.

	"I'm gonna check on the others and tell them what's up.  
We're gonna need some info from the streets and fast ...." he 
trailed off in his own thought as the chair arrived.  He sat down 
and got to the office floor in no time, listening to Jack rant and 
rave about what he had just said.  Nebulus' brow was furrowed, 
now, and time had taken it's toll on him.  He walked out of the 
office to notice the van was missing.  "Goddamn, stupid son's of 
bitches!" he yelled, spinning around to look at the whole 
warehouse.  "Those dumn fuck's!  If it's the last thing I told them 
it's to stay put!  Jesus!" he fumed slamming a fist into the desk he 
began to sit at.  A thousand swear words ran through his mind 
and his head began to throb.  Closing his eyes, he sat back in the 
hard wood chair thinking about the job, running his fingers 
through his hair.  'Of course, we first had to fuck the job up.  
Then we actually had to run into this damn mob.  Who the hell 
would dare to be a mob on the nets.  Who would have the 
capabilities.  Hmmmmm.  "The government" his eyes flashed 
open.  "Nah.  Couldn't be" he said to himself with a quirky smile 
that almost gleamed with getting the answer, and then laughed at 
it's stupidity.  "But it would be the perfect front to run us 
down....legally.  Well, kind of.  Shit."

	He opened the top desk drawer and took out a few plastic 
bottles of pills.  He popped a few in his mouth and downed them 
with a flat can of Coke that had probably been there more than a 
day.  

	"What's the matter with you!" yelled Jack from the office's 
entrance.  "How many times have I told you not to get drugged 
before you jack in.  Especially now.  What the hell do you ..."

	"Oh shut up and take this!" said Nebulus throwing a bottle 
to Jack.  He caught it with a rattle and looked up very disgusted 
almost in disbelief at what Nebulus was implying.  "Relax, it's 
caffeine.  It'll wake you up."

	"I'm not tired" replied Jack walking towards Nebulus.  He 
screwed the cap off the bottle and put a pill in his mouth.  He 
reached the table, putting the closed bottle down and picking up 
the can of Coke.

	"That's been there awhile, you know" muttered Nebulus.

	"I know.  I opened it last week" he said with a smirk.

*************

	Slash had been driving the van through the back streets of 
the city for about ten minutes until she came to the designated 
spot Nemesis had told her to go to.  The tall buildings surrounding 
them sent shadows out to swallow up the surrounding sidewalks, 
almost requiring a street lights to light up the broken and 
graffittied walls that surrounded them.  

	"So where the hell do we go from here?" she asked, leaning 
over her shoulder to get a glimpse of Nemesis' back.  He was 
leaning over Donna who was still out cold.  Her arms were tied 
together with unbreakable plastic ties that were laced from her 
wrists up to her elbows.  Her hands had turned pale from lack of 
blood in her hands.  Her legs were tied in a similar manner, one 
that Nemesis found a certain liking to.

	"There should be a garage door around here somewhere 
that has the word 'Ixzer' graffettied on it in red" replied Nemesis 
who had turned to look out the front windshield.  "Just go slow 
and we should  be able to see it better."

	"I can't see a goddamn thing with Ixzer on it" whined 
Slash, getting quite frustrated with the whole secretive situation.  
'First you don't tell me where we're going, then what we're doing.  
You dumb shit!  I don't see why I ever listen to you.'  She slowly 
eased her foot on the accelerator and let the van drift down the 
alleyway, nearly scraping the sides of it on one of the buildings.

	"Stop here.  Turn the engine off" spoke Nemesis in a 
hushed voice as he popped the sliding door open and slowly 
began to push it out of his way.

	"What's the silence for man?  I don't see any Ixzer."

	Without a reply, he jumped out of the van, landing his 
combat boots on the broken asphalt and turned around to scoop 
up the still unconscious Donna.  Throwing her over his shoulder, 
he walked in front of the van and stood in front of the garage 
door.  Slash got out and stood behind him still unsure of what was 
about to happen.  'Switch to UV.'  Ixzer appeared on the door, just 
as he had said.  He slowly moved to the wall on the left side of the 
door and allowed Donna to slide from his shoulder, landing 
soundly on the concrete with a thud.

	"Well I see we're in a good mood today" smirked Slash 
getting a kick out of Nemesis' behavior.  'He's finally back to his 
old self' she smiled to herself, looking down at Donna.  'Bitch.'  
Her smile was broken as the wall Nemesis was touching broke 
open and a small camera appeared in front of his face.  She took a 
step back, getting into a combat stance.  Her claws extended 
instantly.  He never moved.

	"Enter password" stated a speaker originating from near 
the camera.

	"Zephia 12 Luther Mia" replied Nemesis.  The camera 
disappeared as the wall rebuilt itself, hiding the broken area.  A 
couple of loud noises came from within the garage and the door 
slowly began to open.  Nemesis bent over and scooped up Donna's 
body and began walking into the garage.  Slash followed a little 
hesitantly behind her companion, still with her claws out and 
ready.  She really hated being uninformed.

	"Stop right there!" came a deep, husky male voice from 
within the darkness of the garage.  The two of them had barely 
gotten ten feet within the building.  

	"Who's there!" yelled Slash from behind her companion.

	"Nemesis.  How's it goin' mon?"

	"Not too bad Doc.  Got a little present for you."

	"Another hooker.  Don't you know I gave them up for 
lent?"

	"No hookers this time.  A tinker toy to take apart."

	By now, Slash was completely confused.  'What the hell is 
going on?  How is this guy and where the hell is he?' she thought 
trying to look into the darkness.

	"Do we get to have some fun this time?"

	"You got it."

	"Bring her in."  The lights flashed on, slightly blinding 
Slash for a second.  The garage door immediately slammed down 
into the concrete that startled the always calm Slash.

	"Will someone please tell me what the fuck is going on!" 
yelled Slash at the top of her lungs.  Nemesis turned around 
slowly eyeing her weirdly.

	"Slash, meet Doc.  He's a techie friend of mine.  He likes to 
take things apart and see how they work."  He turned towards Doc 
and began walking in his general direction.  "Doc, this is my 
friend Slash.  She's with Nestroth" he said pointing a thumb in 
her direction.  

	"Hey ya sexy" he said looking her over.  She looked him 
over back.  He stood almost as tall as Nemesis, but had black hair 
down to the middle of his back that flowed as he turned around to 
lead Nemesis to the door behind him.  He walked with a limp to the 
left side and had a cybernetic left arm as well.  'He must've gotten 
into something' thought Slash to herself as she began to follow 
the two men towards the door, her claws finally retracting.  It 
was unlocked with a pass card and led to a set of stairs leading 
downward.  Doc led them down.  Nemesis bumped Donna's head on 
the door frame.  Slash just had to let out a small laugh at that.

	They arrived at a another door that lead into a cybernetics 
lab, or something that looked like one.  Donna was placed on the 
medical table in the middle of the room.  There were tools of all 
sorts lining the walls and hanging from the ceiling.  Off to the 
left side were large tools for more heavy equipment, including 
what looked like a modified military gatlin gun.

	"I take it you like weaponry, sweetie?" smirked Doc seeing 
Slash look the gun over.  She looked at him with an anticipated 
smile that said yes.  "Hmm.  Maybe I'll let you take her for a ride 
tonight."  He turned towards Nemesis who was cutting Donna's 
bonds with one of Doc's molecularly sharp blades.

	"So what the hell's with this chic anyways?" asked Doc.

	"She worked with us on our last project, but she's got 
something in her chest that I think is a bug.  It's the only thing 
that explains why we ran into shit."

	"How do you know?"

	"Look at her under IR.  You'll see something really black 
there."

	"So you want to cut her open and see what we can see?"

	"Let's see if she will talk first."  The two men took her arms 
and legs, cuffing them to the four corners of the table securely.  
Doc took out an antidote for the sleeping chemical Nemesis used 
on her, and injected her with it.  In a few moments she came to 
trying to wipe her eyes with no luck from the restraints.  She 
looked up to see Nemesis looking right into her face.  Doc was 
busy putting on a surgeon's hat, mask and gloves.  'Interesting 
difference from the mechanics suit there Doc' Slash told herself 
as she too walked towards Donna.

	"Who are you working for Donna?" asked Nemesis in a 
very calm voice.

	"What the hell are you doing?  Untie me at once, you 
moron!" she screamed back testing her restraints.

	"I don't think so sweetie.  I think you set us up, which is 
why you've got a bug in your chest.  So why don't you just tell us 
what is going on" he said politely.

	"I'm not working for anyone.  And I don't have anything 
in my chest you, idiot!  Now let me go!" she screamed.  Doc walked 
around and attached two electrodes to her head and turned on a 
scanner that monitored certain parts of the brain for 
brainwaves.  "What the hell is that?  Who is he?"

	"Donna, I'm only going to ask you one more time, before I 
cut your chest open and find out what the hell you have in there.  
Now, tell me, who are you working for" he said in a very deep 
voice that began to frighten Donna even more.  His frowned brow 
made her look at him with wide eyes, fearing that he was serious.  
She thought for a moment, and then just made her eyelids very 
narrow and matched his frown with hers.

	"Fuck off bastard" she replied in a low tone.  Nemesis bent 
down until his face was less than a centimeter away from hers 
without changing his expression.

	"Have it your way, my dear."  He moved his lips down to 
hers and gave her a small kiss on the lips.  She didn't kiss him 
back.  He withdrew his face from hers, standing straight up, and 
removed the electrodes from her head.  "We won't be needing 
these" he said tossing them to Doc.  He looked back down at Donna 
and saw the fear in her eyes, yet also saw her determination as 
well.  He moved his right hand up to his left shoulder and quickly 
sent it flying across Donna's face, slapping her cheek so that the 
side of her face bounced off the table.  Blood began to trickle 
from the corner of her mouth as she turned to glare back at 
Nemesis whose facial expression still had not changed.

	"You asshole.  I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch!" she 
screamed.  Starting to violently pull on her restraints, she yelled 
and screamed until Doc had had enough.

	"Time to put her to sleep, I think."

	"Not this time.  I want her to feel this" snarled Nemesis.  
Donna barely caught what he said and gasped a little in 
anticipation.  Nemesis nodded to Slash who was getting a kick out 
of the torture being induced by Nemesis.  'It's good to have him 
back' she thought to herself.  She walked to Donna's right side 
and smiled at her.  Donna only caught a glimpse of her out of her 
peripheral vision.  Stroking her stomach, Slash began feeling 
Donna's lower ribs and stomach.  Then raised her strong arm and 
let the side of her fist slam into Donna's stomach, just below her 
sternum.  Donna sucked in her breath and pulled at her cuffs as 
her face turned red from her breath being knocked of out her.  
She finally relaxed a little and began taking short breaths.

	Nemesis stood above her head still and pulled her jacket 
away as much as possible from her chest.  He then reached into 
her top and in one swift pull, ripped the top of it and her bra 
open.  She struggled underneath him to no evail as his hands 
went further down to grab the divided material at the edge of the 
tear.  In another pull, her top was in two and he pulled the parts 
to the sides to reveal her bare chest and white breasts.  Her 
nipples were slightly hard from her treatment, something that 
Slash took note of.  She slowly caressed both of Donna's breasts, 
allowing her touch to become rougher as her claws extended a 
few inches from her fingertips.  Her slight smile of playfulness 
changed to a devilish grin as she moved her fingers to the 
underside of Donna's breasts and pushed her claws into the skin 
below them.  Not wanting to be outdone by what was sure to be 
effective torture by Nemesis, Slash began to drag her claws down 
towards Donna's navel.

	"Now who are you working for Donna?" asked Slash now 
enjoying the fun as well.

	"Nobody!  I swear I'm not working for anybody!" she 
screamed.  Tears were now running from her eyes as she tossed 
her head from side to side.  Slash only pushed in harder until 
blood coated much of her lower stomach.

	'I've had enough of this shit' thought Nemesis as he 
reached over for the molecularly sharp blade he had cut her 
bonds with.  He placed the edge of it next to the tendon in her 
right peck.  Slash reluctantly pulled her claws out of Donna as 
she saw what Nemesis was about to do.  "Donna, why did you set us 
up.  Tell me or you will regret it" he spoke in a stern voice after 
waiting impatiently for an answer.

	"Go to hell!" she yelled.  The pain and realization of the 
situation, finally breaking her.

	"Fine.  Slash put a gag in her mouth.  I don't want any of 
her childish screams to hurt my ears"  he said.  Slash complied by 
stuffing a dirty rag in her mouth and stepped back as Nemesis 
began slowly cutting the tendon in her peck.  Her screams were 
muffled by the rag, but her tears and struggling movements only 
made the pain worse.  The tendon finally broken and Donna let 
out a ear-piercing shriek as the tears rolled down her face freely.

	"That's enough, Nemesis" said Doc as he came over to 
Nemesis who was getting ready to start on the other shoulder.  He 
placed the end of a silver device that looked like a gun to Donna's 
throat and pulled the trigger.  She jerked and then collapsed to 
the table, unconscious.  

	"Making her squirm is not going to get the info you want 
man."

	"You know how much I hate people who stab me in the 
back."

	"Let's just get what you came for and forget about it, all 
right?" spoke Doc in a soft tone of voice, a little shocked by the 
whole situation.

	"You're the doc.  Let's see what's in her chest."  He removed 
the blade from her shoulder and stepped back as Doc began to 
stop the bleeding in Donna's stomach with a laserstitch.  After 
removing the gag in her mouth, he began working on stopping 
the extensive bleeding from her shoulder.  To Nemesis' wishes, he 
finally cut into her chest with a scalpel.  Doc brought over a few 
instruments to determine just where and what the black box in 
her chest really was, then began to go after the prize.

	"Jesus Christ!  This thing is really in her.  Someone really 
did a good job on her when they put it in."  Doc continued to try 
and get a better look at the black thin box that was lodged under 
Donna's sternum, near her collar bone.  "How the hell could she 
breath for cryin' out load?"  The frown on Doc's face spelled a 
tough job, and probably one done by a pro.  He continued to open 
her up enough to get at the box and finally cut the thin metal 
rings that were securing it to her sternum.  A soft digital pulse 
emanated from Donna's direction, and then a hushed pop silenced 
all sound in the room.  Her head and body jerked slightly and 
then went limp again.  Her heart drastically slowed until coming 
to a complete stop within seconds of the diminished sound.

	"Damn" softly stated Doc, keeping his hands still.

	"What?" questioned Slash and Nemesis almost in unison.

	"Shoulda known.  Oh well.  Let's see what we can see."  He 
slowly pulled the box out from under Donna's sternum, not 
bothering to put her back together more than letting the torn 
skin slide back into place.  Taking the box over to the sink, he 
removed most of the blood from the box with a damp towel and put 
it under a lamp to get a better look at it.  'Edging at the sides, not 
too tough.  No markings, no noticeable points, oh hey, there's the 
trigger mechanism' he thought looking at a very small silver 
line down the inside of the clips.  Nemesis and Slash becoming 
bored with the subject at hand, retired to opposite sides of the 
room to lean on the walls, waiting for something to come out of 
the box that would give them a clue to Donna's true loyalties.

	Doc picked the box up and moved it over to the work table 
and placed it on a ceramic flat plate that was situated under one of 
his analyzers.  Within a few minutes he had run IR, UV, X-ray and 
a few other tests just to see what was in the middle of the black 
box.  He then took a small tool and began wedging the corner of it 
open until the lid popped up.  Slowly, he lifted it off and revealed 
the small transmitter board that the X-ray scan had shown.

	"So what do we got?" gruffly asked Nemesis, still 
pessimistically leaning on the wall.

	"Transmitter box.  It essentially controlled the bomb.  
However, it could have been triggered by someone else with some 
form of an electronic signal."

	"So she had a fail safe in her, huh?"  he said moving closer 
to Donna again.  He brushed her cheek with his index finger and 
moved his face close to hers.  "You got outta this easy wench" he 
whispered to her.  Standing up, he moved over to take the box in 
his hand.  "So can you figure out who made it or who could 
detonate it?" he asked looking at Doc.

	"Maybe.  It'll take some time."

	"Contact me in the usual way in one day" replied Nemesis 
as he handed the box back to Doc and motioned Slash to following 
him out the door.  

	"What about your woman?"

	"Oh yeah."  Nemesis grabbed a nearby trash bag and 
worked it over Donna's head and torso after removing her bonds.  
He scooped her up so that she was crunched upside down into the 
bag and then proceeded to head up the stairs.

	As Doc verified the garage door closing from his wall 
monitor he dialed into his telecom and waited while the security 
codes played their game before opening a screen.

	"What is it?" came Nebulus' tired voice.

	"We've got a few problems."

******************

	"So what the hell are you going to do with her?" 
reprimanded Slash as she drove into the next alleyway.

	"Pull up next to that dumpster over there?"  The van 
stopped and Nemesis pulled Donna's body out of the van, throwing 
it into the dumpster without a care.  He returned to the van to 
fetch a can of gasoline and proceeded to pour some of the can's 
contents onto Donna's body.  He returned to the van and picked 
up an old oil rag.  Lighting it, the van began to move away as he 
threw it into the dumpster and slid the van's side door shut.

     I crouched down in the shadow of the counter between the kitchen
 and the dinette and quickly assessed my current situation. Not bad consid-
 ering. I had my knife, two throwing spikes and one flechette round left in
 my pistol, and I counted no more than three of the enemy left mobile out
 there. Damn cats had been ready to mount a major offensive, but I had
 caught them a little flat footed. They weren't expecting anyone to come
 by the mobile home where my friend, Disk Driver, lived. Shaggra! I hadn't
 expected to come by either, but since I'd happened to be in the neighbor-
 hood...you know how the rest goes.
     I pulled up noticing that the lights were on and music playing
 loudly
 over Driver's stereo. The high volume was typical, but it didn't strike
 me as odd, until later, that the music had a definite martial sound to
 it, sort of like military parade music.
     Grinning to myself and planning to put a scare into Driver by
 crashing the party I moved quietly up to the front door, turned the knob
 and leaped into the living room screaming at the top of my lungs.
     Driver was definitely surprised. He jumped noticeably on the couch
 where he was tied, and I noticed his eyes widen above the gag that had
 been tied firmly in place.
    Hold it. Let's do a quick inventory. Driver tied and gagged on the
 couch. Military music, still, playing on the stereo. Next to the
 computer that was now displaying what looked suspiciously like a city

 map was a small banner showing a sword held in an armored fist. Also in
 the room were a few dozen cats, the typical house hold varieties, who
 were wearing these odd pack like objects strapped to thier persons.
 Standing next to the banner was a cat who was somewhat larger than the
 rest wearing his own pack plus something that looked like half armor and a
helmet with goggles...continued...

 Wait, back up. The large cat was standing,
 as in two legs,and it didn't seem to occur to him, as it did to me, that
 this was in any way peculiar. If he did find it strange, he covered it
 up quite well with his initial surprise at my entrance, then with the
 hastily uttered commands to the other cats in the room. As I saw the
 cats begin to react to my presence it occured to me that if I was going
 to have time to be surprised by these recent revelations I was going to
 have to do a good job of getting myself out of here.
     I turn-jumped back to the still open door behind me, my mind only
 half registering the silvery field that sprang up in front of it.
 It gaveslightly as I hit, and threw me forcibly back into the room. I'm
 glad my mind had half noticed it for that was all I needed to tuck and
 roll my way back to my feet.
      Oh boy. Technologically advanced cats. Just my day. My mind decided
 to let some of the surprise seep in as I stared at the barrier in ill-
 concealed shock.
      There was a high pitched chuckle behind me that I worked up the
 nerve to turn around and face. What I'm going to assume was the cat
 leader was facing me with his hands behind his back. Why did it bother
 me so to see a cat in this particular posture? He was talking to me, I
 should be listening.
     "...surrender seems to be the only option available to you, don't
 you agree?"
- More (Y)/N/NS? 
     His voice was oddly accented and, like I'd already noticed, high
 pitched, but it had a certain musical quality that made it sound
 slightly Oriental.
     "Oh come now!", he (I assume) said with some asperity, "You are out
 numbered and unarmed. Each one of my troops is armed with a high
 intensity flame thrower that will fry you where you stand much easier
 than the human fortifications that we plan on hitting tonight."
     His next comment clued me that my expressions were displaying my
 thoughts and that somehow this cat commander had learn to read human
 body language. continued...

     "Faking surprise will avail you not. Do not try and disguise the
 fact that you came to spy and try to figure out someway to stop cat
 domination of this globe. On second thought it occurs to me that you
 are now much to dangerous to be allowed to live. Troopers, take this
 spy and the other human animal outside and incinerate them. Do it
 quickly, we are ready to launch the attack now and we have no time to
 waste."
      I'd been watching the cats with their flame throwers(?), and it
 dawned on me that they weren't really combat trained soldiers. They had
 just been recently impressed into service and the cat commander was de-
 pending on surprise to carry the night.
      It was really a shame he thought I was unarmed. I was hoping that
 their lack ofcombat-reflexes would play to my advantage as I pulled my
 machine pistol and let loose with automatic flechette rounds at the cats
 jostling for the honor of killing the first human in this war.
     Cats yowled and screamed as armor and muscle tearing slivers ripped
 into thier ranks. Many of the deadly flakes tore into the gel fuel packs
 that supplied the flame throwers. Since my rounds were non-incendiary no
 damage was done until one of the trigger happy tried to hose me. Then
 the fun started as the fuel ignited and some of the packs exploded
 spraying the interior of the mobile home with burning fuel.
     It wouldn't be until later that I learned that the concussion had
 overturned the couch and the thick material had saved Driver from being
- More (Y)/N/NS? 
 caught in the inferno. As I was busy trying to save my own hide I
 didn't feel bad about it until I'd dived for cover behind the kitchen
 counter. Let me tell you my conscience ate me up for a few seconds
 there. I'd even avoided shooting at the cat commander for the simple
 fact that he'd been standing too close to Driver and I probably would
 have caught him with some of the slivers as well.

      Smelling cooked cat, and what I assumed to be human, flesh and
 hearing the fire burn I figured now was the time to leave. Let the
 police and fire departments try and figure this one out. Looking at the
 back door and the windows I noticed that silvery field over them as
 well. Standing up I noticed the front door was still similarly
 protected. I also noticed that the fires were dying down quickly. Maybe
 there was something to all the advertising about the fire-resistant
 materials that went into the construction of modern homes.
      I still had two rounds left so I aimed at the field on the front
 door and squeezed. The field incresed in brightness as the slivers
 struck the field and...stuck there melting rapidly into white-hot
 liquid. Perhaps it would be feasible to consider turning the field off
 before I attempted an exit.
     I dropped heavily to the floor as pain exploded in my leg from a
 pencil thin beam of light. The cat commander stood up to his full 15"
 cradling a similarly scaled rifle in the crook of his right foreleg/arm.
 Flanking him on either side were two normal four footed cats with
 flamers and goggles. I recognized these two. They were Driver's own cats
 suddenly gone techno-punk.  This was not good.
     "Before I kill you, animal," the commander sneered,"I will allow you
 to die with the satisfaction of knowing that you have completely
 thwarted our invasion plans. The world as you know it will be safe for
 a few more of our generations. Think of yourself as a hero."
- More (Y)/N/NS? 
     He took a step back, still covering me with the rifle, and depressed
 a key on the computer. The air next to him shimmered slightly and
 coalesced into a silvery circle about 2 feet across.

     He raised the rifle muzzle to the ceiling and said, "As one soldier
 to another, I salute you." and did this wierd cat thing with his tail.
 He then turned to Driver's two cats. "Lieutenants, finish him off and
 then prepare to gate through with me so I can show you how cats were
 truly meant to live."
     In desperation I dived back behind the kitchen counter and pushed
 against the barrier blocking the sliding glass doors. No luck. It didn't
 do more than give slightly.
     Hearing the cats moving closer, and not exactly relishing the idea
 of being burned to death. I slid quietly back to the corner of the
 counter and slid out both throwing spikes. Assuming correctly that I
 was dangerous the cats were moving carefully as well, but they weren't
 yet accustomed to the added bulk of the flamers and I could see thier
 crouching shadows cast by the silvery "gate" circle. As they were
 getting ready to pounce I threw one spike at the wall opposite my
 position. As the cats spun to confront the new sound-threat, the second
 spike quickly followed it into the fuel pack of one of the "lieutenants".
 Shaggra, was I glad I couldn't remember thier names right then. I
 didn't want to think of them as the cute cuddly furballs they had once
 been, but as the killer/soldiers they had become.
      I didn't know how the damnable flamers were triggered but I was
 depending on inexperience as I brought one hand down on the unspiked
 cat. Already spooked and jumpy he cut loose at the target that I made
- More (Y)/N/NS? 
 sure his body was aimed at. His fellow lieutenant.
      The exploding pack was close enough to me and the cat I held down
 that we both got singed as the others yowl was quickly silenced in the
 engulfing flames.

      The cat I held pulled a trick that all cats have known since they
 were first created. Somehow he managed to twist around in my grip and
 fasten his claws in my arm. I picked him and threw him bodily across
 the room, leaving deep bloody gashes in my arm, and through the waiting
 gate circle. He disappeared with an audible pop.
      The commander leveled his rifle at me and fired. The bright red
 beam missed, but my last flechette round didn't. His armor managed to
 stop most of it, but a few managed to tear flesh and the the rifle
 dropped from his now useless arm. He glared at me from the computer
 terminal.
      "I'll be back, human, but next time I'll have you fighting in the
 arena for the entertainment of the audiences back home."
      With that he stepped through the circle and disappeared. I let my
 shoulders slump and allowed myself to feel what damage had been done to
 me. It was then I heard muffled thumpings and yellings from behind the
 over turned couch. Tipping it back I was pleased to discover Driver
 just a little bit mussed from all the excitement. I began helping
 them up when I heard a thump behind me. Spinning around, half-expecting
 to see more soldier cats, I calmed down when I didn't see anyone. My
 attention was captured, however, by a small, round object that lay on
 the body litterd and burned floor near the still shimmering gate circle,
 hissing slightly.
    "The cat commander wouldn't be such a poor sport that he would throw
- More (Y)/N/NS? 
 a grenade back through the gate now would he?" I thought out loud.
 Not wanting the take any chances, I flipped the knife I still had left
 at it, and, catching it just right, watched it tumble back through the
 circle. I then reached over and turned the computer off watching with
 some satisfaction as the barrier fields and the gate circle shimmered
 into non-existence. After all, playing a game of inter-dimensional hot
 potato is something I save for the holidays...

=========================================================================================

PICTURE PERFECT
  by Roberta Belinda

  Rafe gazed out of his window at the sea reflecting the overcast 
sky. Shrugging tiredly, he went out into the mist-filled air. He walked 
to the beach and let the cold water lap at his tired feet. He still was 
carrying his paintbrush, which he twiddled in his hand as he walked. The 
sea air always had helped him think, but was failing that night. A picture 
of a girl was clawing at his mind, willing him to paint her. The vision 
remained faceless and try as he may, Rafe could not place the perfect 
visage to be framed by the lovely gold-tinged tresses.

  The moon glided in the sky accompanying Rafe as he travelled further 
along the beach. He drew his hand through his curly, chestnut hair, and 
his wide, sensitive mouth mellowed into a smile. His dark brown eyes 
softened with unshed tears as his loneliness became evident. Sighing, 
he made his way back to the cottage as the breeze caressed him and 
whispered words of comfort.

  As he entered his home, the white, empty canvas seemed to mock him. He 
threw his brush at it in retaliation and realized he was being silly but
didn't care at the moment. While he slept that night, the faceless vision
stretched her arms to him, pleading, willing, demanding him to make her 
live. He was locked into a cage, captured by the dream. And he knew it 
was true that he was indeed a prisoner of this fiction. Would that he 
could make her real.

  As the morning light stabbed at his tired eyes, Rafe woke up in a 
surly mood. Grumbling, and mumbling he made his way through his morning 
chores and decided to go to town for more supplies. The road was dusty 
and he coughed and sneezed as he walked, which made him even grumpier. 
When they would pave this road would be anyone's guess he figured. Coming 
into the town he spied a gypsy's wagon. This mildly interested Rafe, as 
gypsies always travel in caravans and not in solitary vehicles. 

  His normally insatiable curiousity, however, was dampened by his gloomy 
mood so he passed by the wagon without investigating. As he did he espied 
a slight figure standing next to the wagon wearing a shawl about her hair 
and face. As she turned from him, he caught a quick glimpse of brilliant 
blue eyes, like the sky at dawn. Again he grouchily figured that gypsies 
never stay long anyway, so it would be no use in introducing himself.

  Rafe paid the storekeeper for the supplies and walked into the 
courtyard. He noted that a woman had stopped to speak to the gypsy but 
didn't seem to be shooing her off. Surprisingly, she took her to the 
boarding house instead. A man came out and led the cart and horse away. He 
was about to query someone as to who she was, but decided against it. He 
was going to be too busy staring at a blank canvas to concern himself over 
some girl. Making his way home though, he discovered his mood had lifted a 
bit in spite of all efforts to remain glum.

  Meanwhile, the young woman sat forlornly upon the straight, wooden 
chair in the foyer of the boarding house. She had removed her scarf and 
amber hair lay in heavy brushstrokes about her shoulders. She nervously 
pleated the hem of her dress as she waited for the woman to come back. 
Lyra was sure that she would not be accepted here. She was a vagabond, 
afterall. The woman came back smiling though, carrying linens and a 
plain, simple dress for her to wear. Lyra looked down at her gaudy beads 
and brightly colored clothing and concluded the lady was right.

  "Here we go child. We can't have you walking around like that. The 
women's church group would have a fit,"  The boarding house matron 
chuckled.

  "Thank you for having me. I will try not to be a bother madame. Do you 
know where I might find work?" she asked.

  The lady mused over this for awhile and then a gleam came into her eye. 
She looked the girl over as she stroked her chin. "Yes! I believe I do.

  Lyra smiled unsteadily, a bit tired at her journey. Her small, heart-
shaped face grew pale. The matron dropped the things she was carrying and 
hurried over to her. "My goodness! You look terrible! Enough about work 
and all that. Let us concern ourselves with getting cleaned up and rested. 
A nice hot bath will do you well. If you should need anything just call 
for me. My name is Mrs. Mintrel."

  The young woman rose and followed Mrs. Mintral who had stooped to 
collect the things she had dropped. The room she took her to was plain, 
but was clean and neat. There was an adjoining bathroom. The matron smiled 
proudly saying, "I have the only boarding house for miles that has private 
bathrooms here in England. Enjoy!"

  Lyra was amazed to see the bathtub, having only washed in streams and 
lakes all her life. As the matron left, she started to run the water and 
realized how hot it was. She quickly removed her hand and turned the other 
spigot to see what came out of that one. Cold water soothed her stinging 
member. She sighed in relief and having plugged the hole, the bathtub soon 
filled with soothing, warm water, which she happily submerged herself in. 
This had to be heaven!

  After her bath, Lyra came out and found that Mrs. Mintral had left a 
nice flannel nightgown for her to wear. The material felt as soft as down 
as she slipped it on. She brushed and braided her still damp hair and 
pounced on the tall feather bed, sinking into its softness. Nestling under 
the covers, she thought of the man she saw in town. He had looked so sad, 
and she wondered why. He had a beautiful mouth, such a mouth should have 
been smiling. Her eyes drooped as she pondered, and soon she slumbered.

                              *  *  *

  Over in the seaside cottage, a battle was raging. Rafe was nearly 
pulling his hair out in frustration, as he threw yet another unacceptable 
painting out the open window. His yard was littered with dozens of golden-
brown haired girls, all whom were lovely masterpieces, but none satisfying 
his vision. Surveying the mess he had made, he decided it was time to quit. 
Sighing, he realized he had less than two months before his next showing 
and he needed to get this painting done. But, today would not be the day.

  His stomach growled making him aware that it was suppertime. He didn't 
feel like cooking, instead, he would brave the dusty road back to town. 
So he set off, and as he approached the town it was starting to get dark. 
Mrs. Mintrel was nearly closing the restaurant, but saw Rafe and smilingly 
ushered him in. Having settled down with a bowl of chowder, he looked 
around the restaurant.

  He thought he saw someone peep at him through the door to the kitchen, 
but when he looked again, the person was gone. Did he really see auburn 
hair? He was working much too hard he thought as he rubbed his eyes 
tiredly. He wondered if perhaps Mrs. Mintrel had the gypsy girl working 
in the kitchen. Shrugging, he rose and called out to the matron who came 
and took his money, asking him to visit her again as he left.

  Lyra's heart was beating as she realized that the man had seen her. 
She didn't know why he affected her this way, but she felt incredibly shy 
in his presence. Maybe it was because his hair begged for her to twine her 
fingers in its locks, or that his eyes reminded her of the baby fawn she 
once had as a pet. Now that he had left, she felt sad, thinking she had 
missed an opportunity to meet him. Who knew how long she would be allowed 
to stay? All her life she had been warned that the townfolk hated gypsies. 
But the people here had welcomed her, saddened that her caravan had been 
killed, and the fact that she wasn't a true gypsy, but was taken as a baby. 
Still she never hated the woman who had stolen her, for she cherished Lyra 
as her own mother would have.

  Lyra dried her hands after doing the dishes and approached Mrs. Mintral.
"Thank you for letting me help in the kitchen. I want to earn my keep," 
she said shyly.

  Mrs. Mintrel held her face in her hands. " My dear! You are far too 
pretty too work in a kitchen! Your lovely fingers will grow rough and dry 
with the harsh soap and scrubbing. Hopefully, we can find a much better 
job for you to do! This is not the employ that I have planned for you."

  Lyra was astonished at the depths of charity that this woman had 
within her. She was sure no one was as beautiful as this old woman was, 
not even she. This woman's husband must bless the Lord everyday that he is 
alive to have such a treasure in his midst. "Really, madame. You have done 
far too much for me already!"

  "Tut, tut! I won't hear another word," Mrs. Mintrel said, as scooted 
Lyra out the restaurant door. "Tomorrow we need to find you more suitable 
work."

   Lyra prepared for bed that night, with the thought that she had never 
had the luxury of sleeping twice in one day. But, she was tired, and 
thankful that she was able to. She dreamt the sea was a man with fathomless 
eyes and strong sinuous body. The waves were like his hair. she dived into 
the depths of him and didn't wish to be rescued. She floated further out 
into the sea lost forever in the leagues of his gaze. Suddenly she awoke 
to a cold chill -- the window had been left open. The salt in the air bit 
her nose and she rose to close it. The stars, sparkling gems in the sky 
made her pause, and she leaned on the window and thought that tomorrow she 
would like to go to the seashore. The memory of her dream nudged at her 
knowingly, and she laughed.
   
  Hopping back into bed after closing the window, she hoped she would 
dream again. Sighing, she settled back into sleep, her smile giving clue 
to what her mind beheld.

  In another bed, the occupant was not so tranquil. He was sure he had 
seen someone in that kitchen. And surely, the flash of bronze was not in 
his imagination. He gazed up at the beams in his ceiling and thought of 
how he must be going mad. He was seeing brown- haired women wherever he 
went. It had to be an illusion; his vision was haunting him during the 
day now as well. Tossing and turning, he finally dozed off into a restless 
sleep, his final thought being how he must ask Mrs. Mintrel about that 
gypsy girl.

                              *  *  *

  A little bird twittered playfully outside Lyra's window as she bustled 
about the room. Mrs. Mintral had welcomed the idea of a visit to the beach, 
and so Lyra was being extra swift with her morning routine. As she trotted 
down the stairs, The old woman had just set a picnic basket on the trestle 
table near the door. Outside, the horse was chomping impatiently at his 
bit, kicking the dirt with his hoof. Lyra picked up the basket against all 
of Mrs. Mintral's protests and they set off in the carriage to the beach.

  The sun danced merrily in the sky and sent beams of warmth on them as 
they arrived at the shore. The waves wagged beckoning fingers at Lyra, 
begging her to come frolick among them. She saw a couple of lonely clouds 
in the sky as she raised her head to breathe in the salt air. Not being 
able to constrain herself any longer, she kicked off her shoes and hiked 
her skirts, while Mrs. Mintral admonished her in mock dismay. Running to 
the lapping water, she hopped and skipped in the icy surf. Her hands flew 
to her hair and she pulled the ribbon binding it demurely. As she twirled, 
burnished flames seemed to burst from her head. The matron sighed at the 
lovely picture she was making, reminding her of how she was once as a 
youngster, with hair just like Lyra's.

  The sounds of Lyra's laughter were carried on the wind to Rafe's 
house. Looking up from his tea, he glanced at the window. Rising he went 
to it and tried to strain a peek at who the owner of that lilting sound 
may be. He could not see the person from his vantage point, but espied 
Mrs. Mintral. His heart leapt in anticipation as he debated whether to go 
investigate. His curiousity got the better of him and he bolted out the 
door down to the seaside. As he neared, he could hear the old woman 
chastising the girl for getting her skirts wet. Once again, the sound of 
laughter clear as a bell rang out from the sea. This spurred Rafe to pick 
up his pace and he hurried to a large rock near the matron. Hiding behind 
the rock, he poked his head around the side to see who was playing so 
happily in the water.

  The girl appeared to belong to the sea. She was graceful and slender 
as a reed, skipping nimbly over the waves. Rafe stood mesmerized by the 
dazzling sight before him, then it dawned on him. Her hair was like 
shining columns of burnished gold. Straightly it flew about her head as 
she spun, taking on a life of its own. Golden-brown hair, could this be? 
Suddenly, Rafe was afraid to be seen. Running, he whisked away from the 
happy women, fearing rejection. Lyra stilled her dance as she spied him 
running away. Sadly she watched him dash on, thinking he must have been 
disgusted with her. Quietly, she emerged from the surf and asked if they 
could return to town.

  Lyra was very subdued on her trip home. Large teardrops began spilling 
from her lovely eyes and she fell on Mrs. Mintral. The older woman clasped 
the girl to her in surprise. "What is wrong, child? You were so happy 
dancing in the sea!"

  "Oh, Mrs Mintral! He hates me! He ran away from us like I was a 
MONSTER!" Lyra sobbed.

  Mrs Mintral's whole body shook with mirth. Lyra looked up at her 
curiously to see what was so amusing. Between guffaws the woman managed 
to say. "Oh my dear girl! He doesn't hate you! Oh ho ho no! I saw how he 
was looking at you out of the corner of my eye."

  "I saw him also, but was pretending not to. He never came out to say 
hello! If he liked me so much he would not have ran away," Lyra replied, 
dismally.

  The matron sighed in exasperation and eyed the girl in disbelief. 
Shaking her head, she left the matter closed and the trip went on in 
silence, broken only by the occasional melancholy sound from Lyra. 
They arrived back at the boarding house and Lyra ran to her room. After 
punching her pillow angrily a few dozen times she decided that she was 
being childish and maybe she should just take a nap. She stared awhile 
at the ceiling and thought how wonderful he looked as he ran. A strong 
stallion or proud buck would be put to shame at his powerful gait. How 
she wished he had been running to her instead of away and she pouted 
prettily. Closing her eyes, she tried to rest, knowing that she would 
have work to do for the missus.

                              *  *  *

   After her nap, Lyra still felt depressed. She left her bedroom and
made her way to the dining room where Mrs. Mintral was sitting down 
at the table with a sad, far-away look in her eyes. Lyra felt selfish, 
having been sobbing over something so trivial, and never realizing 
something was wrong with the old woman.

   She sat down next to her and put her hand on the matron's. Lyra's 
azure eyes were filled with concern as she tried to comfort her. Mrs. 
Mintral smiled wanly and tried to compose herself. "Oh do not mind me. 
I am just going over some old memories . . . and I am afraid that seeing 
you with your lovely hair so much like mine when I was young does not 
help in forgetting the pain."

  Lyra leaned back in surprise, unsure of what was being said."Do go on 
Mrs. Mintrel. I am curious now."

  The woman wrung her hands ashamedly. "Many years ago, I had a lovely 
little girl. She was the light of my life and I loved her so. One day, 
when she was a little over a year old, we went to the market. I'm afraid 
I was haggling with the storekeeper over the price of her apples. Seems 
so dumb, and trivial after what happened next. My little love, Lina, saw 
a puppy scamper by, so she ran after it. I did not see her until she went 
around the corner. When I did spot her, of course I ran frantically after 
her! But, when I got to the corner, she was gone. The townspeople searched 
for her for days, but eventually, we had to admit to ourselves that it was 
a hopeless case. I admit that I took you in because you look much like 
what she might have looked like had she grown up. I have a picture of her: 
I have it in this locket. She had one just like it around her neck with a 
picture of me inside."

  As the lady held the locket out in front of Lyra, her eyes grew wider 
and wider. Shaking, she drew something out from inside her neckline. In 
her hand was an identical locket. She opened it, and inside was a tin-
portrait of Mrs. Mintrel when she was young.  "I can't believe this! I 
only have this locket because I took it off of my adoptive mother when 
they were all murdered by passing soldiers. I wanted something to 
remember her by. I never even looked inside it after all this time. I 
knew that they took me when I was a baby, but she had loved me. I was 
never treated badly."

  Mrs. Mintrel was sobbing with joy. "My little Lina. I have found you! 
I'm so sorry I ever took my eyes off of you! Oh my dearest joy!"

  Lyra smiled at her. "I finally have a real mother. But, may I keep Lyra 
as my name? I know it was wicked what she had done, but she must really 
have wanted a child. My name is all I have to remember her by."

  Mrs. Mintrel nodded her approval. "As long as I have you back, I dont 
care if your name is Samuel!"

  Lyra giggled and squeezed her mother tightly. She was really home. She 
would never have to leave here. Now, if only the painter liked her. This 
dampened her spirits a little, but she tried to forget him and squeezed 
her mother even closer while unknowingly, the object of her desire trudged 
up the path at that very moment.

  As the women embraced, Rafe stomped up the steps to the boarding house,  
he knocked loudly on the door. Lyra started at the sound and jumped up. 
"Who could that be?" she cried in surprise.

  Mrs. Mintrel shrugged. "whomever it is, it must either be very important, 
or they are very rude!" She replied. 

  Lyra ran to the door and flung it open, meaning to give the perpetrator 
a piece of her mind! She stood gaping as she gazed face to face into the 
deep brown eyes of Rafe. He stood dumbfounded as well, as his faceless 
vision was transformed into the beautiful wonder that was standing before 
him. He was still unsure of how she felt about him, so he pretended that 
he was angry. "I saw you on the beach and did you know that you were not 
allowed there? That is private property!"

  Her mouth dropped open for a second in astonishment, and then she 
quickly snapped it shut. "No I did not! I know you live close by the beach, 
but I had no idea that you owned it."

  Mrs. Mintral came to the door as she heard the ruckus going on. "What 
is going on? Rafe! What is the meaning of this?"

  Rafe was starting to feel like a first class oaf by this time, but he
could think of no other way to get her to be near him. "I never gave 
permission to use my beach! I must ask for some sort of recompense!"

  Lyra's eyes flashed blue fire. "By all means! What does his Lordship 
require?" she spat sarcastically.

  He leaned back on his heels and his eyes narrowed, making them dark as 
coal. "What you must do is come work for me. I need someone to paint and 
also I could use someone to have around the house to clean and whatnot."

  Mrs. Mintral tsked disapprovingly at him. " Rafe, you have never acted 
like this! I know you own that  part of the beach, but you've always let 
people play there!"

  "Yes, but I was disturbed! I must ask recompense or I will have to 
complain to the constable!" he roared.  And he was disturbed, she had 
been in his thoughts since the day he first laid eyes on her.

  Lyra stomped her foot. "Oh all right! But only as long as it takes 
to paint me and then that is it! You can complain all you want to the 
constable after that!"

  Rafe could not believe his luck at having got away with this. He 
pretended to consider her proposal, having already decided it was good 
enough. To have her for even a short time would be paradise. "Fair enough. 
I must ask you to come right now. Have Mrs. Mintral pack for you for I will 
need you to stay there. I don't know how long it will take for me to finish 
painting you and I don't want to travel up this dusty road to fetch you 
everyday."

 "I can travel to your house! Why must I stay with you?" She hissed.

 Rafe waved his hand disparagingly." I do not want to have to wait for you 
to come to my house! That is what I require!"

  Lyra looked like she was going to hurl him down the steps so her mother
stepped in front of her. " Oh, yes. That will be fine! We are very sorry 
that we DISTURBED you, and we will be happy to settle the matter in anyway 
that you see fit."

  She looked at her mother as if she had gone mad, but then sighed and 
nodded in agreement. Rafe bounded down the steps happily, which Lyra took 
to be gloating. Mrs Mintrel closed the door and leaned against it grinning. 
She had seen right through his little ruse and was very pleased!

  Lyra trailed along behind Rafe, seething inside. How could someone so
handsome be so mean? If it hadn't meant that her mother may also have 
been in trouble, she would have told this Mr. So and so what she thought 
of his little demand! He strided on in front of her, seeming oblivious to 
her black thoughts, his steps long and cat-like. She admired his gait in 
spite of herself, never having seen someone move with such grace. Then she 
mentally kicked herself for giving in to her raging hormones.

  Rafe felt a little sheepish as he walked in front, hearing her low
grumblings behind him. But he felt elated as well, feeling that he at 
least had a chance this way to win her. Hopefully familiarity wouldn't 
breed more contempt! He grinned happily and looked back at her. "Come on 
now, let us not drag behind! We are almost to my house."

  Lyra glowered but quickened her pace until she was walking next to 
him. His nearness sent her reeling as she took in the woodsy scent of 
his cologne. She felt frustrated that she was still attracted to him even 
though he wasn't what she thought he would be. Perhaps he would be nicer 
if she apologized. "Look. I am sorry that we trespassed, I really had no 
idea."

  Rafe looked at her and grinned, shaking his head. "Well it is nice to 
hear an apology, but I still want you to do as I asked."

  "You meant demanded did you not!?" Lyra shot back.

   He grinned at her even more broadly. When he smiled his whole face 
would light up with a soft glow. She had trouble not being dazzled by him. 
She turned her face from him so as to not belie her feelings. " Oh forget 
it!"

  A low, silky laugh rippled out of him, which sent goosebumps up her 
back. If she stayed this close to him she would not be reponsible for her 
actions She spied the cottage and quickly sprinted the rest of the way to 
the door, making distance between her and the strange feelings this man 
gave her.

                              *  *  *   

  Rafe admired her as she dashed in front of him. She was tiny and 
faerie-like as she ran. He was unsure whether it was a mistake to insist 
that she stay with him, for she was far too adorable to keep his hands 
off of. Being a gentleman though, he vowed not to sully her by making 
advances. But he did take off in pursuit, reaching her as she made it to 
the door. He grabbed her about the waist and set her on the high wall as 
she protested, thrilling at his touch. Laughing, he regarded her as she 
pounded on the wall in rage.

  "Let me down from here you! Just who do you think you are? " she fumed.

  He gazed up at her with dancing eyes. "Oh I do not know. You make a nice
lawn decoration I think. This wall can use some sprucing up. Besides, I 
want to paint you up there. I do believe you would be better trusted up 
where you cannot reach me right now, at least until you calm down," he 
teasingly replied.

  Lyra paused a moment at this audacity and then huffed. "Well, if you 
think putting me up here will calm me down, you have another thing coming! 
I would not like to be you when I manage to get down from here!" she said 
glancing about herself for a way to escape, but the wall was too high.

  Rafe only laughed in that maddeningly seductive way and entered the 
cottage to retrieve his canvas and supplies. Outside, Lyra was still 
kicking on the wall and looking about her for a toe-hold. She wished that 
he did not make her blood burn so, for he was being beastly. She finally 
sighed in resignation and ceased thrashing about. Rafe returned, carrying 
his things, and smiled up at her. "Calmed down? That's good. It is hard 
to paint a moving object!" he teased once again.

  "Oh I am just reserving my energy until I get a chance to murder you!" 
she vainly threatened. She knew she would never be able to hurt him for 
inspite of herself, she was growing fond of him.

  He shook his head in mock despair and set up his things. There was 
still daylight so he wanted to start quickly. The sun set the golden 
strands in her hair afire, making a glowing halo around her head. His face 
gave away for a moment the naked adoration that he felt for her, startling 
her and stirring something within. His expression became blank as he 
realized how hewas baring his soul. Joy spread within him as he painted 
her. She was perfect. She was what he had dreamt of. The lines of her body 
flowed beautifully across his canvas, creating a stunning portrait of love. 
He decided he would never be able to let her go, even if that meant that 
he had to paint one million portraits of her. He could paint her forever 
so that would be bliss. 

  After a few hours the sky grew dimmer and he closed his easel. "Okay, 
if you promise to not bite off an ear, or pull my hair, I will let you 
down now," he said.

  Lyra narrowed her eyes as she considered his request. "Well, okay, as 
long as you promise to feed me! I am too weak with hunger to attack you 
anyway," she replied.

  Rafe chuckled. "Oh come now, you have not been up there that long." 
He reached up and lifted her off the wall, letting her body slide slowly 
down his length until she was just under his chin. Having her this close, 
he felt the quick beating of her heart against his chest before she pushed 
away.

  She smiled unsteadily. Had she heard his breath quicken? She dismissed 
the thought and said, "Well, are you going to waste me to nothing, or are 
you going to feed me?"

  Rafe grinned and went into the house with Lyra following him. She 
loved his cozy little home. It had a cheery fire blazing and paintings 
everywhere. His paintings were truly wondrous with emotion and life 
emanating from them. She paused at one and touched it, thinking she would 
actually be able to reach for the object. She shook her head in disbelief 
at the realism he had attained.

  "You truly are good, Rafe. I love your work." She said truthfully.

   Rafe moved to her side and looked up at the painting. "Thank you. But 
the work I did today eclipses anything I've ever undertaken." he said as 
he grabbed her hand and pulled her to the portrait he had made of her.

  Lyra gasped in awe at the work. She looked like an angel with beams of 
light flowing out of her. Her hair in the painting seemed to be moving 
and her eyes were bright with mischeif. She looked at him with her mouth 
ajar. "This is beautiful! I am not that lovely!" she cried.

  Rafe only sighed. "I need to paint you tomorrow too. Be ready in the
morning and do not be late. I have dinner for us on the table. Please 
eat with me?" he said.

  Lyra ignored his demand and centered on his changed demeanor. He was 
not being boorish any longer. His eyes were gentle and pleading as he 
requested her presence. Her resolve, to argue that she was only going to 
stay for this one painting -- melted. Sighing, she nodded and went to the 
table. He had placed coldcuts, cheese and bread on it. Apologetically 
he said, "I know it is not much, but I did not think you would have come."

  She glanced at him sharply. "You did not think I would have come? After 
you threatened to throw me in jail??"

  He sheepishly grinned. "Oh that. I was not really going to. I was just
posturing. But I do still need to paint you so would you please stay? "


  Confused, Lyra muttered her assent. Why did he go to all that bother 
if he just wanted to paint her? He could have just asked! She chewed her 
lip pensively and regarded him with queroulous blue eyes. Well she did not 
know what he was up to, but she was going to play along for now. She could 
not say no anyway to those dark eyes pleading at her so.

  After dinner she perused his bookshelf and selected a title. He had 
the same passion for mysteries that she had. As she settled in a chair 
with her book, Rafe sat in the chair opposite her, watching her as she 
read. She looked up every now and again, uneasy under his gaze. Soon 
though, he had dropped off and she let the book fall in her lap. Sleeping, 
he looked like a fragile little boy. His mouth had softened and his lashes 
fanned across his cheek-bones. She had the urge to touch him, and knelt 
down beside his chair. His hair had fell onto his face and she brushed it 
back. The lock was soft as silk as her fingers grazed through it. Her 
touch made him murmur and his eyes opened.

  Stepping back, she stuttered, "Oh, you had fallen asleep. I was just 
going to suggest that you go to bed."

  Sleepily he stared up at her. Had she caressed him? No, that must have 
been a dream. Groggily he staggered up and made his way to his bedroom.
Falling on his bed he smiled. She did touch him.

  Lyra could not believe that she had touched him and was further dismayed
that she wanted to do it again. She lay in the guest bed and stared at the
ceiling as her desire raged within her. Finally she dropped into a fitful 
sleep.

                              *  *  *

  The morning was not welcomed by Lyra and she glared at the sunny sky. 
Her embarrassment had only grown more strong with the passing hours. Her 
ears pricked as she heard a merry whistle outside her door. Rafe was 
certainly cheerful this morning. Seeing as she had nearly thrown herself 
at him she was sure that he was feeling smug. She threw her pillow at the 
door and the whistling stopped.

  "Come on, Lyra! I said not to be late!" He called through the door. 

  What Lyra said could not be comprehended through the heavy wood but Rafe
got the general meaning from her tone. When he heard yet another pillow
thud against it he grinned broadly and began whistling again. Lyra emerged
from her room in high dudgeon and stomped past him to breakfast. He had 
made pancakes, eggs, and bacon. She was surprised as she sat down to know 
that he could cook after all. Rafe sat down in front of her and watched her 
in amusement as she savored his cooking.

  "Well I know how to make you smile, at least! Just throw some food in 
your mouth and you will be quiet!" He joked.

  Lyra smiled a bit at his jest. "I am sorry for my bad humor. I have 
not been a very good guest."

  He sat back with slight astonishment. She was apologizing to him after 
he had forced her to come. His face lit up and he bounded out of the chair
while pulling her from the table. He hurried them out of the house so that
he could get his work done. She stumbled a bit at his pace and he picked 
her up tenderly. His concerned face made her heart leap.

  "I am sorry dear lady. I did not realize I was moving to quickly for 
you," he apologized.

  Lyra gazed up at him with warmth dawning in her eyes. Something about 
him belied the gruff exterior that he was putting up. Everything within 
her softened like snow in spring. Her sweet smile rocked him to the core 
and he stepped back from her.

  "Well, I suppose I better paint you so that you can be on your way. I 
will try and do as many as I can in the time I have. I hope you don't mind 
staying that long?" he said, as he gazed at her, still astonished at her
expression.

   Lyra shook her head. "No I do not mind. I am honored that you want to 
paint me. I am sorry that we did not start off on the right foot. Could 
we start again perhaps?" she replied softly.

  Rafe smiled and led her to a chair placed in front of the rose vines
clinging on his home. He did not think that she could have been more 
lovely than she was yesterday, but she had managed. Something had changed 
about her and as he painted it became evident. Love was pouring out of 
her eyes like a shining fountain. He stared at the finished portrait in 
disbelief and then looked at the girl still sitting in the chair. Her 
tender expression mirrored the painting. She slowly rose and neared him, 
looking around the canvas at his work. She gasped in dismay as she saw 
that the picture had betrayed her. Would she ever get over this 
embarassment?

  He touched her shoulder and gently turned her towards him. With one 
finger he lifted her chin so that he could look into her eyes. His eyes 
were brimming with unshed tears as deep emotions began to rip his 
composure. Shocked, she drew him into her arms in comfort. He ran his 
fingers through her long hair, so thick and soft. 

  All the feelings she had for him since the day she first saw him came 
to an apex and she lifted her face for a kiss. Their eyes locked and he 
murmured her name as his lips captured hers. Her body stiffened with 
desire and she twined her fingers in his chestnut curls. Everything passed 
from their eyes and for a brief moment, eternity was he and she. The earth 
resounded with their thundering hearts as they clung together as though 
melded into one body. With a shuddering gasp he released her from his kiss 
and she weakly fell against him, ducking her head on his chest.

  Still shaking with spent emotion, Rafe pulled her inside with him. He
nearly had taken her into his bedroom when he finally realized what he was
doing. Turning he led them to the couch and sat down with her falling into
his lap. He regarded her curiously as he saw mischief gleaming in her eyes.

  "Does this mean that you are done painting me?" she quipped.

  Rafe roared with laughter. "No, I am afraid that your actions have 
made you my prisoner. I am going to have to sentence you to life with me 
forever. What do you have to say to that?" 

  Lyra looked up into his eyes and sighed, "Your honor I plead guilty 
and accept my fate!"

  "Then let us seal this judgement with a kiss, my lovely 
trespasser," Rafe said, as he lowered his head again and sent her world 
spinning once more.

                                        New Story
=========================================================================================



	The marina was full of its usual Saturday morning noises on

  this particularly halcyon August day.  There had been a spell of 

  heavy rain the week before, and with the skies clear and temperature

  high, vacationers and lakegoers were abundant.  A small troupe of

  gulls were making their way across the fairway, catching many an

  unwary fish who ventured too close to the surface.  The ten o'clock

  sun cast its rays into the water, causing the few belly-up fish on

  the surface to glisten.  The sailboat masts pierced the sky and the

  speedboat engines chortled in the morning air.  Boaters were washing 

  their vessels, readying for a lovely cruise on Lake Erie.  A few

  children, accompanied by their parents, seemed calmed by the lake's

  hypnotic serenity.

	Kevin drove by the dock which held his parent's boat.  Nope, his

  parents weren't there yet, just as he figured.  When his parents go

  boating, they usually don't arrive at the marina until about noon.  

	"You wanna drive around for a while? " Kevin asked his girlfriend,

  Sloane.  

	"Yeah.  Let's go up to East Harbor," she replied, pushing the long,

  brown hair out of her face.  With that, Kevin maneuvered the car out of

  the marina and onto the main raod.  Sloane hit the power button on the
 
  radio which caused the speakers to emit an upbeat tune. 

	Sloane was lightly entertained by the scrolling trees and lake

  backfront as they drove.  "The shore looks picture perfect today."

	"You want me to get my camera out?" he mocked her, half serious.

	"No, I'm just saying, it's pretty, you know?"  Smiling, Kevin pulled

  the car onto the side of the road.  "Okay, now where's my camera?"  he said

  as he groped along the back seat of his late-model sports car.

	Finding it, they quickly left the car and went over to the trees.

  They were in a roadside cemetary, about fifty yards from the lake.  "It's

  sort of pretty, in a wierd sort of way," Sloane commented on her

  surroundings.

	"Yeah," Kevin replied, fiddling with his Minolta.  "Why don't you

  go over there?"  He pointed toward an old oak stump, about eight feet
 
  high, whose branches had long fallen off.  It stood just beyond the

  last and oldest footstone, like a lighthouse on a rocky beach.  With

  the light blue sky and tranquil shoreline both readily in view, it would

  be a great backdrop.

	"Now turn around and smile," he called out to her.  She was in perfect

  focus in the viewfinder, next to the massive stump.  An occasional boat

  dotted the lake.

	"Kev, c'mere.  This isn't a tree."

	He was momentarily confused.  "What do you mean, it isn't a tree?"

  He went to see what she was rambling about.

	"Look."

   	She was right.  It was a large, intricately carved granite replica 

  of a tree, with elaborate bark lines and even a small bird's nest 

  accurately depicted on top.  From a relatively close distance, even five

  or six yards, it looked like a venerable old tree.  Closer inspection

  revealed a small cross emblazoned on its south side, and an inconspicuous

  epitaph on the bottom.  In small letters it said, 'Ledge, 1852-1891.'

  	"It's pretty - must have cost a lot," Sloane said.  "Almost as

  good as Kennedy's memorial, with the burning torch."

	Kevin sort of thought about what HIS headstone would one day

  read, but quickly dismissed the thought.  "Who cares, I'll never be around

  to see it."

	"What?" Sloane asked.

	"Nothing.  Let's get something to eat.  I'm hungry."

     I have always been intrigued by the textfile as a medium for the 
exchange of useful information ranging from hacking to kracking, phreaking to 
anarchy, and humor to distaste.  The abundance of information that can be 
obtained from textfiles used to be widely understaged by the many people who 
saw them merely as "g-philes",  using that term in a slightly negative 
connotation.  As of late,  I have seen a movement towards the acceptance of 
textfiles as a viable form of trade through the proliferation of groups such 
as cDc who's main contribution to the modeming society has been their release 
of many fine textfiles ranging from tutorials to interesting stories.  

     What has been bothering me as of late in my ongoing collection of 
textfiles is the lack of quality of some of the files that I receive.  It is 
annoying to download a file that looks like some stupid fuck wrote it by 
slamming his fist down on the keyboard;  the spelling being atrocious and the 
format being unbearable.  I realize that not all of us are scholars,  but it 
only takes a few more minutes to check up on your spelling and format the 
text a bit.  What disgusts me further is that some people DO take the time to 
make their files look pretty,  only to have some complete looze fuck it up by 
viewing it over shitty phone lines and then upload it to another system,
thus causing a perpetuation of a corrupted file.  In most cases,  some of the 
important data gets lost or the effect of the file is shattered because you 
come upon a string of line noise right in the middle of an interesting 
section.  If people would just take the time to handle the files with care,  
there wouldn't be many crap files around.  Unless you're an asshole,  you 
don't check a book out of a library and destroy it.  Let's face it,  fucked 
files are just that:  fucked!  And nobody likes a copy of a fucked file no 
matter how little they care.  Everyone would rather have the file in it's 
original format.

     Since I predict the exchange of textfiles to be a popular pasttime (much 
like the collection of "wares" in the earlier days of Apple pirating),  I 
have written this file in hopes to set a guideline for file writing and 
trading.  You wouldn't put out a "bad" crack,  or a patch that didn't work or 
even fucked up what you were trying to patch.  The same goes for textfiles, 
in the same sense.

     Here are some guidelines to keep in mind when dealing with the trade or
writing of textfiles:

     o If possible,  try to download the file using a protocol so that if any
       line noise is present during your session it won't affect the file.

     o If you must V)iew files,  and if you are planning to upload it to
       another system,  then when you buffer it,  at least try to remove any
       garbage that may have infiltrated the text,  and PLEASE remove all
       transfer prompts (i.e. "[ Volume 10 #1-11 ]" and "(>").  I find those
       most annoying,  especially after they have accumulated after many
       transfers between different systems.

     o Don't try to do the general modem public a favor by "editing" files.
       Let sleeping dogs lie.  If the author intended the file to be in all
       uppercase then that's how it should stay.  The same goes for 40 column
       textfiles.  They don't need to be stretched out to 80 columns.  They
       still read the same either way.

     o Never add your say to a file or modify the original authors work just
       because you feel strongly about the subject.  You wouldn't change
       Shakespear's words around in any of his works (unless you were in
       school and had nothing better to do).  Modifying other peoples work is
       the sign of a true loser.  I saw this done to "The Real Pirates Guide"
       and it totally disgusted me (you're a fucken loser for that,  Dak)!

     o When writing files,  don't neglect to include the date (and maybe even
       the time) somewhere in the file.  You're writing history of sorts,
       and people who read your file in the future might be interested to
       know when you wrote it (especially if the material stands a chance of
       being outdated in the future and will not apply,  such as some phreak
       info).

     o Write your files on a word processor that will add carriage returns to
       all the lines or at least has word wrap.  That usually solves the
       problem of extra carriage returns between lines which screws up the
       text somewhat.

     Remember,  as an author,  you should be proud of your work.  So take the 
time and effort to format and proofread it before you put it out.  Even if it 
is just a quickie file,  spend a few extra seconds rounding out the rough 
edges to make it at least look respectable.  And you wouldn't want some 
asshole fucking with your files after you put them out,  so don't do it to 
other peoples files.

     I hope some of my ideas catch on.  Even if they don't,  I figure that I 
at least put forth the effort.

     "Hi everyone!  Welcome to the premiere issue of "Book 'Em,"
an informal e-zine that is written especially for bookstore
lovers.  I have been a bookseller for almost four years and I'd
like to share some of my thoughts and experiences with you."
     (I glance at my watch) 
     "If I don't hurry, I'm going to be late for work.  Why don't
you come along with me to "Book 'Em" and we'll chat some more?"  
     (I drive to the store with a caravan of cars following me. 
Upon arriving, I lead everyone through the front door. A large
stack of boxes is being unloaded from a truck) 
     "A lot of you probably think that a bookstore is a quiet,
dull place where the most exciting event of the year is the
delivery of the newest release by John Grisham . . ."
     (I slit open one of the boxes and peek inside)
      "Oh, it's here!  `The Rainmaker'  is here!"  
     (I dance around the store and do cartwheels in the aisles.
Breathlessly, I return to the box, take out a copy, and start to
read.  Someone clears their throat and I look up)
     "Oh, forgive me  . . .  I just had to read the first 
page . . . for selling purposes, you know." 
     (I take the book and place it in the front window and return
to my guests) 
     "Now, what were we discussing . . . oh yes, excitement in a
bookstore . . ."
     (I am interrupted by a crash from the spot where I had just
placed the book)
     "Uh, excuse me for just a moment . . ."   
     (I go over to the window where two old ladies are in a
tug-of-war over "The Rainmaker") 
     "May I help you?" I ask, trying in vain to keep the two
battling biddies apart.
      "I spotted it first, it's mine," biddy number one screams
as she tries to pull the book out of biddy number two's hands.
     "She may have spotted it first, but I got to it before her,"
yells biddy number two. She yanks the book out of the other
biddy's hands and tumbles backward onto the floor. 
     "I got it, it's mine," she cackles with glee, clutching the
war-torn book to her heaving bosom.
     "Ladies, ladies," I manage at last.  "There are plenty of
copies for both of you."
     "She can have that one," biddy number one announces,
straightening her rumpled print dress.  "I don't want my John
dirtied by her grimy fingers."  With a yank to her support
stockings, she strolls off, oblivious to her competitor
who is kissing the back cover photo of John Grisham . . . 
     (Dusting myself off, I return to my guests)
     "Now, let me see if I can think of something exciting  . . . 
hmm . . . well, on occasion we do get to rub elbows with
celebrities. Did I tell you that John Grisham graced our store
with his presence?" 
     (There are a few oohs and aahs)
     "Actually, we only saw his car . . ."  
     (There are a few ohs)
     "Here's the story . . ."


                          A Time To Read

     When I came across John Grisham's e-mail address in the
book, "E-Mail Addresses Of The Rich And Famous," I sent a letter
of admiration and extended an invitation to visit the store at
his convenience.  I received a polite reply informing me that
the person I had written to was not THE AUTHOR, John Grisham. I
read between the lines and realized he was telling me that he WAS
John Grisham but wanted to keep his e-mail address a secret to
protect himself from fanatics, harassers, and other such
admirers.  The name John Grisham was just a cover.  Clever . . . 
     I forgot all about the letter until one day when I noticed a
Mercedes Benz parked across the street with the license plate
GRISHAM.  My heart began to beat in anticipation of HIS arrival. 
I checked the stock level of each Grisham book, hoping we'd have
enough to supply the millions of salivating fans who would line
the streets for miles to obtain an autographed copy of their
favorite title. I discovered that our inventory consisted of two
copies of "A Time To Kill," three copies of "The Firm," three
copies of "The Client," and a whopping six copies of "The
Chamber." That should hold us for about . . . five seconds. 
However, articles of clothing and body parts could be suggested
as alternative autographing material.
     Sweating profusely, knowing HE would emerge from the car at
any second, I debated whether I should alert the local
authorities.  Mass hysteria was liable to break out once the word
spread of his arrival. As I was dialing the police, the Mercedes
pulled into the street and drove off in a cloud of literary dust. 
Disappointed, I tried to console myself with the thought that
perhaps his brief but memorable visit would be noted in a chapter
of his next book . . . "A Time To Read." 


     
     (So close yet so far, I think dreamily.  Suddenly, I realize
that my guests are still here and come back down to earth) 
     "Well, John Grisham may not have actually been IN the store
but O.J. . . ." 
     (My words are cut short by exclamations of "You're kidding!"
and sarcastic remarks such as "What did he buy, a book on
knives!") 
     "EXCUSE ME!"  
     (The commotion dies down) 
     "Thank you." 
     (I continue)
      "O.J. Simpson didn't actually visit but a lovely lady who
is a very good friend of a man who was in love with O.J.'s
brother's wife did and we got to see a picture of her friend
holding a picture of O.J. and Nicole. I nearly fainted from the
thrill of it . . ."
     (I pick up a copy of "I Want To Tell You" and brush my
fingers across O.J.'s face. Someone coughs and I replace the book
on the shelf)   
     "Many of our books deal with current events, such as the
O.J. Simpson trial, so it's important that I keep up-to-date on
what's going on in the outside world.  You may think that
booksellers live in their own little world of fictitious
characters battling evil forces in faraway lands but not me, no
siree.  Why, just the other day when a customer purchased a copy
of Barbara Bush's biography, I told her what a fine job her
husband was DOING as president!" 
     (I smile proudly) 
     "Here are some more examples of why "ESPN" is my middle
name . . ."


                       While I Was Sleeping


     Customers assume that bookstore employees know the name and
author of every book that was published since the stone age. We
are also expected to keep up-to-date on who is writing what and
the exact month, day, and minute it will be out on the shelves.
And of course, we are presumed to be in-the-know on all the
nonfiction titles, authors, and subjects that are hot, hip and in
demand  . . . NOT!
     As most laboring Americans will attest, work tends to leave
little time for the real world. For me, headline news is often an
announcement that there are fifty boxes to unpack rather than who
got shot, flooded, or elected President. America could be seized
by aliens and I'd never know it unless one of them came in the
store and bought a book.  So, sometimes you just have to fake
your knowledgeability . . . 
     "Do you have Faye Resnick's book?" a man asked me last
November. 
     I stood there for a moment, trying to place the name.  I
knew that I had heard it somewhere as it sounded very familiar.
     "Is that a local author?" I asked.  I almost crawled beneath
a shelf when the man replied:
     "She's the author of the Nicole Brown Simpson book."
I vowed never to let myself be embarrassed like that again . . .  
     "Do you have the book, `Sins Of The Mother'?" asked a
couple, two months later.
     I pondered the title for a second, hoping that something
would click in my mind. Finally, I opened my mouth and said:
     "That's fiction, right?"
     "It's the book by Susan Smith, the South Carolina mother who
drowned her two little boys," the woman replied. I excused myself
and hid in the bathroom until they left.
     If I this ever happens again, I just tell everyone that I've
been conducting research on plant growth in Antarctica . . .


    (I peek my head outside the bathroom door) 
     "Is it safe to come out?"
     (Someone nods and I emerge and pick up a stack of books) 
     "Well, folks, I'd love to gab some more but my boss wants me
to build a prison cell out of `The Chamber.'"  I've really
enjoyed sharing a little of my "book life" with you.  Why don't
you come back next month and I'll tell you another fascinating
story or two. 
     To remember the name of this e-zine, just think of any
police officer on television and the words that he or she says as
they handcuff the bad guy . . . Book 'Em."

                                        New Story
=========================================================================================

There are two stories to this famous legend, of the two I know not which is
true. So lean back, fall off your chair, and break your neck while hitting your
head on the floor. And read.

  One day, when I was living on a farm, with my parents and many of the farm
animals, I was once called upon to go out and sell our cows in town for money.
A weird-looking man came up to me, offering beans that were said to be MAGICAL!
"No way!" I said.  "I'm not that stupid!" I continued my way to town.

  I succeeded in selling two of the three cows, but that was OK, I thought,
because we would still need one for milk and other things.  While I was buying
things in town, I let the cow graze in the wide open fields bordering the
stores, which, unknown to me, was near a nuclear plant, emanating radiation
into the fields.

  Soon it was time to come home, which I did, and as I led the cow back, I
noticed something unusual about it, but I couldn't tell exactly what it was.
Funny, the sun set over an hour ago, but it still seems bright.  Anyways, it's
a beautiful red sunset.

  That night I slept soundly, and when the next morning came, and I went out to
feed and milk the cow, there was an odd look in the cow's eyes!  Suddenly, it
came up to me and bit me, and in that next second it exploded!

  When I finally regained consciousness, I looked around me and saw a terrible
sight.  The farm, and everything on it, was devastated.  Crops were still
burning from the explosion, and the bodies of my parents sat smoking in the
ashes.  As I looked over the farm, the house, and the bodies, I wept.  I was
scared and I didn't know what to do.  "Why them?" I thought.  "Why not me?
What spared my life?  What did I do to deserve this?"

  Mad at myself and the world, I felt I had to strike out at something to
relieve my anger.  I hit a part of dead tree that was torn off in the
explosion.  The result?  I struck oil.  Puzzled by this and everything that
happened that day, I started to run, and fast.  After about 30 seconds and 3/4
of a mile, I saw, in the distance, a cow explosion.  Suddenly, as if in
realization of what had happened to me, I thought, "I now posses strange
powers, and whenever I use them, a cow explodes.  I can use my powers to help
people, and use them I will.  For I am........

                          The Cow Exploder!(R)
                                              ...and no one is inferior to me."
                          * * * * * * * * * *

  Another story, thought also to be true and to precede this story is as
follows:

  One day, as I was driving home from work (home at that time was simply a
small apartment with $500 a month rent) I noticed a small car on the freeway, a
Volkswagen bug, to be exact, in pretty bad shape, with worn tires, dented
fenders, and a dirty windshield.  However, what struck me as unusual about it
was it's license plate.  It had a bright new California license plate with the
setting sun on it, which read "THE COW".  The reason this struck me as odd was
that why would anyone who had a car as bad as that want to spend that much
money on a license plate?  Maybe they wanted to improve their car, but just
gradually, and they started out with that, meaning to work their way up.  Who
knows?  Anyways, as I was watching it, I saw one of it's tires run over a nail
and blow out.  While the driver pulled over to the side of the freeway,
something suddenly happened to my car also, and I lost control.  For some
reason my car started steering to the side of the freeway, and screeching to a
halt, right next to the other car.

After I got out of the car to see what was wrong, and finding nothing, I
noticed the woman at her car, trying to change the tire, and looking quite
helpless.  I went over to offer my help, but then, for some strange reason, I
had a sudden urge to push her down on the ground and jump on her.  Which I did.
Suddenly, "THE COW" (her car) exploded!

  "You saved my life!" she said.

  "I didn't mean it," I started to say.  "I mean, I never really meant to pull
over in the first.  You see, I seemed to have lost control of my car, and my
car pulled over by itself."

  "Do you expect me to believe that?" she said.  "You saved my life, do you me
to do anything for you?"

  "No, thank you.  I told you it was just coincidence that brought made this
happen in the first place.  I don't want anything." "Yes you do," she said, and
with that I noticed a slight change in her voice.  It became louder, and more
resounding.  Like the guy in the SU 2000 Motor Oil from Shell commercials.
"You wish to return to your childhood, to a time when you had no cares or
responsibilities.  You want a chance to start over again," she said.  "You're
right," I said.  "But a lot of other people have that same wish.  But why are
you telling me this?  You can't do anything about it, and neither can you.  But
why dwell on the past?" "Because it is your destiny, your fate to go back and
start over again.  You enjoy making people happy, and now is a time when many
people need happiness, or at least a feeling that they are at least better than
someone else in this world.  They don't need any more people to look up to and
idolize, that will only make them feel worse.  No, what they need is someone to
be able look down upon and laugh at, and you will be that person." "Thanks
heaps," I said.  "But no thanks.  What's this all about anyways?  Are you sure
you're all right from what happened to your car and everything?  Maybe you hit
your head on the dashboard." "I am perfectly fine.  But I'm not sure about you.
When you wake up you may think this was all a dream, maybe it is.  You may not
remember this, you may not even care, but when you wake up, you will be..."
"Wait, I don't think I belong here!" "I already told you, this is your fate!
You were meant to drive off..." "No, I mean, I thought this was supposed to be
a humorous story, not some- thing out of some wild lunatic's fantasies." "Like
it or not, you're stuck.  Sorry.  But anyways, let me continue..." "No way, I
want out, and NOW!" "You're getting paid $100 a word." "As you were saying..."
"When you wake up, you will become a 14 year old boy.  For you are..." I found
myself repeating her words...  "For I am.....  The Cow Exploder!(R) ...and no
one is inferior to me." (Sorry I repeated that line, but I like it.  It has a
strange ring to it.) Suddenly I woke up, as if from a dream, having the mind
and body of a 14 year old boy, just as she said.  At first I thought it was a
dream, but then, under my pillow, I found $17,600 under my pillow.
Hmmmmmmmmm......I wonder.....

                             * * * * * * * * * *

  The last story is thought by some to precede the first one, but, in any case,
the latter of the two stories is the one most often accepted as true.  In some
small, primitive countries, also, they believe this story to be some kind of
religious literature, and base religions after it.  Unfortunately, there have
been found to be rumors, started by some real jerk.

  For those of you who are interested in knowing, I was not on and type of

                         THE SEVEN OLD SAMURAI

   Once upon a time, in far off Japan, a band of fierce robbers had their 
hiding place on top of a mountain almost always covered with grey clouds, 
windswept and battered by storms. The robbers lived in a large cave where they
had piled their spoils. Now and again, they went down the mountain, attacked a
village, murdered the poor folk they chanced upon, stole whatever they could 
lay hands on and burned it to the ground. Wherever the robbers passed, there 
was nothing but smoking ruins, weeping men and women, misery, mournlng and 
desolation.
   The Emperor, worried at this, had sent his soldiers to attack the mountain,
but the robbers had always managed to drive them off. The Emperor sent for one
of the last remaining Samurai, old Raiko, and said to him:
   "Raiko, you've served me for many years. Do my bidding for one last time. 
Go to the mountain at the head of an army and wipe out these bloodthirsty 
bandits." Raiko sighed.
   "Your Majesty, if I were young again I'd do it alone. Today I'm too old, 
far too old to do that, or to command an army."
   "Must I then," said the Emperor, "submit to the force of these marauding 
robbers?" The old Samurai replied:
   "No, I'll go up there with six Samurai like myself."
   "But if they're all as old as you, how can they help you?"
   "Have faith in us!" said Raiko.
   A few days later, the seven Samurai set off on their journey, not with 
horses, swords, shields and armour, which they could no longer have worn 
anyway, but dressed as humble pilgrims. From the summit, the bandits watched 
them come, and their leader said,
   "Who cares about seven beggars. Let them climb up." The seven reached the 
cave and Raiko humbly said,
   "Let us come in, it's cold outside. There's a wind blowing and we, as you 
can see, are old men. We'll be no trouble to you." The leader of the gang 
scornfully replied:
   "Come in, old men, and stay in a corner." And so. the seven pilgrims 
huddled in a corner while the bandits ate their meal of food stolen from the 
villages nearby.
   Now and again, they threw scraps of food and leftovers to the old men, 
saying: "Eat this, and it is much too good for you." A few hours later, Raiko 
rose to his feet saying:
   "The wind has dropped. We can go on our way. In thanks. for your 
hospitality, we would like to offer you this liqueur, it is sake, rice wine. 
Drink our health with it." The robbers needed no second telling. In the blink 
of an eye, they had emptied the goatskin bottle Raika held out to them. And in
the blink of an eye they all lay dead, for the sake contained a very potent 
poison. And so, the seven Samurai, too old to wield a sword, served the 
Emperor for the last time.

LETTER_TO_SYMPSON                                                           
  A LETTER FROM CAPTAIN GULLIVER TO HIS COUSIN SYMPSON                      
-                                                                           
  I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be           
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on      
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with        
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put          
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my        
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not           
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,      
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to           
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;                    
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of          
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem         
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,          
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it      
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master         
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my             
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,        
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the      
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of         
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,      
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of        
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some           
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,         
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you            
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you          
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful      
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every          
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But         
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about          
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of      
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time        
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under          
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very         
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,         
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous         
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement            
hither.                                                                     
  Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,           
and to the trust I reposed in you.                                          
  I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,        
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of           
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my         
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired        
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;            
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of              
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for               
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at         
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,             
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath            
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you        
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were                  
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and               
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing          
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely          
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in            
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great            
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning              
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned          
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with           
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly            
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly             
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned      
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and          
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable        
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been      
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the           
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,      
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself        
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human            
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of          
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those           
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not          
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author          
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.                                   
  I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to             
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and         
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of      
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since        
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I         
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there         
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but             
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to              
adjust it as they please.                                                   
  I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as         
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my           
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest            
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found          
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled      
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I           
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so        
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when         
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,      
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner            
intelligible to the other.                                                  
                                            {LETTER_TO_SYMPSON ^paragraph 5}
  If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have           
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think          
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone        
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more         
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.                                   
  Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,                 
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not                
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any         
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have        
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every        
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of      
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,             
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from         
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a        
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not           
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of          
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate            
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they      
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.          
  Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far              
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well             
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example      
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years             
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that              
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so         
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the           
Europeans.                                                                  
  I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but         
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely                
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature      
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and            
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else      
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming      
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary      
schemes for ever.

  THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER                                               
-                                                                           
  The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient           
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the      
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of         
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,      
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in      
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet        
in good esteem among his neighbors.                                         
  Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his              
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from                 
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at         
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.      
  Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following           
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should         
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is          
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the               
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.      
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the         
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of      
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,      
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.                      
  By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the                
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to          
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some             
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common          
scribbles of politics and party.                                            
  This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not         
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and      
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several             
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of         
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of        
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend            
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved          
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of              
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me      
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any         
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came

  CHAPTER I                                                                 
-                                                                           
  My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the third          
of five sons. He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen        
years old, where I resided three years, and applied myself close to my      
studies: but the charge of maintaining me (although I had a very            
scanty allowance) being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound         
apprentice to Mr. James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom      
I continued four years; and my father now and then sending me small         
sums of money, I laid them out in learning navigation, and other parts      
of the mathematics, useful to those who intend to travel, as I              
always believed it would be some time or other my fortune to do.            
When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my father; where, by the              
assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other relations, I got        
forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain me          
at Leyden: there I studied physic two years and seven months,               
knowing it would be useful in long voyages.                                 
  Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended, by my good           
master Mr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham             
Pannell commander; with whom I continued three years and a half,            
making a voyage or two into the Levant, and some other parts. When I        
came back, I resolved to settle in London, to which Mr. Bates, my           
master, encouraged me, and by him I was recommended to several              
patients. I took part of a small house in the Old Jury; and being           
advised to alter my condition, I married Mrs. Mary Burton, second           
daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier, in Newgate-street, with whom         
I received four hundred pounds for a portion.                               
  But, my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few      
friends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer      
me to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren. Having        
therefore consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I            
determined to go again to sea. I was surgeon successively in two            
ships, and made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West        
Indies, by which I got some addition to my fortune. My hours of             
leisure I spent in reading the best authors, ancient and modern, being      
always provided with a good number of books; and when I was ashore, in      
observing the manners and dispositions of the people, well as learning      
their language, wherein I had a great facility by the strength of my        
memory.                                                                     
  The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary        
of the sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family. I         
removed from the Old jury to Fetter-Lane, and from thence to Wapping        
hoping to get business among the sailors; but it would not turn to          
account. After three years expectation that things would mend, I            
accepted an advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, master        
of the Antelope, who was making a voyage to the South-Sea. We set sail      
from Bristol May 4, 1699, and our voyage at first was very prosperous.      
  It would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with      
the particulars of our adventures in those seas: let it suffice to          
inform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we          
were driven by a violent storm to the northwest of Van Diemen's             
Land. By an observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30           
degrees 2 minutes south. Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate         
labor and ill food, the rest were in a very weak condition. On the          
fifth of November, which was the beginning of summer in those parts,        
the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock, within half a         
cable's length of the ship; but the wind was so strong, that we were        
driven directly upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew, of         
whom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to      
get clear of the ship, and the rock. We rowed by my computation             
about three leagues, till we were able to work no longer, being             
already spent with labor while we were in the ship. We therefore            
trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour      
the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north. What became of      
my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on the           
rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they          
were all lost. For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was      
pushed forward by wind and tide. I often let my legs drop, and could        
feel no bottom: but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no         
longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was      
much abated. The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile          
before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o'clock      
in the evening. I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could         
not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so        
weak a condition, that I did not observe them. I was extremely              
tired, and with that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a         
pint of brandy that I drank as I left the ship, I found myself much         
inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass, which was very short and        
soft, where I slept sounder than ever I remember to have done in my         
life, and, as I reckoned, above nine hours; for when I awakened, it         
was just daylight. I attempted to rise, but was not able to stir            
for, as I happened to he on my back, I found my arms and legs were          
strongly fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was        
long and thick, tied down in the same manner. I likewise felt               
several slender ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my             
thighs. I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and           
the light offended my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me, but          
in the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky. In a little         
time I felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing          
gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when bending      
my eyes downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human          
creature not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a      
quiver at his back. In the meantime, I felt at least forty more of the      
same kind (as I conjectured) following the first. I was in the              
utmost astonishment, and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a        
fright; and some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the      
falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground. However, they      
soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full        
sight of my face, lifting up his hands and eyes by way of                   
admiration, cried out in a shrill but distinct voice, Hekinah degul:        
the others repeated the same words several times, but I then knew           
not what they meant. I lay all this while, as the reader may                
believe, in great uneasiness: at length, struggling to get loose, I         
had the fortune to break the strings, and wrench out the pegs that          
fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by lifting it up to my             
face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind me, and at the        
same time, with a violent pull, which gave me excessive pain, I a           
little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left side,        
so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. But the           
creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them;                 
whereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after        
it ceased, I heard one of them cry aloud, Tolgo phonac; when in an          
instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand,           
which pricked me like so many needles; and besides they shot another        
flight into the air, as we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I              
suppose, fell on my body (though I felt them not) and some on my face,      
which I immediately covered with my left hand. When this shower of          
arrows was over, I fell a groaning with grief and pain, and then            
striving again to get loose, they discharged another volley larger          
than the first, and some of them attempted with spears to stick me          
in the sides; but, by good luck, I had on me a buff jerkin, which they      
could not pierce. I thought it the most prudent method to lie still,        
and my design was to continue so till night, when, my left hand             
being already loose, I could easily free myself: and as for the             
inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for the             
greatest armies they could bring against me, if they were all of the        
same size with him that I saw. But fortune disposed otherwise of me.        
When the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more               
arrows; but, by the noise I heard, I knew their numbers increased; and      
about four yards from me, over against my right ear, I heard a              
knocking for above an hour, like that of people at work; when               
turning my head that way, as well as the pegs and strings would permit      
me, I saw a stage erected, about a foot and a half from the ground,         
capable of holding four of the inhabitants, with two or three               
ladders to mount it: from whence one of them, who seemed to be a            
person of quality, made me a long speech, whereof I understood not one      
syllable. But I should have mentioned, that before the principal            
person began his oration, he cried out three times, Langro dehul san        
(these words and the former were afterwards repeated and explained          
to me). Whereupon immediately about fifty of the inhabitants came, and      
cut the strings that fastened the left side of my head, which gave          
me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of observing the person      
and gesture of him that was to speak. He appeared to be of a middle         
age, and taller than any of the other three who attended him,               
whereof one was a page that held up his train, and seemed to be             
somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other two stood one on each      
side to support him. He acted every part of an orator, and I could          
observe many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity,         
and kindness. I answered in a few words, but in the most submissive         
manner, lifting up my left hand and both my eyes to the sun, as             
calling him for a witness; and being almost famished with hunger,           
having not eaten a morsel for some hours before I left the ship, I          
found the demands of nature so strong upon me, that I could not             
forbear showing my impatience (perhaps against the strict rules of          
decency) by putting my finger frequently on my mouth, to signify            
that I wanted food. The Hurgo (for so they call a great lord, as I          
afterwards learned) understood me very well. He descended from the          
stage, and commanded that several ladders should be applied to my           
sides, on which above a hundred of the inhabitants mounted, and walked      
towards my mouth, laden with baskets full of meat, which had been           
provided, and sent thither by the King's orders, upon the first             
intelligence he received of me. I observed there was the flesh of           
several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste. There         
were shoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and very      
well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate them by           
two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the      
bigness of musket bullets. They supplied me as they could, showing a        
thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and appetite. I        
then made another sign that I wanted drink. They found by my eating         
that a small quantity would not suffice me, and being a most ingenious      
people, they slung up with great dexterity one of their largest             
hogsheads, then rolled it toward my hand, and beat out the top; I           
drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not            
hold half a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much        
more delicious. They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in         
the same manner, and made signs for more, but they had none to give         
me. When I had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and           
danced upon my breast, repeating several times as they did at first,        
Hekinah degul. They made me a sign that I should throw down the two         
hogsheads, but first warning the people below to stand out of the way,      
crying aloud, Borach mivola, and when they saw the vessels in the air,      
there was a universal shout of Hekinah degul. I confess I was often         
tempted, while they were passing backwards and forwards on my body, to      
seize forty or fifty of the first that came in my reach, and dash them      
against the ground. But the remembrance of what I had felt, which           
probably might not be the worst they could do, and the promise of           
honor I made them, for so I interpreted my submissive behavior, soon        
drove out these imaginations. Besides, I now considered myself as           
bound by the laws of hospitality to a people who had treated me with        
so much expense and magnificence. However, in my thoughts I could           
not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive              
mortals, who dare venture to mount and walk upon my body, while one of      
my hands was at liberty, without trembling at the very sight of so          
prodigious a creature as I must appear to them. After some time,            
when they observed that I made no more demands for meat, there              
appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty.         
His Excellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg,                
advanced forwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue.         
And producing his credentials under the Signet Royal, which he applied      
close to my eyes, spoke about ten minutes, without any signs of anger,      
but with a kind of determinate resolution; often pointing forwards,         
which, as I afterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half      
a mile distant, whither it was agreed by his Majesty in council that I      
must be conveyed. I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made      
a sign with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but            
over his Excellency's head, for fear of hurting him or his train)           
and then to my own head and body, to signify that I desired my              
liberty. It appeared that he understood me well enough, for he shook        
his head by way of disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to        
show that I must be carried as a prisoner. However, he made other           
signs to let me understand that I should have meat and drink enough,        
and very good treatment. Whereupon I once more thought of attempting        
to break my bonds, but again, when I felt the smart of their arrows         
upon my face and hands, which were all in blisters, and many of the         
darts still sticking in them, and observing likewise that the number        
of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let them know that they           
might do with me what they pleased. Upon this the Hurgo and his             
train withdrew with much civility and cheerful countenances. Soon           
after I heard a general shout, with frequent repetitions of the words,      
Peplom selan, and I felt great numbers of the people on my left side        
relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was able to turn upon my        
right, and to ease myself with making water; which I very                   
plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the who conjecturing          
by my motions what I was going to do, immediately opened to the             
right and left on that side, to avoid the torrent which fell with such      
noise and violence from me. But before this, they had daubed my face        
and both my hands with a sort of ointment very pleasant to the              
smell, which in a few minutes removed all the smart of their arrows.        
These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by             
their victuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to        
sleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and          
it was no wonder, for the physicians, by the Emperor's order, had           
mingled a sleepy potion in the hogsheads of wine.                           
                                                     {P_1|CH_1 ^paragraph 5}
  It seems that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the      
ground after my landing, the Emperor had early notice of it by an           
express; and determined in council that I should be tied in the manner      
I have related (which was done in the night while I slept), that            
plenty of meat and drink should be sent me, and a machine prepared          
to carry me to the capital city.                                            
  This resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am      
confident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like         
occasion; however, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as      
generous. For supposing these people had endeavored to kill me with         
their spears and arrows while I was asleep, I should certainly have         
awakened with the first sense of smart, which might so far have roused      
my rage and strength, as to have enabled me to break the strings            
wherewith I was tied; after which, as they were not able to make            
resistance, so they could expect no mercy.                                  
  These people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to great      
perfection in mechanics by the countenance and encouragement of the         
Emperor, who is a renowned patron of learning. This prince has several      
machines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees and other great          
weights. He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine      
feet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried        
on these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea. Five               
hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to            
prepare the greatest engine they had. It was a frame of wood raised         
three inches from the ground, about seven feet long and four wide,          
moving upon twenty-two wheels. The shout I heard was upon the               
arrival of this engine, which it seems set out in four hours after          
my landing. It was brought parallel to me as I lay. But the                 
principal difficulty was to raise and place me in this vehicle. Eighty      
poles, each of one foot high, were erected for this purpose, and            
very strong cords of the bigness of packthread were fastened by             
hooks to many bandages, which the workmen had girt round my neck, my        
hands, my body, and my legs. Nine hundred of the strongest men were         
employed to draw up these cords by many pulleys fastened on the poles,      
and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised and slung into the         
engine, and there tied fast. All this I was told, for while the             
whole operation was performing, I lay in a profound sleep, by the           
force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor. Fifteen         
hundred of the Emperor's largest horses, each about four inches and         
a half high, were employed to draw me towards the metropolis, which,        
as I said, was half a mile distant.                                         
  About four hours after we began our journey, I awaked by a very           
ridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped a while to              
adjust something that was out of order, two or three of the young           
natives had the curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep;            
they climbed up into the engine, and advancing very softly to my face,      
one of them, an officer in the Guards, put the sharp end of his             
half-pike a good way up into my left nostril, which tickled my nose         
like a straw, and made me sneeze violently: whereupon they stole off        
unperceived, and it was three weeks before I knew the cause of my           
awaking so suddenly. We made a long march the remaining part of that        
day, and rested at night with five hundred guards on each side of           
me, half with torches, and half with bows and arrows, ready to shoot        
me if I should offer to stir. The next morning at sunrise we continued      
our march, and arrived within two hundred yards of the city gates           
about noon. The Emperor, and all his court, came out to meet us; but        
his great officers would by no means suffer his Majesty to endanger         
his person by mounting on my body.                                          
  At the place where the carriage stopped, there stood an ancient           
temple, esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom, which              
having been polluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was,         
according to the zeal of those people, looked on as profane, and            
therefore had been applied to common uses, and all the ornaments and        
furniture carried away. In this edifice it was determined I should          
lodge. The great gate fronting to the north was about four feet             
high, and almost two feet wide, through which I could easily creep. On      
each side of the gate was a small window not above six inches from the      
ground: into that on the left side, the King's smiths conveyed              
fourscore and eleven chains, like those that hang to a lady's watch in      
Europe, and almost as large, which were locked to my left leg with six      
and thirty padlocks. Over against this temple, on the other side of         
the great highway, at twenty feet distance, there was a turret at           
least five feet high. Here the Emperor ascended with many principal         
lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me, as I was          
told, for I could not see them. It was reckoned that above a hundred        
thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand; and in      
spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten             
thousand, at several times, who mounted upon my body by the help of         
ladders. But a proclamation was soon issued to forbid it upon pain          
of death. When the workmen found it was impossible for me to break          
loose, they cut all the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up          
with as melancholy a disposition as ever I had in my life. But the          
noise and astonishment of the people at seeing me rise and walk, are        
not to be expressed. The chains that held my left leg were about two        
yards long, and gave me not only the liberty of walking backwards           
and forwards in a semi-circle; but, being fixed within four inches          
of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and lie at my full length in           
the temple.                                                                 
                                                                            
P_1|CH_2                                                                    
  CHAPTER II                                                                
-                                                                           
  When I found myself on my feet, I looked about me, and must               
confess I never beheld a more entertaining prospect. The country round      
appeared like a continued garden, and the inclosed fields, which            
were generally forty feet square, resembled so many beds of flowers.        
These fields were intermingled with woods of half a sting, and the          
tallest trees, as I could judge, appeared to be seven feet high. I          
viewed the town on my left hand, which looked like the painted scene        
of a city in a theatre.                                                     
  I had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of         
nature; which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last      
unburdened myself. I was under great difficulties between urgency           
and shame. The best expedient I could think of, was to creep into my        
house, which I accordingly did; and shutting the gate after me, I went      
as far as the length of my chain would suffer, and discharged my            
body of that uneasy load. But this was the only time I was ever guilty      
of so uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid           
reader will give some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially      
considered my case, and the distress I was in. From this time my            
constant practice was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business          
in open air, at the full extent of my chain, and due care was taken         
every morning before company came, that the offensive matter should be      
carried off in wheelbarrows, by two servants appointed for that             
purpose. I would not have dwelt so long upon a circumstance, that           
perhaps at first sight may appear not very momentous, if I had not          
thought it necessary to justify my character in point of cleanliness        
to the world; which I am told some of my maligners have been                
pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call in question.                
  When this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house,           
having occasion for fresh air. The Emperor was already descended            
from the tower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had            
like to have cost him dear; for the beast, though very well trained,        
yet wholly unused to such a sight, which appeared as if a mountain          
moved before him, he reared up on his hinder feet: but that prince,         
who is an excellent horseman, kept his seat, till his attendants ran        
in, and held the bridle, while his Majesty had time to dismount.            
When he alighted, he surveyed me round with great admiration, but kept      
without the length of my chain. He ordered his cooks and butlers,           
who were already prepared, to give me victuals and drink, which they        
pushed forward in a sort of vehicle upon wheels till I could reach          
them. I took these vehicles, and soon emptied them all; twenty of them      
were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each of the former              
afforded me two or three good mouthfuls, and I emptied the liquor of        
ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one vehicle,        
drinking it off at a draught; and so I did with the rest. The Empress,      
and young Princes of the blood, of both sexes, attended by many             
ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident         
that happened to the Emperor's horse, they alighted, and came near his      
person, which I am now going to describe. He is taller by almost the        
breadth of my nail than any of his court, which alone is enough to          
strike an awe into the beholders. His features are strong and               
masculine, with an Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive,      
his countenance erect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his        
motions graceful, and his deportment majestic. He was then past his         
prime, being twenty-eight years and three quarters old, of which he         
had reigned about seven, in great felicity, and generally                   
victorious. For the better convenience of beholding him, I lay on my        
side, so that my face was parallel to his, and he stood but three           
yards off: however, I have had him since many times in my hand, and         
therefore cannot be deceived in the description. His dress was very         
plain and simple, and the fashion of it between the Asiatic and the         
European; but he had on his head a light helmet of gold, adorned            
with jewels, and a plume on the crest. He held his sword drawn in           
his hand, to defend himself, if I should happen to break loose; it was      
almost three inches long, the hilt and scabbard were gold enriched          
with diamonds. His voice was shrill, but very clear and articulate,         
and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up. The ladies and              
courtiers were all most magnificently clad, so that the spot they           
stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread on the ground,             
embroidered with figures of gold and silver. His Imperial Majesty           
spoke often to me, and I returned answers, but neither of us could          
understand a syllable. There were several of his priests and lawyers        
present (as I conjectured by their habits) who were commanded to            
address themselves to me, and I spoke to them in as many languages          
as I had the least smattering of, which were High and Low Dutch,            
Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, and Lingua Franca; but all to no           
purpose. After about two hours the court retired, and I was left            
with a strong guard, to prevent the impertinence, and probably the          
malice of the rabble, who were very impatient to crowd about me as          
near as they dare, and some of them had the impudence to shoot their        
arrows at me as I sat on the ground by the door of my house, whereof        
one very narrowly missed my left eye. But the colonel ordered six of        
the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no punishment so proper as        
to deliver them bound into my hands, which some of his soldiers             
accordingly did, pushing them forwards with the butt-ends of their          
pikes into my reach; I took them all in my right hand, put five of          
them into my coat pocket, and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as      
if I would eat him alive. The poor man squalled terribly, and the           
colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw        
me take out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking      
mildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set        
him gently on the ground, and away he ran. I treated the rest in the        
same manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket, and I observed        
both the soldiers and people were highly obliged at this mark of my         
clemency, which was represented very much to my advantage at court.         
  Towards night I with some difficulty got into my house, where I           
lay on the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during         
which time the Emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me.           
Six hundred beds of the common measure were brought in carriages,           
and worked up in my house; a hundred and fifty of their beds sewn           
together made up the breadth and length, and these were four double,        
which however kept me but very indifferently from the hardness of           
the floor, that was of smooth stone. By the same computation they           
provided me with sheets, blankets, and coverlets, tolerable enough for      
one who had been so long inured to hardships as I.                          
  As the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought          
prodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so          
that the villages were almost emptied, and great neglect of tillage         
and household affairs must have ensued, if his Imperial Majesty had         
not provided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against         
this inconveniency. He directed that those who had already beheld me        
should return home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my        
house without license from court; whereby the secretaries of state got      
considerable fees.                                                          
                                                     {P_1|CH_2 ^paragraph 5}
  In the meantime, the Emperor held frequent councils to debate what        
course should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a           
particular friend, a person of great quality, who was looked upon to        
be as much in the secret as any, that the court was under many              
difficulties concerning me. They apprehended my breaking loose, that        
my diet would be very expensive, and might cause a famine. Sometimes        
they determined to starve me, or at least to shoot me in the face           
and hands with poisoned arrows, which would soon dispatch me: but           
again they considered, that the stench of so large a carcass might          
produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread through the         
whole kingdom. In the midst of these consultations, several officers        
of the army went to the door of the great council chamber; and two          
of them being admitted, gave an account of my behavior to the six           
criminals above mentioned, which made so favorable an impression in         
the breast of his Majesty and the whole board in my behalf, that an         
Imperial Commission was issued out, obliging all the villages nine          
hundred yards round the city, to deliver in every morning six               
beeves, forty sheep, and other victuals for my sustenance; together         
with a proportionable quantity of bread, and wine, and other liquors        
for the due payment of which his Majesty gave assignments upon his          
treasury. For this prince lives chiefly upon his own demesnes, seldom,      
except upon great occasions, raising any subsidies upon his                 
subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at their own              
expense. An establishment was-also made of six hundred persons to be        
my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance, and        
tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door. It was      
likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit          
of clothes after the fashion of the country: that six of his Majesty's      
greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language:      
and, lastly, that the Emperor's horses, and those of the nobility, and      
troops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my sight, to            
accustom themselves to me. All these orders were duly put in                
execution, and in about three weeks I made a great progress in              
learning their language; during which time the Emperor frequently           
honored me with his visits, and was pleased to assist my masters in         
teaching me. We began already to converse together in some sort; and        
the first words I learned were to express my desire that he would           
please give me my liberty, which I every day repeated on my knees. His      
answer, as I could apprehend it, was, that this must be a work of           
time, not to be thought on without the advice of his council, and that      
first I must Lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon Emposo; that is, swear a         
peace with him and his kingdom. However, that I should be used with         
all kindness; and he advised me to acquire, by my patience and              
discreet behavior, the good opinion of himself and his subjects. He         
desired I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to certain proper        
officers to search me; for probably I might carry about me several          
weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered the         
bulk of so prodigious a person. I said, his Majesty should be               
satisfied, for I was ready to strip myself, and turn out my pockets         
before him. This I delivered part in words, and part in signs. He           
replied, that by the laws of the kingdom I must be searched by two          
of his officers; that he knew this could not be done without my             
consent and assistance; that he had so good an opinion of my                
generosity and justice, as to trust their persons in my hands: that         
whatever they took from me should be returned when I left the country,      
or paid for at the rate which I would set upon them. I took up the two      
officers in my hands, put them first into my coat-pockets, and then         
into every other pocket about me, except my two fobs, and another           
secret pocket I had no mind should be searched, wherein I had some          
little necessaries that were of no consequence to any but myself. In        
one of my fobs there was a silver watch, and in the other a small           
quantity of gold in a purse. These gentlemen, having pen, ink, and          
paper about them, made an exact inventory of everything they saw;           
and when they were through, desired I would set them down, that they        
might deliver it to the Emperor. This inventory I afterwards                
translated that into English, and is word for word as follows.              
-                                                                           
  Imprimis, In the right coat pocket of the Great Man Mountain (for so      
I interpret the words Quinbus Flestrin) after the strictest search, we      
found only one great piece of coarse cloth, large enough to be a            
foot cloth for your Majesty's chief room of state. In the left              
pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same metal,          
which we the searchers were not able to lift. We desired it should          
be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid      
leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our faces, set        
us both sneezing for several times together. In his right waistcoat         
pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin substances, folded        
one over another, about the bigness of three men, tied with a strong        
cable, and marked with black figures; which we humbly conceive to be        
writings, every letter almost half as large as the palm of our              
hands. In the left there was a sort of engine, from the back of             
which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the palisades before      
your Majesty's court; wherewith we conjecture the Man-Mountain combs        
his head, for we did not always trouble him with questions, because we      
found it a great difficulty to make him understand us. In the large         
pocket on the right side of his middle cover (so I translate the            
word ranfu-lo, by which they meant my breeches) we saw a hollow pillar      
of iron, about the length of a man, fastened to a strong piece of           
timber, larger than the pillar; and upon one side of the pillar were        
huge pieces of iron sticking out, cut into strange figures, which we        
know not what to make of. In the left pocket, another engine of the         
same kind. In the smaller pocket on the right side, were several round      
flat pieces of white and red metal, of different bulk; some of the          
white, which seemed to be silver, were so large and heavy, that my          
comrade and I could hardly lift them. In the left pocket were two           
black pillars irregularly shaped: we could not, without difficulty,         
reach the top of them as we stood at the bottom of his pocket. One          
of them was covered, and seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end        
of the other, there appeared a white round substance, about twice           
the bigness of our heads. Within each of these was enclosed a               
prodigious plate of steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to          
show us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous engines. He         
took them out of their cases, and told us, that in his own country his      
practice was to shave his beard with one of these, and to cut his meat      
with the other. There were two pockets which we could not enter: these      
he called his fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of           
his middle cover, but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly. Out      
of the right fob hung a great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of        
engine at the bottom. We directed him to draw out whatever was              
fastened to that chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and      
half of some transparent metal: for on the transparent side we saw          
certain strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch        
them, till we found our fingers stopped by that lucid substance. He         
put this engine to our ears, which made an incessant noise like that        
of a watermill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal, or      
the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter            
opinion, because he assured us (if we understood him right, for he          
expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did anything             
without consulting it: he called it his oracle, and said it pointed         
out the time for every action of his life. From the left fob he took        
out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open        
and shut like a purse, and serve him for the same use: we found             
therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real        
gold, must be of immense value.                                             
  Having thus, in obedience to your Majesty's commands, diligently          
searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made of      
the hide of some prodigious animal; from which, on the left side, hung      
a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or pouch         
divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of your          
Majesty's subjects. In one of these cells were several globes or balls      
of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads, and              
requiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a            
heap of certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we        
could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands.                   
  This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the         
Man-Mountain, who used us with great civility, and due respect to your      
Majesty's commission. Signed and sealed on the fourth day of the            
eighty-ninth moon of your Majesty's auspicious reign.

                                   Clefren Frelock, Marsi Frelock.          
-                                                                           
-                                                                           
  When this inventory was read over to the Emperor, he directed me,         
although in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several                    
particulars. He first called for my scimitar, which I took out,             
scabbard and all. In the meantime he ordered three thousand of his          
choicest troops (who then attended him) to surround me at a                 
distance, with their bows and arrows just ready to discharge: but I         
did not observe it, for my eyes were wholly fixed upon his Majesty. He      
then desired me to draw my scimitar, which, although it had got some        
rust by the sea water, was in most parts exceeding bright. I did so,        
and immediately all the troops gave a shout between terror and              
surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the reflection dazzled their         
eyes as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my hand. His Majesty, who        
is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted than I could expect; he      
ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and cast it on the ground        
as gently as I could, about six foot from the end of my chain. The          
next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron pillars, by which he      
meant my pocket-pistols. I drew it out, and at his desire, as well          
as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging it only            
with powder, which by the closeness of my pouch happened to escape          
wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent              
mariners take special care to provide) I first cautioned the Emperor        
not to be afraid, and then I let it off in the air. The astonishment        
here was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar. Hundreds            
fell down as if they had been struck dead; and even the Emperor,            
although he stood his ground, could not recover himself in some             
time. I delivered up both my pistols in the same manner as I had            
done my scimitar, and then my pouch of powder and bullets; begging him      
that the former might be kept from the fire, for it would kindle            
with the smallest spark, and blow up his imperial palace into the air.      
I likewise delivered up my watch, which the Emperor was very curious        
to see, and commanded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to            
bear it on a pole upon their shoulders, as draymen in England do a          
barrel of ale. He was amazed at the continual noise it made, and the        
motion of the minute-hand, which he could easily discern; for their         
sight is much more acute than ours; and asked the opinions of his           
learned men about him, which were various and remote, as the reader         
may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could not          
very perfectly understand them. I then gave up my silver and copper         
money, my purse with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones;      
my knife and razor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my handkerchief and       
journal-book. My scimitar, pistols, and pouch, were conveyed in             
carriages to his Majesty's stores; but the rest of my goods were            
returned me.                                                                
  I had, as I before observed, one private pocket which escaped             
their search, wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which I               
sometimes use for the weakness of my eyes), a pocket perspective,           
and several other little conveniences; which, being of no                   
consequence to the Emperor, I did not think myself bound in honor to        
discover, and I apprehended they might be lost or spoiled if I              
ventured them out of my possession.                                         
                                                                            
P_1|CH_3                                                                    
  CHAPTER III                                                               
-                                                                           
  My gentleness and good behavior had gained so far on the Emperor and      
his court, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I           
began to conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time. I            
took all possible methods to cultivate this favorable disposition. The      
natives came by degrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from me.      
I would sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my         
hand. And last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at         
hide and seek in my hair. I had now made good progress in                   
understanding and speaking their language. The Emperor had a mind           
one day to entertain me with several of the country shows, wherein          
they exceeded all nations I have known, both for dexterity and              
magnificence. I was diverted with none so much as that of the               
rope-dancers, performed upon a slender white thread, extended about         
two feet, and twelve inches from the ground. Upon which I shall desire      
liberty, with the reader's patience, to enlarge a little.                   
  This diversion is only practiced by those persons who are candidates      
for great employments and high favors at court. They are trained in         
this art from their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or            
liberal education. When a great office is vacant either by death or         
disgrace (which often happens) five or six of those candidates              
petition the Emperor to entertain his Majesty and the court with a          
dance on the rope, and whoever jumps the highest without falling,           
succeeds in the office. Very often the chief ministers themselves           
are commanded to show their skill, and to convince the Emperor that         
they have not lost their faculty. Flimnap, the Treasurer, is allowed        
to cut a caper on the straight rope, at least an inch higher than           
any other lord in the whole empire. I have seen him do the summerset        
several times together upon a trencher fixed on the rope, which is          
no thicker than a common packthread in England. My friend Reldresal,        
principal Secretary for Private Affairs, is, in my opinion, if I am         
not partial, the second after the Treasurer; the rest of the great          
officers are much upon a par.                                               
  These diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof         
great numbers are on record. I myself have seen two or three                
candidates break a limb. But the danger is much greater when the            
ministers themselves are commanded to show their dexterity; for by          
contending to excell themselves and their fellows, they strain so far,      
that there is hardly one of them who has not received a fall, and some      
of them two or three. I was assured that a year or two before my            
arrival, Flimnap would have infallibly broken his neck, if one of           
the King's cushions, that accidentally lay on the ground, had not           
weakened the force of his fall.                                             
  There is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before           
the Emperor and Empress, and first minister, upon particular                
occasions. The Emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads          
of six inches long. One is blue, the other red, and the third green.        
These threads are proposed as prizes for those persons whom the             
Emperor has a mind to distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favor. The      
ceremony is performed in his Majesty's great chamber of state, where        
the candidates are to undergo a trial of dexterity very different from      
the former, and such as I have not observed the least resemblance of        
in any other country of the old or the new world. The Emperor holds         
a stick in his hands, both ends parallel to the horizon, while the          
candidates, advancing one by one, sometimes leap over the stick,            
sometimes creep under it backwards and forwards several times,              
according as the stick is advanced or depressed. Sometimes the Emperor      
holds one end of the stick, and his first minister the other;               
sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself. Whoever performs         
his part with most agility, and holds out the longest in leaping and        
creeping, is rewarded with the blue-colored silk; the red is given          
to the next, and the green to the third, which they all wear girt           
twice round about the middle; and you see few great persons about this      
court who are not adorned with one of these girdles.                        
  The horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having            
been daily led before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to          
my very feet without starting. The riders would leap them over my hand      
as I held it on the ground, and one of the Emperor's huntsmen, upon         
a large courser, took my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a             
prodigious leap. I had the good fortune to divert the Emperor one           
day after a very extraordinary manner. I desired he would order             
several sticks two feet high, and the thickness of an ordinary cane,        
to be brought me; whereupon his Majesty commanded the master of his         
woods to give directions accordingly; and the next morning six woodmen      
arrived with as many carriages, drawn by eight horses to each. I            
took nine of these sticks, and fixing them firmly in the ground in a        
quadrangular figure, two feet and a half square, I took four other          
sticks, and tied them parallel at each corner, about two feet from the      
ground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that             
stood erect, and extended it on all sides till it was as tight as           
the top of a drum; and the four parallel sticks rising about five           
inches higher than the handkerchief served as ledges on each side.          
When I had finished my work, I desired the Emperor to let a troop of        
his best horse, twentyfour in number, come and exercise upon this           
plain. His Majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up one by      
one in my hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers          
to exercise them. As soon as they got into order, they divided into         
two parties, performed mock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows,            
drew their swords, fled and pursued, attacked and retired, and in           
short discovered the best military discipline I ever beheld. The            
parallel sticks secured them and their horses from falling over the         
stage; and the Emperor was so much delighted, that he ordered this          
entertainment to be repeated several days, and once was pleased to          
be lifted up and give the word of command; and, with great difficulty,      
persuaded even the Empress herself to let me hold her in her close          
chair within two yards of the stage, from whence she was able to            
take a full view of the whole performance. It was my good fortune that      
no ill accident happened in these entertainments, only once a fiery         
horse that belonged to one of the captains pawing with his hoof struck      
a hole in my handkerchief, and his foot slipping, he overthrew his          
rider and himself; but I immediately relieved them both, and                
covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the              
other, in the same manner as I took them up. The horse that fell was        
strained in the left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt, and I             
repaired my handkerchief as well as I could: however I would not trust      
to the strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises.               
                                                     {P_1|CH_3 ^paragraph 5}
  About two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was             
entertaining the court with these kind of feats, there arrived an           
express to inform his Majesty that some of his subjects riding near         
the place where I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance      
lying on the ground, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round as        
wide as his Majesty's bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as            
high as a man; that it was no living creature, as they at first             
apprehended, for it lay on the grass without motion, and some of            
them had walked round it several tunes: that by mounting upon each          
other's shoulders, they had got to the top, which was flat and even,        
and stamping upon it they found it was hollow within; that they humbly      
conceived it might be something belonging to the Man-Mountain, and          
if his Majesty pleased, they would undertake to bring it with only          
five horses. I presently knew what they meant, and was glad at heart        
to receive this intelligence. It seems upon my first reaching the           
shore after our shipwreck, I was in such confusion, that before I came      
to the place where I went to sleep, my hat, which I had fastened            
with a string to my head while I was rowing, and had stuck on all           
the time I was swimming, fell off after I came to land; the string, as      
I conjecture, breaking by some accident which I never observed, but         
thought my hat had been lost at sea. I entreated his Imperial               
Majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as                 
possible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next      
day the wagoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition;         
they had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and a half of the      
edge, and fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by         
a long cord to the harness, and thus my hat was dragged along for           
above half an English mile: but the ground in that country being            
extremely smooth and level, it received less damage than I expected.        
  Two days after this adventure, the Emperor having ordered that            
part of his army which quarters in and about his metropolis to be in a      
readiness, took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular             
manner. He desired I would stand like a Colossus, with my legs as           
far asunder as I conveniently could. He then commanded his General          
(who was an old experienced leader, and a great patron of mine) to          
draw up the troops in close order, and march them under me, the foot        
by twentyfour in a breast, and the horse by sixteen, with drums             
beating, colors flying, and pikes advanced. This body consisted of          
three thousand foot, and a thousand horse. His Majesty gave orders,         
upon pain of death, that every soldier in his march should observe the      
strictest decency with regard to my person; which, however, could           
not prevent some of the younger officers from turning up their eyes as      
they passed under me. And, to confess the truth, my breeches were at        
that time in so ill a condition, that they afforded some opportunities      
for laughter and admiration.                                                
  I had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that           
his Majesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet,           
and then in a full council; where it was opposed by none, except            
Skyresh Bolgolam, who was pleased, without any provocation, to be my        
mortal enemy. But it was carried against him by the whole board, and        
confirmed by the Emperor. That minister was Galbet, or Admiral of           
the Realm, very much in his master's confidence, and a person well          
versed in affairs, but of a morose and sour complexion. However, he         
was at length persuaded to comply; but prevailed that the articles and      
conditions upon which I should be set free, and to which I must swear,      
should be drawn up by himself. These articles were brought to me by         
Skyresh Bolgolam in person, attended by two under-secretaries, and          
several persons of distinction. After they were read, I was demanded        
to swear to the performance of them; first in the manner of my own          
country, and afterwards in the method prescribed by their laws;             
which was to hold my right foot in my left hand, to place the middle        
finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my thumb on the        
tip of my right ear. But because the reader may perhaps be curious          
to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to         
that people, as well as to know the articles upon which I recovered my      
liberty, I have made a translation of the whole instrument word for         
word, as near as I was able, which I here offer to the public.              
-                                                                           
  GOLBASTO MOMAREN EVLAME GURDILO SHEFIN MULLY ULLY GUE, most mighty        
Emperor of Lilliput, delight and terror of the universe, whose              
dominions extend five thousand blustrugs (about twelve miles in             
circumference) to the extremities of the globe; monarch of all              
monarchs, taller than the sons of men; whose feet press down to the         
center, and whose head strikes against the sun; at whose nod the            
princes of the earth shake their knees; pleasant as the spring,             
comfortable as the summer, fruitful as autumn, dreadful as winter. His      
most sublime Majesty proposes to the Man-Mountain, lately arrived to        
our celestial dominions, the following articles, which by a solemn          
oath he shall be obliged to perform.                                        
                                                    {P_1|CH_3 ^paragraph 10}
  First, The Man-Mountain shall not depart from our dominions, without      
our license under our great seal.                                           
  2nd, He shall not presume to come into our metropolis, without our        
express order; at which time the inhabitants shall have two hours           
warning to keep within their doors.                                         
  3rd, The said Man-Mountain shall confine his walks to our                 
principal high roads, and not offer to walk or lie down in a meadow or      
field of corn.                                                              
  4th, As he walks the said roads, he shall take the utmost care not        
to trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects, their             
horses, or carriages, nor take any of our said subjects into his            
hands, without their own consent.                                           
  5th, If an express requires extraordinary dispatch, the Man-Mountain      
shall be obliged to carry in his pocket the messenger and horse a           
six days journey once in every moon, and return the said messenger          
back (if so required) safe to our Imperial Presence.                        
                                                    {P_1|CH_3 ^paragraph 15}
  6th, He shall be our ally against our enemies in the Island of            
Blefuscu, and do his utmost to destroy their fleet, which is now            
preparing to invade us.                                                     
  7th, That the said Man-Mountain shall, at his times of leisure, be        
aiding and assisting to our workmen, in helping to raise certain great      
stones, towards covering the wall of the principal park, and other          
of our royal buildings.                                                     
  8th, That the said Man-Mountain shall, in two moons' time, deliver        
in an exact survey of the circumference of our dominions by a               
computation of his own paces round the coast.                               
   Lastly, That upon his solemn oath to observe all the above               
articles, the said Man-Mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat        
and drink sufficient for the support of 1,728 of our subjects, with         
free access to our Royal Person, and other marks of our favor. Given        
at our Palace at Belfaborac the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon        
of our reign.                                                               
-                                                                           
                                                    {P_1|CH_3 ^paragraph 20}
  I swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and      
content, although some of them were not so honorable as I could have        
wished; which proceeded wholly from the malice of Skyresh Bolgolam the      
High Admiral: whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked, and I was      
at full liberty; the Emperor himself in person did me the honor to          
be by at the whole ceremony. I made my acknowledgments by                   
prostrating myself at his Majesty's feet: but he commanded me to rise;      
and after many gracious expressions, which, to avoid the censure of         
vanity, I shall not repeat, he added, that he hoped I should prove a        
useful servant, and well deserve all the favors he had already              
conferred upon me, or might do for the future.                              
  The reader may please to observe, that in the last article for the        
recovery of my liberty the Emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity        
of meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1,728 Lilliputians.         
Some time after, asking a friend at court how they came to fix on that      
determinate number, he told me that his Majesty's mathematicians,           
having taken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant, and           
finding it to exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one, they        
concluded from the similarity of their bodies, that mine must               
contain at least 1,728 of theirs, and consequently would require as         
much food as was necessary to support that number of Lilliputians.          
By which the reader may conceive an idea of the ingenuity of that           
people, as well as the prudent and exact economy of so great a prince.      
                                                                            
P_1|CH_4                                                                    
  CHAPTER IV                                                                
-                                                                           
  The first request I made after I had obtained my liberty, was,            
that I might have license to see Mildendo, the metropolis, which the        
Emperor easily granted me, but with a special charge to do no hurt          
either to the inhabitants or their houses. The people had notice by         
proclamation of my design to visit the town. The wall which                 
encompassed it is two feet and a half high, and at least eleven inches      
broad, so that a coach and horses may be driven very safely round           
it; and it is flanked with strong towers at ten feet distance. I            
stepped over the great Gate, and passed very gently, and sidering           
through the two principal streets, only in my short waistcoat, for          
fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the houses with the skirts          
of my coat. I walked with the utmost circumspection, to avoid treading      
on any stragglers, that might remain in the streets, although the           
orders were very strict, that all people should keep in their houses        
at their own peril. The garret windows and tops of houses were so           
crowded with spectators, that I thought in all my travels I had not         
seen a more populous place. The city is an exact square, each side          
of the wall being five hundred feet long. The two great streets, which      
run cross and divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide. The         
lanes and alleys, which I could not enter, but only viewed them as I        
passed, are from twelve to eighteen inches. The town is capable of          
holding five hundred thousand souls. The houses are from three to five      
stories. The shops and markets well provided.                               
  The Emperor's palace is in the centre of the city, where the two          
great streets meet. It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and          
twenty feet distant from the buildings. I had his Majesty's permission      
to step over this wall; and the space being so wide between that and        
the palace, I could easily view it on every side. The outward court is      
a square of forty feet, and includes two other courts: in the inmost        
are the royal apartments, which I was very desirous to see, but             
found it extremely difficult; for the great gates, from one square          
into another, were but eighteen inches high and seven inches wide. Now      
the buildings of the outer court were at least five feet high, and          
it was impossible for me to stride over them without infinite damage        
to the pile, though the walls were strongly built of hewn stone, and        
four inches thick. At the same time the Emperor had a great desire          
that I should see the magnificence of his palace; but this I was not        
able to do till three days after, which I spent in cutting down with        
my knife some of the largest trees in the royal park, about a               
hundred yards distant from the city. Of these trees I made two stools,      
each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear my weight. The        
people having received notice a second time, I went again through           
the city to the palace, with my two stools in my hands. When I came to      
the side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool, and took the           
other in my hand: this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it            
down on the space between the first and second court, which was             
eight feet wide. I then stepped over the buildings very conveniently        
from one stool to the other, and drew up the first after me with a          
hooked stick. By this contrivance I got into the inmost court; and          
lying down upon my side, I applied my face to the windows of the            
middle stories, which were left open on purpose, and discovered the         
most splendid apartments that can be imagined. There I saw the Empress      
and the young Princes, in their several lodgings, with their chief          
attendants about them. Her Imperial Majesty was pleased to smile            
very graciously upon me, and gave me out of the window her hand to          
kiss.                                                                       
  But I shall not anticipate the reader with farther descriptions of        
this kind, because I reserve them for a greater work, which is now          
almost ready for the press, containing a general description of this        
empire, from its first erection, through a long series of princes,          
with a particular account of their wars and politics, laws,                 
learning, and religion: their plants and animals, their peculiar            
manners and customs, with other matters very curious and useful; my         
chief design at present being only to relate such events and                
transactions as happened to the public, or to myself, during a              
residence of about nine months in that empire.                              
  One morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty,           
Reldresal, principal Secretary (as they style him) of Private Affairs,      
came to my house attended only by one servant. He ordered his coach to      
wait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hour's audience;        
which I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal        
merits, as well as the many good offices he had done me during my           
solicitations at court. I offered to lie down, that he might the            
more conveniently reach my ear; but he chose rather to let me hold him      
in my hand during our conversation. He began with compliments on my         
liberty; said he might pretend to some merit in it: but, however,           
added, that if it had not been for the present situation of things          
at court, perhaps I might not have obtained it so soon. For, said           
he, as flourishing a condition as we may appear to be in to                 
foreigners, we labor under two mighty evils; a violent faction at           
home, and the danger of an invasion by a most potent enemy from             
abroad. As to the first, you are to understand, that for above seventy      
moons past there have been two struggling parties in this empire,           
under the names of Tramecksan and Slamecksan, from the high and low         
heels on their shoes, by which they distinguish themselves. It is           
alleged indeed, that the high heels are most agreeable to our               
ancient constitution: but however this be, his Majesty has                  
determined to make use of only low heels in the administration of           
the government, and all offices in the gift of the Crown, as you            
cannot but observe; and particularly, that his Majesty's Imperial           
heels are lower at least by a drurr than any of his court; (drurr is a      
measure about the fourteenth part of an inch). The animosities between      
these two parties run so high, that they will neither eat nor drink,        
nor talk with each other. We compute the Tramecksan, or High-Heels, to      
exceed us in number; but the power is wholly on our side. We apprehend      
his Imperial Highness, the Heir to the Crown, to have some tendency         
towards the High-Heels; at least we can plainly discover one of his         
heels higher than the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait.          
Now, in the midst of these intestine disquiets, we are threatened with      
an invasion from the Island of Blefuscu, which is the other great           
empire of the universe, almost as large and powerful as this of his         
Majesty. For as to what we have heard you affirm, that there are other      
kingdoms and states in the world inhabited by human creatures as large      
as yourself, our philosophers are in much doubt, and would rather           
conjecture that you dropped from the moon, or one of the stars;             
because it is certain, that a hundred mortals of your bulk would, in a      
short time, destroy all the fruits and cattle of his Majesty's              
dominions. Besides, our histories of six thousand moons make no             
mention of any other regions, than the two great empires of Lilliput        
and Blefuscu. Which two mighty powers have, as I was going to tell          
you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for six and thirty moons          
past. It began upon the following occasion. It is allowed on all            
hands, that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them,         
was upon the larger end: but his present Majesty's grandfather,             
while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it according          
to the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers. Whereupon      
the Emperor his father published an edict, commanding all his               
subjects, upon great penalties, to break the smaller end of their           
eggs. The people so highly resented this law, that our histories            
tell us there have been six rebellions raised on that account; wherein      
one Emperor lost his life, and another his crown. These civil               
commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of Blefuscu; and        
when they were quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge to that           
empire. It is computed, that eleven thousand persons have, at               
several times, suffered death, rather than submit to break their            
eggs at the smaller end. Many hundred large volumes have been               
published upon this controversy: but the books of the Big-Endians have      
been long forbidden, and the whole party rendered incapable by law          
of holding employments. During the course of these troubles, the            
Emperors of Blefuscu did frequently expostulate by their                    
ambassadors, accusing us of making a schism in religion, by                 
offending against a fundamental doctrine of our great prophet Lustrog,      
in the fifty-fourth chapter of the Blundecral (which is their however,      
is thought to be a mere strain upon the text: for the words are these;      
That all true believers shall break their eggs at the convenient            
end: and which is the convenient end, seems, in my humble opinion,          
to be left to every man's conscience, or at least in the power of           
the chief magistrate to determine. Now the Big-Endian exiles have           
found so much credit in the Emperor of Blefuscu's court, and so much        
private assistance and encouragement from their party here at home,         
that a bloody war has been carried on between the two empires for           
six and thirty moons with various success; during which time we have        
lost forty capital ships, and a much greater number of smaller              
vessels, together with thirty thousand of our best seamen and               
soldiers; and the damage received by the enemy is reckoned to be            
somewhat greater than ours. However, they have now equipped a numerous      
fleet, and are just preparing to make a descent upon us; and his            
Imperial Majesty, placing great confidence in your valor and strength,      
has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before you.             
  I desired the Secretary to present my humble duty to the Emperor,         
and to let him know, that I thought it would not become me, who was         
a foreigner, to interfere with parties; but I was ready, with the           
hazard of my life, to defend his person and state against all               
invaders.                                                                   
                                                                            
P_1|CH_5                                                                    
  CHAPTER V                                                                 
-                                                                           
  The Empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the                       
north-northeast side of Lilliput, from whence it is parted only by a        
channel of eight hundred yards wide. I had not yet seen it, and upon        
this notice of an intended invasion, I avoided appearing on that            
side of the coast, for fear of being discovered by some of the enemy's      
ships, who had received no intelligence of me, all intercourse between      
the two empires having been strictly forbidden during the war, upon         
pain of death, and an embargo laid by our Emperor upon all vessels          
whatsoever. I communicated to his Majesty a project I had formed of         
seizing the enemy's whole fleet: which, as our scouts assured us,           
lay at anchor in the harbor ready to sail with the first fair wind.         
I consulted the most experienced seamen, upon the depth of the              
channel, which they had often plumbed, who told me, that in the middle      
at high-water it was seventy glumgluffs deep, which is about six            
feet of European measure; and the rest of it fifty glumgluffs at most.      
I walked towards the northeast coast over against Blefuscu; and             
lying down behind a hillock, took out my small pocket perspective           
glass, and viewed the enemy's fleet at anchor, consisting of about          
fifty men of war, and a great number of transports; I then came back        
to my house, and gave order (for which I had a warrant) for a great         
quantity of the strongest cable and bars of iron. The cable was             
about as thick as packthread, and the bars of the length and size of a      
knitting needle. I trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for           
the same reason I twisted three of the iron bars together, binding the      
extremities into a hook. Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many           
cables, I went back to the northeast coast, and putting off my coat,        
shoes, and stockings, walked into the sea in my leather jerkin,             
about half an hour before high water. I waded with what haste I could,      
and swam in the middle about thirty yards till I felt ground; I             
arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The enemy was so            
frighted when they saw me, that they leaped out of their ships, and         
swam to shore, where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand          
souls. I then took my tackling, and fastening a hook to a hole at           
the prow of each, I tied all the cords together at the end. While I         
was thus employed, the enemy discharged several thousand arrows,            
many of which stuck in my hands and face; and besides the excessive         
smart, gave me much disturbance in my work. My greatest apprehension        
was for my eyes, which I should have infallibly lost, if I had not          
suddenly thought of an expedient. I kept among other little                 
necessaries a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I           
observed before, had escaped the Emperor's searchers. These I took out      
and fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed            
went on boldly with my work in spite of the enemy's arrows, many of         
which struck against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any          
other effect, further than a little to discompose them. I now fastened      
all the hooks, and taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but           
not a ship would stir, for they were all too fast held by their             
anchors, so that the boldest part of my enterprise remained. I              
therefore let go the cord, and leaving the hooks fixed to the ships, I      
resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors,          
receiving above two hundred shots in my face and hands; then I took up      
the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks were tied, and with         
great ease drew fifty of the enemy's men-of-war after me.                   
  The Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I            
intended, were at first confounded with astonishment. They had seen me      
cut the cables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run         
adrift or fall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole        
fleet moving in order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such      
a scream of grief and despair, that it is almost impossible to              
describe or conceive. When I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile        
to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face, and rubbed          
on some of the same ointment that was given me at my first arrival, as      
I have formerly mentioned. I then took off my spectacles, and               
waiting about an hour, till the tide was a little fallen, I waded           
through the middle with my cargo, and arrived safe at the royal port        
of Lilliput                                                                 
  The Emperor and his whole court stood on the shore expecting the          
issue of this great adventure. They saw the ships move forward in a         
large half-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast          
in water. When I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were           
yet in more pain, because I was under water to my neck. The Emperor         
concluded me to be drowned, and that the enemy's fleet was approaching      
in a hostile manner: but he was soon eased of his fears, for the            
channel growing shallower every step I made, I came in a short time         
within hearing, and holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet      
was fastened, I cried in a loud voice, Long live the most puissant          
Emperor of Lilliput! This great prince received me at my landing            
with all possible encomiums, and created me a Nardac upon the spot,         
which is the highest title of honor among them.                             
  His Majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of                
bringing all the rest of his enemy's ships into his ports. And so           
unmeasurable is the ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of         
nothing less than reducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a              
province, and governing it by a Viceroy; of destroying the                  
Big-Endian exiles, and compelling that people to break the smaller end      
of their eggs, by which he would remain the sole monarch of the             
whole world. But I endeavored to divert him from this design, by            
many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as well as justice; and      
I plainly protested, that I would never be an instrument of bringing a      
free and brave people into slavery. And when the matter was debated in      
council, the wisest part of the ministry were of my opinion.                
  This open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes         
and politics of his Imperial Majesty, that he could never forgive           
it; he mentioned it in a very artful manner at council, where I was         
told that some of the wisest appeared, at least by their silence, to        
be of my opinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not         
forbear some expressions, which by a side-wind reflected on me. And         
from this time began an intrigue between his Majesty and a junto of         
ministers maliciously bent against me, which broke out in less than         
two months, and had like to have ended in my utter destruction. Of          
so little weight are the greatest services to princes, when put into        
the balance with a refusal to gratify their passions.                       
                                                     {P_1|CH_5 ^paragraph 5}
  About three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy      
from Blefuscu, with humble offers of a peace; which was soon concluded      
upon conditions very advantageous to our Emperor, wherewith I shall         
not trouble the reader. There were six ambassadors, with a train of         
about five hundred persons, and their entry was very magnificent,           
suitable to the grandeur of their master, and the importance of             
their business. When their treaty was finished, wherein I did them          
several good offices by the credit I now had, or at least appeared          
to have at court, their Excellencies, who were privately told how much      
I had been their friend, made me a visit in form. They began with many      
compliments upon my valor and generosity, invited me to that kingdom        
in the Emperor their master's name, and desired me to show them some        
proofs of my prodigious strength, of which they had heard so many           
wonders; wherein I readily obliged them, but shall not trouble the          
reader with the particulars.                                                
  When I had for some time entertained their Excellencies, to their         
infinite satisfaction and surprise, I desired they would do me the          
honor to present my most humble respects to the Emperor their               
master, the renown of whose had so justly filled the whole world            
with admiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend before         
I returned to my own country: accordingly, the next time I had the          
honor to see our Emperor, I desired his general license to wait on the      
Blefuscudian monarch, which he was pleased to grant me, as I could          
plainly perceive, in a very cold manner; but could not guess the            
reason, till I had a whisper from a certain person, that Flimnap and        
Bolgolam had represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a         
mark of disaffection, from which I am sure my heart was wholly free.        
And this was the first time I began to conceive some imperfect idea of      
courts and ministers.                                                       
  It is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me by an            
interpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each      
other as any two in Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the         
antiquity, beauty, and energy of their own tongues, with an avowed          
contempt for that of their neighbor; yet our Emperor, standing upon         
the advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet, obliged them        
to deliver their credentials, and make their speech in the Lilliputian      
tongue. And it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of        
trade and commerce between both realms, from the continual reception        
of exiles, which is mutual among them, and from the custom in each          
empire to send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other, in      
order to polish themselves by seeing the world and understanding men        
and manners; there are few persons of distinction, or merchants, or         
seamen, who dwell in the maritime parts, but what can hold                  
conversation both tongues; as I found some weeks after, when I went to      
pay my respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu, which in the midst of           
great misfortunes, through the malice of my enemies, proved a very          
happy adventure to me, as I shall relate in its proper place.               
  The reader may remember, that when I signed those articles upon           
which I recovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked upon         
account of their being too servile, neither could anything but an           
extreme necessity have forced me to submit. But being now a Nardac, of      
the highest rank in that empire, such offices were looked upon as           
below my dignity, and the Emperor (to do him justice) never once            
mentioned them to me. However, it was not long before I had an              
opportunity of doing his Majesty, at least, as I then thought, a            
most signal service. I was alarmed at midnight with the cries of            
many hundred people at my door; by which being suddenly awaked, I           
was in some kind of terror. I heard the word burglum repeated               
incessantly: several of the Emperor's court, making their way               
through the crowd, entreated me to come immediately to the Palace,          
where her Imperial Majesty's apartment was on fire, by the                  
carelessness of a maid of honor, who fell asleep while she was reading      
a romance. I got up in an instant; and orders being given to clear the      
way before me, and it being likewise a moonshine night, I made a shift      
to get to the Palace without trampling on any of the people. I found        
they had already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment, and         
were well provided with buckets, but the water was at some distance.        
These buckets were about the size of a large thimble, and the poor          
people supplied me with them as fast as they could; but the flame           
was so violent that they did little good. I might easily have               
stifled it with my coat, which I unfortunately left behind me for           
haste, and came away only in my leathern jerkin. The case seemed            
wholly desperate and deplorable; and this magnificent palace would          
have infallibly been burned down to the ground, if, by a presence of        
mind, unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an expedient. I had      
the evening before drunk plentifully of a most delicious wine,              
called glimigrim (the Blefuscudians call it flunec, but ours is             
esteemed the better sort), which is very diuretic. By the luckiest          
chance in the world, I had not discharged myself of any part of it.         
The heat I had contracted by coming very near the flames, and by            
laboring to quench them, made the wine begin to operate my urine;           
which I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper        
places, that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and         
the rest of that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in                 
erecting, preserved from destruction.                                       
  It was now daylight, and I returned to my house without waiting to        
congratulate with the Emperor: because, although I had done a very          
eminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his Majesty might        
resent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental      
laws of the realm, it is capital in any person, of what quality             
soever, to make water within the precincts of the palace. But I was         
a little comforted by a message from his Majesty, that he would give        
orders to the Grand Justiciary for passing my pardon in form; which,        
however, I could not obtain. And I was privately assured, that the          
Empress, conceiving the greatest abhorrence of what I had done,             
removed to the most distant side of the court, firmly resolved that         
those buildings should never be repaired for her use: and, in the           
presence of her chief confidants could not forbear vowing revenge.          
                                                                            
P_1|CH_6                                                                    
  CHAPTER VI                                                                
-                                                                           
  Although I intend to leave the description of this empire to a            
particular treatise, yet in the meantime I am content to gratify the        
curious reader with some general ideas. As the common size of the           
natives is somewhat under six inches high, so there is an exact             
proportion in all other animals, as well as plants and trees: for           
instance, the tallest horses and oxen are between four and five inches      
in height, the sheep an inch and a half, more or less: their geese          
about the bigness of a sparrow, and so the several gradations               
downwards till you come to the smallest, which, to my sight, were           
almost invisible; but nature had adapted the eyes of the                    
Lilliputians to all objects proper for their view: they see with great      
exactness, but at no great distance. And to show the sharpness of           
their sight towards objects that are near, I have been much pleased         
with observing a cook pulling a lark, which was not so large as a           
common fly; and a young girl threading an invisible needle with             
invisible silk. Their tallest trees are about seven feet high; I            
mean some of those in the great royal park, the tops whereof I could        
but just reach with my fist clenched. The other vegetables are in           
the same proportion; but this I leave to the reader's imagination.          
  I shall say but little at present of their learning, which for            
many ages had flourished in all its branches among them; but their          
manner of writing is very peculiar, being neither from the left to the      
right, like the Europeans; nor from the right to the left, like the         
Arabians; nor from up to down, like the Chinese; nor from down to           
up, like the Cascagians; but aslant from one corner of the paper to         
the other, like ladies in England.                                          
  They bury their dead with their heads directly downwards, because         
they hold an opinion, that in eleven thousand moons they are all to         
rise again, in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat)      
will turn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their               
resurrection, be found ready standing on their feet. The learned among      
them confess the absurdity of this doctrine, but the practice still         
continues, in compliance to the vulgar.                                     
  There are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar; and if      
they were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country,         
I should be tempted to say a little in their justification. It is only      
to be wished that they were as well executed. The first I shall             
mention relates to informers. All crimes against the state are              
punished here with the utmost severity; but if the person accused           
makes his innocence plainly to appear upon his trial, the accuser is        
immediately put to an ignominious death; and out of his goods or            
lands, the innocent person is quadruply recompensed for the loss of         
his time, for the danger he underwent, for the hardship of his              
imprisonment, and for all the charges he had been at in making his          
defense. Or, if that fund be deficient, it is largely supplied by           
the Crown. The Emperor does also confer on him some public mark of his      
favor, and proclamation is made of his innocence through the whole          
city.                                                                       
  They look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore         
seldom fail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and         
vigilance, with a very common understanding, may preserve a man's           
goods from thieves, but honesty has no fence against superior cunning;      
and since it is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse      
of buying and selling, and dealing upon credit, where fraud is              
permitted and connived at, or has no law to punish it, the honest           
dealer is always undone, and the knave gets the advantage. remember         
when I was once interceding with the King for a criminal who had            
wronged his master of a great sum of money, which he had received by        
order, and ran away with; and happening to tell his Majesty, by way of      
extenuation, that it was only a breach of trust; the Emperor thought        
it monstrous in me to offer, as a defense, the greatest aggravation of      
the crime: and truly I had little to say in return, farther than the        
common answer, that different nations had different customs; for, I         
confess, I was heartily ashamed.                                            
                                                     {P_1|CH_6 ^paragraph 5}
  Although we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon        
which all government turns, yet I could never observe this maxim to be      
put in practice by any nation except that of Lilliput. Whoever can          
there bring sufficient proof that he has strictly observed the laws of      
his country for seventy-three moons, has a claim to certain                 
privileges, according to his quality and condition of life, with a          
proportionable sum of money out of a fund appropriated for that use:        
he likewise acquires the title of Snilpall, or Legal, which is added        
to his name, but does not descend to his posterity. And these people        
thought it a prodigious defect of policy among us, when I told them         
that our laws were enforced only by penalties without any mention of        
reward. It is upon this account that the image of justice, in their         
courts of judicature, is formed with six eyes, two before, as many          
behind, and on each side one, to signify circumspection; with a bag of      
gold open in her right hand, and a sword sheathed in her left, to show      
she is more disposed to reward than to punish.                              
  In choosing persons for all employments, they have more regard to         
good morals than to great abilities; for, since government is               
necessary to mankind, they believe-that the common size of human            
understandings is fitted to some station or other, and that Providence      
never intended to make the management of public affairs a mystery,          
to be comprehended only by a few persons of sublime genius, of which        
there seldom are three born in an age: but they suppose truth,              
justice, temperance, and the like, to be in every man's power; the          
practice of which virtues, assisted by experience and a good                
intention, would qualify any man for the service of his country,            
except where a course of study is required. But they thought the            
want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by superior            
endowments of the mind, that employments could never be put into            
such dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified; and at least,        
that the mistakes committed by ignorance in a virtuous disposition,         
would never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal, as the         
practices of a man whose inclinations led him to be corrupt, and had        
great abilities to manage, and multiply, and defend his corruptions.        
  In like manner, the disbelief of a Divine Providence renders a man        
incapable of holding any public station; for, since kings avow              
themselves to be the deputies of Providence, the Lilliputians think         
nothing can be more absurd than for a prince to employ such men as          
disown the authority under which he acts.                                   
  In relating these and the following laws, I would only be understood      
to mean the original institutions, and not the most scandalous              
corruptions into which these people are fallen by the degenerate            
nature of man. For as to that infamous practice of acquiring great          
employments by dancing on the ropes, or badges of favor and                 
distinction by leaping over sticks and creeping under them, the reader      
is to observe, that they were first introduced by the grandfather of        
the Emperor now reigning, and grew to the present height by the             
gradual increase of party and faction.                                      
   Ingratitude is among them a capital crime, as we read it to have         
been in some other countries; for they reason thus, that whoever makes      
ill returns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the          
rest of mankind, from whom he has received no obligation, and               
therefore such a man is not fit to live.                                    
                                                    {P_1|CH_6 ^paragraph 10}
  Their notions relating to the duties of parents and children              
differ extremely from ours. For since the conjunction of male and           
female is founded upon the great law of nature, in order to                 
propagate and continue the species, the Lilliputians will needs have        
it, that men and women are joined together like other animals, by           
the motives of concupiscence; and that their tenderness towards             
their young proceeds from the like natural principle: for which reason      
they will never allow, that a child is under any obligation to his          
father for begetting him, or his mother for bringing him into the           
world; which, considering the miseries of human life, was neither a         
benefit itself, nor intended so by his parents, whose thoughts in           
their love-encounters were otherwise employed. Upon these, and the          
like reasonings, their opinion is, that parents are the last of all         
others to be trusted with the education of their own children: and          
therefore they have in every town public nurseries, where all parents,      
except cottagers and laborers, are obliged to send their infants of         
both sexes to be reared and educated when they come to the age of           
twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to have some rudiments        
of docility. These schools are of several kinds, suited to different        
qualities, and to both sexes. They have certain professors well             
skilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits        
the rank of their parents, and their own capacities as well as              
inclinations. I shall say something of the male nurseries, and then of      
the female.                                                                 
  The nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth are provided            
with grave and learned professors, and their several deputies. The          
clothes and food of the children are plain and simple. They are bred        
up in the principles of honor, justice, courage, modesty, clemency,         
religion, and love of their country; they are always employed in            
some business, except in the times of eating and sleeping, which are        
very short, and two hours for diversions, consisting of bodily              
exercises. They are dressed by men till four years of age, and then         
are obliged to dress themselves, although their quality be ever so          
great; and the women attendants, who are aged proportionably to ours        
at fifty, perform only the most menial offices. They are never              
suffered to converse with servants, but go together in small or             
greater numbers to take their diversions, and always in the presence        
of a professor, or one of his deputies; whereby they avoid those early      
bad impressions of folly and vice to which our children are subject.        
Their parents are suffered to see them only twice a year; the visit is      
to last but an hour. They are allowed to kiss the child at meeting and      
parting; but a professor, who always stands by on those occasions,          
will not suffer them to whisper, or use any fondling expressions, or        
bring any presents of toys, sweetmeats, and the like.                       
  The pension from each family for the education and entertainment          
of a child, upon failure of due payment, is levied by the Emperor's         
officers.                                                                   
  The nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen, merchants,              
traders, and handicrafts, are managed proportionably after the same         
manner; only those designed for trades are put out apprentices at           
eleven years old, whereas those of persons of quality continue in           
their exercises till fifteen, which answers to one and twenty with us:      
but the confinement is gradually lessened for the last three years.         
  In the female nurseries, the young girls of quality are educated          
much like the males, only they are dressed by orderly servants of           
their own sex; but always in the presence of a professor or deputy,         
till they come to dress themselves, which is at five years old. And if      
it be found that these nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with      
frightful or foolish stories, or the common follies practiced by            
chambermaids among us, they are publicly whipped thrice about the           
city, imprisoned for a year and banished for life to the most desolate      
part of the country. Thus the young ladies there are as much ashamed        
of being cowards and fools as the men, and despise all personal             
ornaments beyond decency and cleanliness: neither did I perceive any        
difference in their education, made by their difference of sex, only        
that the exercises of the females were not altogether so robust; and        
that some rules were given them relating to domestic life, and a            
smaller compass of learning was enjoined them: for their maxim is,          
that among people of quality a wife should be always a reasonable           
and agreeable companion, because she cannot always be young. When           
the girls are twelve years old, which among them is the marriageable        
age, their parents or guardians take them home, with great expressions      
of gratitude to the professors, and seldom without tears of the             
young lady and her companions.                                              
                                                    {P_1|CH_6 ^paragraph 15}
  In the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are          
instructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex, and their            
several degrees: those intended for apprentices are dismissed at            
nine years old, the rest are to thirteen.                                   
  The meaner families who have children at these nurseries, are             
obliged, besides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to      
return to the steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their         
gettings, to be a portion for the child; and therefore all parents are      
limited in their expenses by the law. For the Lilliputians think            
nothing can be more unjust, than for people, in subservience to             
their own appetites, to bring children into the world and leave the         
burden of supporting them on the public. As to persons of quality,          
they give security to appropriate a certain sum for each child,             
suitable to their condition; and these funds are always managed with        
good husbandry, and the most exact justice.                                 
  The cottagers and laborers keep their children at home, their             
business being only to till and cultivate the earth, and therefore          
their education is of little consequence to the public; but the old         
and discased among them are supported by hospitals: for begging is a        
trade unknown in this kingdom.                                              
  And here it may perhaps divert the curious reader to give some            
account of my domestics, and my manner of living in this country,           
during a residence of nine months and thirteen days. Having a head          
mechanically turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had          
made for myself a table and chair convenient enough, out of the             
largest trees in the royal park. Two hundred seamstresses were              
employed to make me shirts, and linen for my bed and table, all of the      
strongest and coarsest kind they could get; which, however, they            
were forced to quilt together in several folds, for the thickest was        
some degrees finer than lawn. Their linen is usually three inches           
wide, and three feet make a piece. The seamstresses took my measure as      
I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and another at my             
mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the end, while      
the third measured the length of the cord with a rule an inch long.         
Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a            
mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the      
wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my           
old shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a                
pattern, they fitted me exactly. Three hundred tailors were employed        
in the same manner to make me clothes; but they had another                 
contrivance for taking my measure. I kneeled down, and they raised a        
ladder from the ground to my neck; upon this ladder one of them             
mounted, and let fall a plumb-line from my collar to the floor,             
which just answered the length of my coat; but my waist and arms I          
measured myself. When my clothes finished, which was done in my             
house (for the largest of theirs would not have been able to hold           
them) they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in England,        
only that mine were all of a color.                                         
  I had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient      
huts built about my house, where they and their families lived, and         
prepared me two dishes apiece. I took up twenty waiters in my hand,         
and placed them on the table; a hundred more attended below on the          
ground, some with dishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine, and        
other liquors, slung on their shoulders; all which the waiters above        
drew up as I wanted, in a very ingenious manner, by certain cords,          
as we draw the bucket up a well in Europe. A dish of their meat was         
a good mouthful, and a barrel of their liquor a reasonable draught.         
Their mutton yields to ours, but their beef is excellent. I have had a      
sirloin so large, that I have been forced to make three bits of it;         
but this is rare. My servants were astonished to see me eat it bones        
and all, as in our country we do the leg of a lark. Their geese and         
turkeys I usually ate at a mouthful, and I must confess they far            
exceed ours. Of their smaller fowl I could take up twenty or thirty at      
the end of my knife.                                                        
                                                    {P_1|CH_6 ^paragraph 20}
  One day his Imperial Majesty, being informed of my way of living,         
desired that himself and his Royal Consort, with the young Princes          
of the blood of both sexes, might have the happiness (as he was             
pleased to call it) of dining with me. They came accordingly, and I         
placed them upon chairs of state on my table, just over against me,         
with their guards about them. Flimnap, the Lord High Treasurer,             
attended there likewise with his white staff; and I observed he             
often looked on me with a sour countenance, which I would not seem          
to regard, but ate more than usual, in honor to my dear country, as         
well as to fill the court with admiration. I have some private reasons      
to believe, that this visit from his Majesty gave Flimnap an                
opportunity of doing me ill offices to his master. That minister had        
always been my secret enemy, though he outwardly caressed me more than      
was usual to the moroseness of his nature. He represented to the            
Emperor the low condition of his treasury; that he was forced to            
take up money at great discount; that exchequer bills would not             
circulate under nine per cent below par; that in short I had cost           
his Majesty above a million and a half of sprugs (their greatest            
gold coin, about the bigness of a spangle) and upon the whole, that it      
would be advisable in the Emperor to take the first fair occasion of        
dismissing me.                                                              
  I am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent             
lady, who was an innocent sufferer upon my account. The Treasurer took      
a fancy to be jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil             
tongues, who informed him that her Grace had taken a violent affection      
for my person; and the court-scandal ran for some time, that she            
once came privately to my lodging. This I solemnly declare to be a          
most infamous falsehood, without any grounds, farther than that her         
Grace was pleased to treat me with all innocent marks of freedom and        
friendship. I own she came often to my house, but always publicly, nor      
ever without three more in the coach, who were usually her sister           
and young daughter, and some particular acquaintance; but this was          
common to many other ladies of the court. And I still appeal to my          
servants round, whether they at any time saw a coach at my door             
without knowing what persons were in it. On those occasions, when a         
servant had given me notice, my custom was to go immediately to the         
door; and, after paying my respects, to take up the coach and two           
horses very carefully in my hands (for if there were six horses, the        
postillion always unharnessed four) and place them on a table, where I      
had fixed a moveable rim quite round, of five inches high, to               
prevent accidents. And I have often had four coaches and horses at          
once on my table full of company, while I sat in my chair leaning my        
face towards them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen        
would gently drive the others round my table. I have passed many an         
afternoon very agreeably in these conversations. But I defy the             
Treasurer, or his two informers (I will name them, and let them make        
their best of it) Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person ever        
came to me incognito, except the secretary Reldresal, who was sent          
by express command of his Imperial Majesty, as I have before                
related. I should not have dwelt so long upon this particular, it           
had not been a point wherein the reputation of a great lady is so           
nearly concerned, to say nothing of my own; though I then had the           
honor to be a Nardac, which the Treasurer himself is not; for all           
the world knows he is only a Glumglum, a title inferior by one degree,      
as that of a Marquis is to a Duke in England, although I allow he           
preceded me in right of his post. These false informations, which I         
afterwards came to the knowledge of, by an accident not proper to           
mention, made Flimnap the Treasurer show his lady for some time an ill      
countenance, and me a worse; and although he were at last undeceived        
and reconciled to her, yet I lost all credit with him, and found my         
interest decline very fast with the Emperor himself, who was indeed         
too much governed by that favorite.                                         
                                                                            
P_1|CH_7                                                                    
  CHAPTER VII                                                               
-                                                                           
  Before I proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it        
may be proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had          
been for two months forming against me.                                     
  I had been hitherto all my life a stranger to courts, for which I         
was unqualified by the meanness of my condition. I had indeed heard         
and read enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers;         
but never expected to have found such terrible effects of them in so        
remote a country, governed, as I thought, by very different maxims          
from those in Europe.                                                       
  When I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the Emperor of          
Blefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very           
serviceable at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his      
Imperial Majesty) came to my house very privately at night in a             
close chair, and without sending his name, desired admittance. The          
chairmen were dismissed; I put the chair, with his Lordship in it,          
into my coat-pocket: and giving orders to a trusty servant to say I         
was indisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house,          
placed the chair on the table, according to my usual custom, and sat        
down by it. After the common salutations were over, observing his           
Lordship's countenance full of concern, and enquiring into the reason,      
he desired I would hear him with patience in a matter that highly           
concerned my honor and my life. His speech was to the following             
effect, for I took notes of it as soon as he left me.                       
  You are to know, said he, that several Committees of Council have         
been lately called in the most private manner on your account; and          
it is but two days since his Majesty came to a full resolution.             
  You are very sensible that Skyresh Bolgolam (Galbet, or High              
Admiral) has been your mortal enemy almost ever since your arrival.         
His original reasons I know not, but his hatred is much increased           
since your great success against Blefuscu, by which his glory as            
Admiral is obscured. This Lord, in conjunction with Flimnap the High        
Treasurer, whose enmity against you is notorious on account of his          
lady, Limtoc the General, Lalcon the Chamberlain, and Balmuff the           
Grand Justiciary, have prepared articles of impeachment against you,        
for treason, and other capital crimes.                                      
                                                     {P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 5}
  This preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own              
merits and innocence, that I was going to interrupt; when he entreated      
me to be silent, and thus proceeded.                                        
  Out of gratitude for the favors you have done me, I procured              
information of the whole proceedings, and a copy of the articles,           
wherein I venture my head for your service.

Flestrin, in open breach of the said law, under color of extinguishing      
the fire kindled in the apartment of his Majesty's most dear

of Blefuscu into the royal port, and being afterwards commanded by his      
Imperial Majesty to seize all the other ships of the said empire of         
Blefuscu, and reduce that empire to a province, to be governed by a         
Viceroy from hence, and to destroy and put to death not only all the

would not immediately forsake the Big-Endian heresy: He, the said           
Flestrin, like a false traitor against his most Auspicious, Serene,         
Imperial Majesty, did petition to be excused from the said service          
upon pretense of unwillingness to force the consciences, or destroy         
the liberties and lives of an innocent people.                              
-                                                                           
                            ARTICLE III.                                    
  That, whereas certain ambassadors from the court of Blefuscu, to sue      
for peace in his Majesty's court: He, the said Flestrin, did, like a        
false traitor, aid, abet, comfort, and divert the said ambassadors,         
although he knew them to be servants to a Prince who was lately an          
open enemy to his Imperial Majesty, and in open war against his said        
Majesty.                                                                    
-                                                                           
                                                    {P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 20}
                            ARTICLE IV.                                     
  That the said Quinbus Flestrin, contrary to the duty of a faithful        
subject, is now preparing to make a voyage to the court and empire          
of Blefuscu, for which he had received only verbal license from his         
Imperial Majesty; and under color of the said license, doth falsely         
and traitorously intend to take the said voyage, and hereby to aid,         
comfort, and abet the Emperor of Blefuscu, so late an enemy, and in         
open war with his Imperial Majesty aforesaid.                               
-                                                                           
  There are some other articles, but these are the most important,          
of which I have read you an abstract.                                       
  In the several debates upon this impeachment, it must be confessed        
that his Majesty gave many marks of his great lenity, often urging the      
services you had done him, and endeavoring to extenuate your crimes.        
The Treasurer and Admiral insisted that you should be put to the            
most painful and ignominious death, by setting fire on your house at        
night, and the General was to attend with twenty thousand men armed         
with poisoned arrows to shoot you on the face and hands. Some of            
your servants were to have private orders to strew a poisonous juice        
on your shirts, which would soon make you tear your own flesh, and die      
in the utmost torture. The General came into the same opinion, so that      
for a long time there was a majority against you. But his Majesty           
resolving, if possible, to spare your life, at last brought off the         
Chamberlain.                                                                
                                                    {P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 25}
  Upon this incident, Reldresal, principal Secretary for Private            
Affairs, who always approved himself your true friend, was commanded        
by the Emperor to deliver his opinion, which he accordingly did; and        
therein justified the good thoughts you have of him. He allowed your        
crimes to be great, but that still there was room for mercy, the            
most commendable virtue in a prince, and for which his Majesty was          
so justly celebrated. He said, the friendship between you and him           
was so well known to the world, that perhaps the most honorable             
board might think him partial: however, in obedience to the command he      
had received, he would freely offer his sentiments. That if his             
Majesty, in consideration of your services, and pursuant to his own         
merciful disposition, would please to spare your life, and only give        
order to put out both your eyes, he humbly conceived that by this           
expedient justice might in some measure be satisfied, and all the           
world would applaud the lenity of the Emperor, as well as the fair and      
generous proceedings of those who have the honor to be his                  
counsellors. That the loss of your eyes would be no impediment to your      
bodily strength, by which you might still be useful to his Majesty.         
That blindness is an addition to courage, by concealing dangers from        
us; that the fear you had for your eyes was the greatest difficulty in      
bringing over the enemy's fleet, and it would be sufficient for you to      
see by the eyes of the ministers, since the greatest princes do no          
more.                                                                       
  This proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the          
whole board. Bolgolam, the Admiral, could not preserve his temper, but      
rising up in fury said he wondered how the Secretary dared presume          
to give his opinion for preserving the life of a traitor: that the          
services you had performed, were, by all true reasons of state, the         
great aggravation of your crimes; that you, who were able to                
extinguish the fire, by discharge of urine in her Majesty's                 
apartment (which he mentioned with horror), might at another time,          
raise an inundation by the same means, to drown the whole palace;           
and the same strength which enabled you to bring over the enemy's           
fleet, might serve, upon the first discontent, to carry it back:            
that he had good reasons to think you were a Big-Endian in your heart;      
and as treason begins in the heart, before it appears in overt acts,        
so he accused you as a traitor on that account, and therefore insisted      
you should be put to death.                                                 
  The Treasurer was of the same opinion; he showed to what straits his      
Majesty's revenue was reduced by the charge of maintaining you,             
which would soon grow insupportable: that the Secretary's expedient of      
putting out your eyes was so far from being a remedy against this           
evil, it would probably increase it, as it is manifest from the common      
practice of blinding some kind of fowl, after which they fed the            
faster, and grew sooner fat: that his sacred Majesty and the                
Council, who are your judges, were in their own consciences fully           
convinced of your guilt, which was a sufficient argument to condemn         
you to death, without the formal proofs required by the strict              
letter of the law.                                                          
  But his Imperial Majesty, fully determined against capital                
punishment, was graciously pleased to say, that since the Council           
thought the loss of your eyes too easy a censure, some other may be         
inflicted hereafter. And your friend the Secretary humbly desiring          
to be heard again, in answer to what the Treasurer had objected             
concerning the great charge his Majesty was at in maintaining you,          
said that his Excellency, who had the sole disposal of the Emperor's        
revenue, might easily provide against that evil, by gradually               
lessening your establishment; by which, for want of sufficient food,        
you would grow weak and faint, and lose your appetite, and                  
consequently decay and consume in a few months; neither would the           
stench of your carcass be then so dangerous, when it should become          
more than half diminished; and immediately upon your death, five or         
six thousand of his Majesty's subjects might, in two or three days,         
cut your flesh from your bones, take it away by cartloads, and bury it      
in distant parts to prevent infection, leaving the skeleton as a            
monument of admiration to posterity.                                        
  Thus by the great friendship of the Secretary, the whole affair           
was compromised. It was strictly enjoined, that the project of              
starving you by degrees should be kept a secret, but the sentence of        
putting out your eyes was entered on the books; none dissenting except      
Bolgolam the Admiral, who, being a creature of the Empress, was             
perpetually instigated by her Majesty to insist upon your death, she        
having borne perpetual malice against you, on account of that infamous      
and illegal method you took to extinguish the fire in her apartment.        
                                                    {P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 30}
  In three days your friend the Secretary will be directed to come          
to your house, and read before you the articles of impeachment; and         
then to signify the great lenity and favor of his Majesty and Council,      
whereby you are only condemned to the loss of your eyes, which his          
Majesty does not question you will gratefully and humbly submit to;         
and twenty of his Majesty's surgeons will attend, in order to see           
the operation well performed, by discharging very sharp-pointed arrows      
into the balls of your eyes, as you lie on the ground.                      
  I leave to your prudence what measures you will take; and to avoid        
suspicion, I must immediately return in as private a manner as I came.      
  His Lordship did so, and I remained alone, under many doubts and          
perplexities of mind.                                                       
  It was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry (very          
different, as I have been assured, from the practices of former times)      
that after the court had decreed any cruel execution, either to             
gratify the monarch's resentment, or the malice of a favorite, the          
Emperor always made a speech to his whole Council, expressing his           
great lenity and tenderness, as qualities known and confessed by all        
the world. This speech was immediately published through the                
kingdom; nor did anything terrify the people so much as those               
encomiums on his Majesty's mercy; because it was observed, that the         
more these praises were enlarged and insisted on, the more inhuman was      
the punishment, and the sufferer more innocent. And as to myself, I         
must confess, having never been designed for a courtier either by my        
birth or education, I was so ill a judge of things, that I could not        
discover the lenity and favor of this sentence, but conceived it            
(perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous than gentle. I sometimes        
thought of standing my trial, for although I could not deny the             
facts alleged in the several articles, yet I hoped they would admit of      
some extenuations. But having in my life perused many state trials,         
which I ever observed to terminate as the judges thought fit to             
direct, I dared not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so critical         
a juncture, and against such powerful enemies. Once I was strongly          
bent upon resistance, for while I had liberty, the whole strength of        
that empire could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with stones          
pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that project with        
horror, by remembering the oath I had made to the Emperor, the              
favors I received from him, and the high title of Nardac he                 
conferred upon me. Neither had I so soon learned the gratitude of           
courtiers, to persuade myself that his Majesty's present severities         
quitted me of all past obligations.                                         
  At last I fixed upon a resolution, for which it is probable I may         
incur some censure, and not unjustly; for I confess I owe the               
preserving of my eyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great         
rashness and want of experience: because if I had then known the            
nature of princes and ministers, which I have since observed in many        
other courts, and their methods of treating criminals less obnoxious        
than myself, I should with great alacrity and readiness have submitted      
to so easy a punishment. But hurried on by the precipitancy of              
youth, and having his Imperial Majesty's license to pay my                  
attendance upon the Emperor of Blefuscu, I took this opportunity,           
before the three days were elapsed, to send a letter to my friend           
the Secretary, signifying my resolution of setting out that morning         
Blefuscu pursuant to the leave I had got; and without waiting for an        
answer, I went to that side of the island where our fleet lay. I            
seized a large man of war, tied a cable to the prow, and, lifting up        
the anchors, I stripped myself, put my clothes (together with my            
coverlet, which I brought under my arm) into the vessel, and drawing        
it after me between wading and swimming, arrived at the royal port          
of Blefuscu, where the people had long expected me; they lent me two        
guides to direct me to the capital city, which is of the same name.         
I held them in my hands till I came within two hundred yards of the         
gate, and desired them to signify my arrival to one of the                  
secretaries, and let him know, I there waited his Majesty's                 
commands. I had an answer in about an hour, that his Majesty, attended      
by the Royal Family, and great officers of the court, was coming out        
to receive me. I advanced a hundred yards. The Emperor and his train        
alighted from their horses, the Empress and ladies from their coaches,      
and I did not perceive they were in any fright or concern. I lay on         
the ground to kiss his Majesty's and the Empress's hand. I told his         
Majesty that I had come according to my promise, and with the               
license of the Emperor, my master, to have the honor of seeing so           
mighty a monarch, and to offer him any service in my power, consistent      
with my duty to my own prince; not mentioning a word of my disgrace,        
because I had hitherto no regular information of it, and might suppose      
myself wholly ignorant of any such design; neither could I                  
reasonably conceive that the Emperor would discover the secret while I      
was out of his power: wherein, however, it soon appeared I was              
deceived.                                                                   
                                                    {P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 35}
  I shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my          
reception at this court, which was suitable to the generosity of so         
great a prince; nor of the difficulties I was in for want of a house        
and bed, being forced to lie on the ground, wrapped up in my coverlet.      
                                                                            
P_1|CH_8                                                                    
  CHAPTER VIII                                                              
-                                                                           
  Three days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the              
northeast coast of the island, I observed, about half a league off, in      
the sea, something that looked like a boat overturned. I pulled off my      
shoes and stockings, and wading two or three hundred yards, I found         
the object to approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly        
saw it to be a real boat, which I supposed might, by some tempest,          
have been driven from a ship; whereupon I returned immediately towards      
the city, and desired his Imperial Majesty to lend me twenty of the         
tallest vessels he had left after the loss of his fleet, and three          
thousand seamen under the command of his Vice-Admiral. This fleet           
sailed round, while I went back the shortest way to the coast where         
I first discovered the boat; I found the tide had driven it still           
nearer. The seamen were all provided with cordage, which I had              
beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength. When the ships came up, I      
stripped myself, and waded till I came within a hundred yards of the        
boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got up to it. The seamen      
threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a hole in the             
forepart of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but I found        
all my labor to little purpose; for being out of my depth, I was not        
able to work. In this necessity, I was forced to swim behind, and push      
the boat forwards as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the        
tide favoring me, I advanced so far, that I could just hold up my chin      
and feel the ground. I rested two or three minutes, and then gave           
the boat another shove, and so on till the sea was no higher than my        
arm-pits; and now the most laborious part being over, I took out my         
other cables, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fastening          
them first to the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended      
me; the wind being favorable, the seamen towed, and I shoved till we        
arrived within forty yards of the shore; and waiting till the tide was      
out, I got dry to the boat, and by the assistance of two thousand men,      
with ropes and engines, I made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and        
found it was but little damaged.                                            
  I shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under          
by the help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to           
get my boat to the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of      
people appeared upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so          
prodigious a vessel. I told the Emperor that my good fortune had            
thrown this boat in my way, to carry me to some place from whence I         
might return into my native country, and begged his Majesty's orders        
for getting materials to fit it up, together with his license to            
depart; which, after some kind expostulations, he was pleased to            
grant.                                                                      
  I did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any        
express relating to me from our Emperor to the court of Blefuscu.           
But I was afterwards given privately to understand, that his                
Imperial Majesty, never imagining I had the least notice of his             
designs, believed I was only gone to Blefuscu in performance of my          
promise, according to the license he had given me, which was well           
known at our court, and would return in a few days when that                
ceremony was ended. But he was at last in pain at my long absence; and      
after consulting with the Treasurer, and the rest of that cabal, a          
person of quality was dispatched with the copy of the articles against      
me. This envoy had instructions to represent to the monarch of              
Blefuscu the great lenity of his master, who was content to punish          
me no farther than with the loss of my eyes; that I had fled from           
justice, and if I did not return in two hours, I should be deprived of      
my title of Nardac, and declared a traitor. The envoy further added,        
that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both empires,         
his master expected, that his brother of Blefuscu would give orders to      
have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be punished          
as a traitor.                                                               
  The Emperor of Blefuscu having taken three days to consult, returned      
an answer consisting of many civilities and excuses. He said, that          
as for sending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that           
although I had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great                 
obligations to me for many good offices I had done him in making the        
peace. That however both their Majesties would soon be made easy;           
for I had found a prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me          
on the sea, which he had given order to fit up with my own                  
assistance and direction; and he hoped in a few weeks both empires          
would be freed from so insupportable an incumbrance.                        
  With this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput, and the monarch          
of Blefuscu related to me all that had past, offering me at the same        
time (but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection,          
if I would continue in his service; wherein although I believed him         
sincere, yet I resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or      
ministers, where I could possibly avoid it; and therefore, with all         
due acknowledgements for his favorable intentions, I humbly begged          
to be excused. I told him that since fortune, whether good or evil,         
had thrown a vessel in my way, I was resolved to venture myself in the      
ocean, rather than be an occasion of difference between two such            
mighty monarchs. Neither did I find the Emperor at all displeased; and      
I discovered by a certain accident, that he was very glad of my             
resolution, and so were most of his ministers.                              
                                                     {P_1|CH_8 ^paragraph 5}
  These considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner      
than I intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very        
readily contributed. Five hundred workmen were employed to make two         
sails to my boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen          
fold of their strongest linen together. I was at the pains of making        
ropes and cables, by twisting ten, twenty or thirty of the thickest         
and strongest of theirs. A great stone that I happened to find,             
after a long search, by the sea-shore, served me for an anchor. I           
had the tallow of three hundred cows for greasing my boat, and other        
uses. I was at incredible pains in cutting down some of the largest         
timber-trees for oars and masts, wherein I was, however, much assisted      
by his Majesty's ship carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them,          
after I had done the rough work.                                            
  In about a month, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his            
Majesty's commands, and to take my leave. The Emperor and Royal Family      
came out of the palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand,             
which he very graciously gave me: so did the Empress and young Princes      
of the blood. His Majesty presented me with fifty purses of two             
hundred sprugs apiece, together with his picture at full length, which      
I put immediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt.        
The ceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader          
with at this time.                                                          
  I stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen, and three          
hundred sheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat        
ready dressed as four hundred cooks could provide. I took with me           
six cows and two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to      
carry them into my own country, and propagate the breed. And to feed        
them on board, I had a good bundle of hay, and a bag of corn. I             
would gladly have taken a dozen of the natives, but this was a thing        
the Emperor would by no means permit; and besides a diligent search         
into my pockets, his Majesty engaged my honor not to carry away any of      
his subjects, although with their own consent and desire.                   
  Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail on      
the twenty-fourth day of September, 1701, at six in the morning; and        
when I had gone about four leagues to the northward, the wind being at      
southeast, at six in the evening I descried a small island about            
half a league to the northwest. I advanced forward, and cast anchor on      
the leeside of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited. I then took      
some refreshment, and went to my rest. I slept well, and I                  
conjecture at least six hours, for I found the day broke in two             
hours after I awaked. It was a clear night. I ate my breakfast              
before the sun was up; and heaving anchor, the wind being favorable, I      
steered the same course that I had done the day before, wherein I           
was directed by my pocket compass. My intention was to reach, if            
possible, one of those islands, which I had reason to believe lay to        
the northeast of Van Diemen's Land. I discovered nothing all that day;      
but upon the next, about three in the afternoon, when I had by my           
computation made twenty-four leagues from Blefuscu, I descried a            
sail steering to the southeast; my course was due east. I hailed            
her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the        
wind slackened. I made all the sail I could, and in half an hour she        
spied me, then hung out her ancient, and discharged a gun. It is not        
easy to express the joy I was in upon the unexpected hope of once more      
seeing my beloved country, and the dear pledges I had left in it.           
The ship slackened her sails, and I came up with her between five           
and six in the evening, September 26; but my heart leaped within me to      
see her English colors. I put my cows and sheep into my coat                
pockets, and got on board with all my little cargo of provisions.           
The vessel was an English merchantman, returning from Japan by the          
North and South Seas; the Captain, Mr. John Biddle of Deptford, a very      
civil man, and an excellent sailor. We were now in the latitude of          
30 degrees south; there were about fifty men in the ship; and here I        
met an old comrade of mine, one Peter Williams, who gave me a good          
character to the Captain. This gentleman treated me with kindness, and      
desired I would let know what place I came from last, and whither I         
was bound; which I did in few words, but he thought I was raving,           
and that the dangers I underwent had disturbed my head; whereupon I         
took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket, which, after great         
astonishment, clearly convinced him of my veracity. I then showed           
him the gold given me by the Emperor of Blefuscu, together with his         
Majesty's picture at full length, and some other rarities of that           
country. I gave him two purses of two hundred sprugs each, and              
promised, when we arrived in England, to make him a present of a cow        
and a sheep big with young.                                                 
  I shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this          
voyage, which was very prosperous for the most part. We arrived in the      
Downs on the 13th of April, 1702. I had only one misfortune, that           
the rats on board carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a      
hole, picked clean from the flesh. The rest of my cattle I got safe on      
shore, and set them grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the      
fineness of the grass made them feed very heartily, though I had            
always feared the contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved         
them in so long a voyage, if the Captain had not allowed me some of         
his best biscuit, which, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was      
their constant food. The short time I continued in England, I made          
considerable profit by showing my cattle to many persons of quality,        
and others: and before I began my second voyage, I sold them for six        
hundred pounds. Since my last return, I find the breed is considerably      
increased, especially the sheep; which I hope will prove much to the        
advantage of the woollen manufacture, by the fineness of the fleeces.       
                                                    {P_1|CH_8 ^paragraph 10}
  I stayed but two months with my wife and family; for my insatiable        
desire of seeing foreign countries would suffer me to continue no           
longer. I left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife, and fixed her in a      
good house at Redriff. My remaining stock I carried with me, part in        
money, and part in goods, in hopes to improve my fortunes. My eldest        
uncle John had left me an estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty      
pounds a year; and I had a long lease of the Black Bull in Fetter           
Lane, which yielded me as much more; so that I was not in any danger        
of leaving my family upon the parish. My son Johnny, named so after         
his uncle, was at the Grammar School, and a towardly child. My              
daughter Betty (who is now well married, and has children) was then at      
her needlework. I took leave of my wife, and boy and girl, with             
tears on both sides, and went on board the Adventure, a merchantship        
of three hundred tons, bound for Surat, Captain John Nicholas of            
Liverpool, Commander. But my account of this voyage must be referred        
to the second part of my Travels.

  CHAPTER I                                                                 
-                                                                           
  Having been condemned by nature and fortune to an active and              
restless life, in two months after my return I again left my native         
country, and took shipping in the Downs on the 20th day of June, 1702,      
in the Adventure, Captain John Nicholas, a Cornishman, Commander,           
bound for Surat. We had a very prosperous gale till we arrived at           
the Cape of Good Hope, where we landed for fresh water, but                 
discovering a leak we unshipped our goods and wintered there; for           
the Captain falling sick of an ague, we could not leave the Cape            
till the end of March. We then set sail, and had a good voyage till we      
passed the Straits of Madagascar; but having got northward of that          
island, and to about five degrees south latitude, the winds, which          
in those seas are observed to blow a constant equal gale between the        
north and west from the beginning of December to the beginning of May,      
on the 19th of April began to blow with much greater violence, and          
more westerly than usual, continuing so for twenty days together,           
during which time we were driven a little to the east of the Molucca        
Islands, and about three degrees northward of the Line, as our Captain      
found by an observation he took the 2nd of May, at which time the wind      
ceased, and it was a perfect calm, whereat I was not a little               
rejoiced. But he, being a man well experienced in the navigation of         
those seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which accordingly           
happened the day following: for a southern wind, called the southern        
monsoon, began to set in.                                                   
  Finding it was likely to overblow, we took in our spritsail, and          
stood by to hand the foresail; but making foul weather, we looked           
the guns were all fast, and handed the mizzen. The ship lay very broad      
off, so we thought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or        
hulling. We reefed the foresail and set him, we hauled aft the              
foresheet; the helm was hard aweather. The ship wore bravely. We            
belayed the fore-down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down      
the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things        
clear of it. It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and          
dangerous. We hauled off upon the lanyard of the whipstaff, and helped      
the man at helm. We would not get down our topmast, but let all stand,      
because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew that the          
topmast being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer, and made better           
way through the sea, seeing we had sea room. When the storm was             
over, we set foresail and mainsail, and brought the ship to: then we        
set the mizzen, main-topsail, and the fore-topsail. Our course was          
east northeast, the wind was at southwest. We got the starboard             
tacks aboard; we cast off our weather-braces and lifts; we set in           
the leebraces, and hauled forward by the weatherbowlings, and hauled        
them tight, and belayed them, and hauled over the mizzen tack to            
windward, and kept her full and by as near as she would lie.                
  During this storm, which was followed by a strong wind west               
southwest, we were carried by my computation about five hundred             
leagues to the east, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell      
in what part of the world we were. Our provisions held out well, our        
ship was staunch, and our crew all in good health; but we lay in the        
utmost distress for water. We thought it best to hold on the same           
course, rather than turn more northerly, which might have brought us        
to the northwest parts of Great Tartary, and into the frozen sea.           
  On the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the topmost discovered land.      
On the 17th we came in full view of a great island or continent (for        
we knew not which) on the south side whereof was a small neck of            
land jutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a            
ship of above one hundred tons. We cast anchor within a league of this      
creek, and our Captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the            
longboat, with vessels for water if any could be found. I desired           
his leave to go with them, that I might see the country, and make what      
discoveries I could. When we came to land we saw no river or spring,        
nor any sign of inhabitants. Our men therefore wandered on the shore        
to find out some fresh water near the sea, and I walked alone about         
a mile on the other side, where I observed the country all barren           
and rocky. I now began to be weary, and seeing nothing to entertain my      
curiosity, I returned gently down towards the creek; and the sea being      
full in my view, I saw our men already got into the boat, and rowing        
for life to the ship. I was going to halloo after them, although it         
had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge creature walking         
after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not much deeper        
than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had the start      
of him half a league, and the sea thereabouts being full of                 
sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat.         
This I was afterwards told, for I dared not stay to see the issue of        
that adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and        
then climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the            
country. I found it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised        
me was the length of the grass, which in those grounds that seemed          
to be kept for hay, was about twenty feet high.                             
  I fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to      
the inhabitants only as a footpath through a field of barley. Here I        
walked on for some time, but could see little on either side, it being      
now near harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet. I was an         
hour walking to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a           
hedge of at least one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so        
lofty that I could make no computation of their altitude. There was         
a stile to pass from this field into the next. It had four steps,           
and a stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost. It was            
impossible for me to climb this stile, because every step was six feet      
high, and the upper stone above twenty. I was endeavoring to find some      
gap in the hedge, when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next      
field, advancing towards the stile, of the same size with him whom I        
saw in the sea pursuing our boat. He appeared as tall as an ordinary        
spire steeple, and took about ten yards at every stride, as near as         
I could guess. I was struck with the utmost fear and astonishment, and      
ran to hide myself in the corn, from whence I saw him at the top of         
the stile, looking back into the next field on the right hand, and          
heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than a speaking trumpet:      
but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I certainly             
thought it was thunder. Whereupon seven monsters like himself came          
towards him with reaping hooks in their hands, each hook about the          
size of six scythes. These people were not so well clad as the              
first, whose servants or laborers they seemed to be. For upon some          
words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay. I      
kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to         
move with extreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were               
sometimes not above a foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze          
my body between them. However, I made a shift to go forward till I          
came to a part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain        
and wind. Here it was impossible for me to advance a step; for the          
stalks were so interwoven that I could not creep through, and the           
beards of the fallen ears so strong and pointed that they pierced           
through my clothes into my flesh. At the same time I heard the reapers      
not above a hundred yards behind me. Being quite dispirited with toil,      
and wholly overcome by grief and despair, I lay down between two            
ridges, and heartily wished I might there end my days. I bemoaned my        
desolate widow, and fatherless children. I lamented my own folly and        
willfulness in attempting a second voyage against the advice of all my      
friends and relations. In this terrible agitation of mind I could           
not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose inhabitants looked upon me          
as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in the world; where I was        
able to draw an Imperial Fleet in my hand, and perform those other          
actions which will be recorded forever in the chronicles of that            
empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them, although attested        
by millions. I reflected what a mortification it must prove to me to        
appear as inconsiderable in this nation as one single Lilliputian           
would be among us. But this I conceived was to be the least of my           
misfortunes: for as human creatures are observed to be more savage and      
cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to be a          
morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians            
that should happen to seize me? Undoubtedly philosophers are in the         
right when they tell us, that nothing is great or little otherwise          
than by comparison. It might have pleased fortune to let the                
Lilliputians find some nation, where the people were as diminutive          
with respect to them, as they were to me. And who knows but that            
even this prodigious race of mortals might be equally overmatched in        
some distant part of the world, whereof we have yet no discovery?

  Scared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with         
these reflections, when one of the reapers approaching within ten           
yards of the ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next        
step I should be squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two            
with his reaping hook. And therefore when he was again about to             
move, I screamed as loud as fear could make me. Whereupon the huge          
creature trod short, and looking round about under him for some             
time, at last espied me as I lay on the ground. He considered a             
while with the caution of one who endeavors to lay hold on a small          
dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not be able either          
to scratch or to bite him, as I myself have sometimes done with a           
weasel in England. At length he ventured to take me up behind by the        
middle between his forefinger and thumb, and brought me within three        
yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly. I          
guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of        
mind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in         
the air about sixty feet from the ground, although he grievously            
pinched my sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers. All I         
ventured was to raise my eyes towards the sun, and place my hands           
together in a supplicating posture, and to speak some words in a            
humble melancholy tone, suitable to the condition I then was in. For I      
apprehended every moment that he would dash me against the ground,          
as we usually do any little hateful animal which we have a mind to          
destroy. But my good star would have it, that he appeared pleased with      
my voice and gestures, and began to look upon me as a curiosity,            
much wondering to hear me pronounce articulate words, although he           
could not understand them. In the meantime I was not able to forbear        
groaning and shedding tears, and turning my head towards my sides;          
letting him know, as well as I could, how cruelly I was hurt by the         
pressure of his thumb and finger. He seemed to apprehend my meaning;        
for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me gently into it,           
and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was a substantial      
farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field.                  
  The farmer having (as I supposed by their talk) received such an          
account of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small        
straw, about the size of a walking staff, and therewith lifted up           
the lappets of my coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of        
covering that nature had given me. He blew my hair aside to take a          
better view of my face. He called his hinds about him, and asked            
them (as I afterwards learned) whether they had ever seen in the            
fields any little creature that resembled me. He then placed me softly      
on the ground upon all four, but I got immediately up, and walked           
slowly backwards and forwards, to let those people see I had no intent      
to run away. They all sat down in a circle about me, the better to          
observe my motions. I pulled off my hat, and made a low bow towards         
the farmer. I fell on my knees, and lifted up my hands and eyes, and        
spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a purse of gold out          
of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him. He received it on the         
palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye, to see what it          
was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of a pin         
(which he took out of his sleeve), but could make nothing of it.            
Whereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground. I      
took the purse, and opening it, poured all the gold into his palm.          
There were six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty          
or thirty smaller coins. I saw him wet the tip of his little finger         
upon his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then             
another, but he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were. He made        
me a sign to put them again into my purse, and the purse again into my      
pocket, which after offering to him several times, I thought it best        
to do.                                                                      
  The farmer by this time was convinced I must be a rational creature.      
He spoke often to me, but the sound of his voice pierced my ears            
like that of a water mill, yet his words were articulate enough. I          
answered as loud as I could, in several languages, and he often laid        
his car within two yards of me, but all in vain, for we were wholly         
unintelligible to each other. He then sent his servants to their work,      
and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread        
it on his left hand, which he placed flat on the ground, with the palm      
upwards, making me a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for        
it was not above a foot in thickness. I thought it my part to obey,         
and for fear of falling, laid myself at length upon the                     
handkerchief, with the remainder of which he lapped me up to the            
head for further security, and in this manner carried me home to his        
house. There he called his wife, and showed me to her; but she              
screamed and ran back, as women in England do at the sight of a toad        
or a spider. However, when she had a while seen my behavior, and how        
well I observed the signs her husband made, she was soon reconciled,        
and by degrees grew extremely tender of me.                                 
  It was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner. It was      
only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of an        
husbandman) in a dish of about twenty-four feet in diameter. The            
company were the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old            
grandmother. When they sat down, the farmer placed me at some distance      
from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the floor. I         
was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the edge for      
fear of falling. The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled some          
bread on a trencher, and placed it before me. I made her a low bow,         
took out my knife and fork, and fell to eating, which gave them             
exceeding delight. The mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup,         
which held about three gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up         
the vessel with much difficulty in both hands, and in a most                
respectful manner drank to her ladyship's health, expressing the words      
as loud as I could in English, which made the company laugh so              
heartily, that I was almost deafened with the noise. This liquor            
tasted like a small cider, and was not unpleasant. Then the master          
made me a sign to come to his trencher side; but as I walked on the         
table, being in great surprise all the time, as the indulgent reader        
will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to stumble against a            
crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt. I got up             
immediately, and observing the good people to be in much concern, I         
took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners) and waving      
it over my head, made three huzzas, to show I had gotten no mischief        
by my fall. But advancing forwards toward my master (as I shall             
henceforth call him), his youngest son who sat next him, an arch boy        
of about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in      
the air, that I trembled every limb; but his father snatched me from        
him, and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear, as           
would have felled an European troop of horse to the earth, ordering         
him to be taken from the table. But being afraid the boy might owe          
me a spite, and well remembering how mischievous all children among us      
naturally are to sparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I        
fell on my knees, and pointing to the boy, made my master to                
understand, as well as I could, that I desired his son might be             
pardoned. The father complied, and the lad took his seat again;             
whereupon I went to him and kissed his hand, which my master took, and      
made him stroke me gently with it.                                          
  In the midst of dinner, my mistress' favorite cat leaped into her         
lap. I heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers        
at work; and turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of      
this animal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I           
computed by the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her            
mistress was feeding and stroking her. The fierceness of this               
creature's countenance altogether discomposed me; though I stood at         
the farther end of the table, above fifty feet off and although my          
mistress held her fast for fear she might give a spring, and seize          
me in her talons. But it happened there was no danger; for the cat          
took not the least notice of me when my master placed me within             
three yards of her. And as I have been always told, and found true          
by experience in my travels, that flying, or discovering fear way to        
make it pursue or attack you, so I resolved in this dangerous juncture      
to show no manner of concern. I walked with intrepidity five or six         
times before the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard          
of her; whereupon she drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of      
me: I had less apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four      
came into the room, as it is usual in farmers' houses; one of which         
was a mastiff, equal in bulk to four elephants, and a greyhound,            
somewhat taller than the mastiff, but not so large.                         
                                                    {P_2|CH_1 ^paragraph 10}
  When dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a Child of a          
year old in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall          
that you might have heard from London Bridge to Chelsea, after the          
usual oratory of infants, to get me for a plaything. The mother out of      
pure indulgence took me up, and put me towards the child, who               
presently seized me by the middle, and got my head in his mouth, where      
I roared so loud that the urchin was frightened, and let me drop;           
and I should infallibly have broken my neck if the mother had not held      
her apron under me. The nurse to quiet her babe made use of a               
rattle, which was a kind of hollow vessel filled with great stones,         
and fastened by a cable to the childs waist: but all in vain, so            
that she was forced to apply the last remedy by giving it suck. I must      
confess no object ever disgusted me so much as the sight of her             
monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to        
give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape and color. It stood      
prominent six feet, and could not be less than sixteen in                   
circumference. The nipple was about half the size of my head, and           
the hue both of that and the dug so varified with spots, pimples and        
freckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous: for I had a near         
sight of her, she sitting down the more conveniently to give suck, and      
I standing on the table. This made me reflect upon the fair skins of        
our English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they        
are of our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a         
magnifying glass, where we find by experiment that the smoothest and        
whitest skins look rough and coarse, and ill colored.                       
  I remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those                
diminutive people appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking      
upon this subject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate      
friend of mine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother      
when he looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view        
when I took him up in my hand and brought him close, which he               
confessed was at first a very shocking sight. He said he could              
discover great holes in my skin; that the stumps of my beard were           
ten times stronger than the bristles of a boar, and my complexion made      
up of several colors altogether disagreeable: although I must beg           
leave to say for myself, that I am as fair as most of my sex and            
country, and very little sunburned by all my travels. On the other          
side, discoursing of the ladies in that Emperor's court, he used to         
tell me, one had freckles, another too wide a mouth, a third too large      
a nose, nothing of which I was able to distinguish. I confess this          
reflection was obvious enough; which however I could not forbear, lest      
the reader might think those vast creatures were actually deformed:         
for I must do them justice to say they are a comely race of people;         
and particularly the features of my master's countenance, although          
he were but a farmer, when I beheld him from the height of sixty feet,      
appeared very well proportioned.                                            
  When dinner was done, my master went out to his laborers, and as I        
could discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife a strict charge      
to take care of me. I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep,           
which my mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered        
me with a clean white handkerchief, larger and coarser than the             
mainsail of a man of war.                                                   
  I slept about two hours, and dreamed I was at home with my wife           
and children, which aggravated my sorrows when I awakened and found         
myself alone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet             
wide, and above two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide. My      
mistress was gone about her household affairs, and had locked me in.        
The bed was eight yards from the floor. Some natural necessities            
required me to get down; I dare not presume to call, and if I had,          
it would have been in vain, with such a voice as mine, at so great a        
distance from the room where I lay to the kitchen where the family          
kept. While I was under these circumstances, two rats crept up the          
curtains, and ran smelling backwards and forwards on the bed. One of        
them came up almost to my face, whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew      
out my hanger to defend myself. These horrible animals had the              
boldness to attack me on both sides, and one of them held his               
fore-feet at my collar; but I had the good fortune to rip up his belly      
before he could do me any mischief. He fell down at my feet, and the        
other, seeing the fate of his comrade, made his escape, but not             
without one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled, and        
made the blood run trickling from him. After this exploit, I walked         
gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my breath and loss of              
spirits. These creatures were of the size of a large mastiff, but           
infinitely more nimble and fierce, so that if I had taken off my            
belt before I went to sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to            
pieces and devoured. I measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it      
to be two yards long, wanting an inch; but it went against my               
stomach to drag the carcass off the bed, where it lay still                 
bleeding; I observed it had yet some life, but with a strong slash          
cross the neck, I thoroughly dispatched it.                                 
  Soon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody,      
ran and took me up in her hand. I pointed to the dead rat, smiling and      
making other signs to show I was not hurt, whereat she was extremely        
rejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of           
tongs, and throw it out of the window. Then she set me on a table,          
where I showed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet        
of my coat, returned it to the scabbard. I was pressed to do more than      
one thing, which another could not do for me, and therefore endeavored      
to make my mistress understand that I desired to be set down on the         
floor; which after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to      
express myself farther than by pointing to the door, and bowing             
several times. The good woman with much difficulty at last perceived        
what I would be at, and taking me up again in her hand, walked into         
the garden, where she set me down. I went on one side about two             
hundred yards, and beckoning to her not to look or to follow me, I hid      
myself between two leaves of sorrel and there discharged the                
necessities of nature.

  I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and         
the like particulars, which however insignificant they may appear to        
grovelling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to           
enlarge his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of      
public as well as private life, which was my sole design in presenting      
this and other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have          
been chiefly studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of          
learning or of style. But the whole scene of this voyage made so            
strong an impression on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my               
memory, that in committing it to paper I did not omit one material          
circumstance: however, upon a strict review, I blotted out several          
passages of less moment which were in my first copy, for fear of being      
censured as tedious and trifling, whereof travelers are often, perhaps      
not without justice, accused.                                               
                                                                            
P_2|CH_2                                                                    
  CHAPTER II                                                                
-                                                                           
  My mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of forward          
parts for her age, very dextrous at her needle, and skillful in             
dressing her baby. Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby's        
cradle for me against night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of      
a cabinet, and the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of           
the rats. This was my bed all the time I stayed with those people,          
though made more convenient by degrees, as I began to learn their           
language, and make my wants known. This young girl was so handy,            
that after I had once or twice pulled off my clothes before her, she        
was able to dress and undress me, though I never gave her that trouble      
when she would let me do either myself. She made me seven shirts,           
and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be got, which indeed        
was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly washed for me          
with her own hands. She was likewise my school mistress to teach me         
the language: when I pointed to anything, she told me the name of it        
in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call for             
whatever I had a mind to. She was very good-natured, and not above          
forty feet high, being little for her age. She gave me the name of          
Grildrig, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole                
kingdom. The word imports what the Latins call nanunculus the Italians      
homunceletino, and the English mannikin. To her I chiefly owe my            
preservation in that country: we never parted while I was there; I          
called her my Glumdalclitch, or little nurse: and I should be guilty        
of great ingratitude if I omitted this honorable mention of her care        
and affection towards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my power          
to requite as she deserves, instead of being the innocent but               
unhappy instrument of her disgrace, as I have too much reason to fear.      
  It now began to be known and talked of in the neighborhood, that          
my master had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness        
of a splacknuck, but exactly shaped in every part like a human              
creature; which it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to          
speak in a little language of its own, had already learned several          
words of theirs, went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle,             
would come when it was called, do whatever it was bid, had the              
finest limbs in the world, and a complexion fairer than a nobleman's        
daughter of three years old. Another farmer who lived hard by, and was      
a particular friend of my master, came on a visit on purpose to             
inquire into the truth of this story. I was immediately produced,           
and placed upon a table, where I walked as I was commanded, drew my         
hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my master's guest, asked      
him in his own language how he did, and told him he was welcome,            
just as my little nurse had instructed me. This man, who was old and        
dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better, at which I          
could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes appeared like        
the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows. Our people, who        
discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in laughing, at           
which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of                 
countenance. He had the character of a great miser, and to my               
misfortune he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master      
to show me as a sight upon a market day in the next town, which was         
half an hour's riding, about twenty-two miles from our house. I             
guessed there was some mischief contriving, when I observed my              
master and his friend whispering long together, sometimes pointing          
at me; and my fears made me fancy that I overheard and understood some      
of their words. But the next morning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse,        
told me the whole matter, which she had cunningly picked out from           
her mother. The poor girl laid me on her bosom, and fell weeping            
with shame and grief. She apprehended some mischief would happen to me      
from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me to death, or break one of      
my limbs by taking me in their hands. She had also observed how modest      
I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my honor, and what an             
indignity I should conceive it to be exposed for money as a public          
spectacle to the meanest of the people. She said, her papa and mamma        
had promised that Grildrig should be hers, but now she found they           
meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended to            
give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher.      
For my own part, I may truly affirm that I was less concerned than          
my nurse. I had a strong hope which never left me, that I should one        
day recover my liberty; and as to the ignominy of being carried             
about for a monster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in        
the country, and that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me      
as a reproach, if ever I should return to England; since the King of        
Great Britain himself, in my condition, must have undergone the same        
distress.                                                                   
  My master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box      
the next market day to the neighboring town, and took along with him        
his little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him. The box           
was close on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out,        
and a few gimlet holes to let in air. The girl had been so careful          
to put the quilt of her baby's bed into it, for me to lie down on.          
However, I was terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though      
it were but of half an hour. For the horse went about forty feet at         
every step, and trotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the        
rising and falling of a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent.      
Our journey was somewhat further than from London to St. Albans. My         
master alighted at an inn which he used to frequent; and after              
consulting a while with the inn-keeper, and making some necessary           
preparations, he hired the Grultrud, or crier, to give notice               
through the town of a strange creature to be seen at the Sign of the        
Green Eagle, not so big as a splacknuck (an animal in that country          
very finely shaped, about six foot long) and in every part of the body      
resembling a human creature, could speak several words, and perform         
a hundred diverting tricks.                                                 
  I was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which           
might be near three hundred feet square. My little nurse stood on a         
low stool close to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I         
should do. My master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty            
people at a time to see me. I walked about on the table as the girl         
commanded: she asked me questions as far as she knew my                     
understanding of the language reached, and I answered them as loud          
as I could. I turned about several times to the company, paid my            
humble respects, said they were welcome, and used some other                
speeches I had been taught. I took up a thimble filled with liquor,         
which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their health.         
I drew out my hanger, and flourished it after the manner of fencers in      
England. My nurse gave me part of a straw, which I exercised as a           
pike, having learned the art in my youth. I was that day shown to           
twelve sets of company, and as often forced to go over again with           
the same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and                 
vexation. For those who had seen me made such wonderful reports,            
that the people were ready to break down the doors to come in. My           
master for his own interest would not suffer any one to touch me            
except my nurse; and, to prevent danger, benches were set around the        
table at such a distance as put me out of everybody's reach.                
However, an unlucky schoolboy aimed a hazel nut directly at my head,        
which very narrowly missed me; otherwise, it came with so much              
violence, that it would have infallibly knocked out my brains, for          
it was almost as large as a small pumpion: but I had the                    
satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the      
room.                                                                       
  My master gave public notice that he would show me again the next         
market day, and in the meantime he prepared a more convenient               
vehicle for me, which he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired        
with my first journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours        
together, that I could hardly stand upon my legs or speak a word. It        
was at least three days before I recovered my strength; and that I          
might have no rest at home, all the neighboring gentlemen from a            
hundred miles around, hearing of my fame, came to see me at my              
master's own house. There could not be fewer than thirty persons            
with their wives and children (for the country is very populous);           
and my master demanded the rate of a full room whenever he showed me        
at home, although it were only to a single family; so that for some         
time I had but little ease every day of the week (except Wednesday,         
which is their Sabbath) although I were not carried to the town.            
                                                     {P_2|CH_2 ^paragraph 5}
  My master, finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to         
carry me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom. Having             
therefore provided himself with all things necessary for a long             
journey, and settled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife,        
and upon the 17th of August, 1703, about two months after my                
arrival, we set out for the metropolis, situated near the middle of         
that empire, and about three thousand miles distance from our house.        
My master made his daughter Glumdalclitch ride behind him. She carried      
me on her lap in a box tied about her waist. The girl had lined it          
on all sides with the softest cloth she could get, well quilted             
underneath, furnished it with her baby's bed, provided me with linen        
and other necessaries, and made everything as convenient as she could.      
We had no other company but a boy of the house, who rode after us with      
the luggage.                                                                
  My master's design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and        
to step out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village        
or person of quality's house where he might expect custom. We made          
easy journeys of not above seven or eight score miles a day: for            
Glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with        
the trotting of the horse. She often took me out of my box at my own        
desire, to give me air and show me the country, but always held me          
fast by a leading string. We passed over five or six rivers many            
degrees broader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges; and there           
was hardly a rivulet so small as the Thames at London Bridge. We            
were ten weeks in our journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns      
besides many villages and private families.                                 
  On the 26th day of October, we arrived at the metropolis, called          
in their language Lorbrulgrud, or Pride of the Universe. My master          
took a lodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the        
royal palace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact      
description of my person and parts. He hired a large room between           
three and four hundred feet wide. He provided a table sixty feet in         
diameter, upon which I was to act my part, and palisadoed it around         
three feet from the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling           
over. I was shown ten times a day to the wonder and satisfaction of         
all people. I could now speak the language tolerably well, and              
perfectly understood every word that was spoken to me. Besides, I           
had learned their alphabet, and could make a shift to explain a             
sentence here and there; for Glumdalclitch had been my instructor           
while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our journey. She         
carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a Sanson's        
Atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls, giving a        
short account of their religion: out of this she taught me my letters,      
and interpreted the words.                                                  
                                                                            
P_2|CH_3                                                                    
  CHAPTER III                                                               
-                                                                           
  The frequent labors I underwent every day made in a few weeks a very      
considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the         
more unsatiable he grew. I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost        
reduced to a skeleton. The farmer observed it, and concluding I soon        
must die, resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could. While          
he was thus reasoning and resolving with himself, a Slardral, or            
Gentleman Usher, came from court, commanding my master to carry me          
immediately thither for the diversion of the Queen and her ladies.          
Some of the latter had already been to see me, and reported strange         
things of my beauty, behavior, and good sense. Her Majesty and those        
who attended her were beyond measure delighted with my demeanor. I          
fell on my knees, and begged the honor of kissing her Imperial foot;        
but this gracious princess held out her little finger towards me            
(after I was set on a table) which I embraced in both my arms, and put      
the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip. She made me some           
general questions about my country and my travels, which I answered as      
distinctly and in as few words as I could. She asked whether I would        
be content to live at court. I bowed down to the board of the table,        
and humbly answered, that I was my master's slave, but if I were at my      
own disposal, I should be proud to devote my life to her Majesty's          
service. She then asked my master whether he were willing to sell me        
at a good price. He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was          
ready enough to part with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of             
gold, which were ordered him on the spot, each piece being about the        
bigness of eight hundred moidores; but, allowing for the proportion of      
all things between that country and Europe, and the high price of gold      
among them, was hardly so great a sum as a thousand guineas would be        
in England. I then said to the Queen, since I was now her Majesty's         
most humble creature and vassal, I must beg the favor, that                 
Glumdalclitch, who had always tended me with so much care and               
kindness, and understood to do it so well, might be admitted into           
her service, and continue to be my nurse and instructor. Her Majesty        
agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer's consent, who was         
glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court: and the poor girl      
herself was not able to hide her joy. My late master withdrew, bidding      
me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to which I        
replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.                           
  The Queen observed my coldness, and when the farmer was gone out          
of the apartment, asked me the reason. I made bold to tell her Majesty      
that I owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not             
dashing out the brains of a poor harmless creature found by chance          
in his field; which obligation was amply recompensed by the gain he         
had made in showing me through half the kingdom, and the price he           
had now sold me for. That the life I had since led was laborious            
enough to kill an animal of ten times my strength. That my health           
was much impaired by the continual drudgery of entertaining the rabble      
every hour of the day, and that if my master had not thought my life        
in danger, her Majesty perhaps would not have got so cheap a                
bargain. But as I was out of all fear of being ill treated under the        
protection of so great and good an Empress, the Ornament of Nature,         
the Darling of the World, the Delight of her Subjects, the Phoenix          
of the Creation; so I hoped my late master's apprehensions would            
appear to be groundless, for I already found my spirits to revive by        
the influence of her most august presence.                                  
  This was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties         
and hesitation; the latter part was altogether framed in the style          
peculiar to that people, whereof I learned some phrases from                
Glumdalclitch, while she was carrying me to court.                          
  The Queen giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking,        
was however surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive        
an animal. She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the King,         
who was then retired to his cabinet. His Majesty, a prince of much          
gravity, and austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first      
view, asked the Queen after a cold manner, how long it was since she        
grew fond of a splacknuck; for such it seems he took me to be, as I         
lay upon my breast in her Majesty's right hand. But this princess, who      
has an infinite deal of wit and humor, set me gently on my feet upon        
the scrutore, and commanded me to give his Majesty an account of            
myself, which I did in a very few words; and Glumdalclitch, who             
attended at the cabinet door, and could not endure I should be out          
of her sight, being admitted, confirmed all that had passed from my         
arrival at her father's house.                                              
  The King, although he be as learned a person as any in his                
dominions, and had been educated in the study of philosophy, and            
particularly mathematics; yet when he observed my shape exactly, and        
saw me walk erect, before I began to speak, conceived I might be a          
piece of clockwork (which is in that country arrived to a very great        
perfection), contrived by some ingenious artist. But when he heard          
my voice, and found what I delivered to be regular and rational, he         
could not conceal his astonishment. He was by no means satisfied            
with the relation I gave him of the manner I came into his kingdom,         
but thought it a story concerted between Glumdalclitch and her father,      
who had taught me a set of words to make me sell at a higher price.         
Upon this imagination he put several other questions to me, and             
still received rational answers, no otherwise defective than by a           
foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the language, with            
some rustic phrases which I had learned at the farmer's house, and did      
not suit the polite style of a court.                                       
                                                     {P_2|CH_3 ^paragraph 5}
  His Majesty sent for three great scholars who were then in their          
weekly waiting, according to the custom in that country. These              
gentlemen, after they had awhile examined my shape with much nicety,        
were of different opinions concerning me. They all agreed that I could      
not be produced according to the regular laws of nature, because I was      
not framed with a capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness,      
or climbing of trees, or digging holes in the earth. They observed          
by my teeth, which they viewed with great exactness, that I was a           
carnivorous animal; yet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and      
field mice, with some others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I      
should be able to support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other        
insects, which they offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that      
I could not possibly do. One of these virtuosi seemed to think that         
I might be an embryo, or abortive birth. But this opinion was rejected      
by the other two, who observed my limbs to be perfect and finished,         
and that I had lived several years, as it was manifested from my            
beard, the stumps whereof they plainly discovered through a magnifying      
glass. They would not allow me to be a dwarf, because my littleness         
was beyond all degrees of comparison; for the Queen's favorite              
dwarf, the smallest ever known in that kingdom, was nearly thirty feet      
high. After much debate, they concluded unanimously that I was only         
relplum scalcath, which is interpreted literally, lusus naturae; a          
determination exactly agreeable to the modern philosophy of Europe,         
whose professors, disdaining the old evasion of occult causes, whereby      
the followers of Artistotle endeavor in vain to disguise their              
ignorance, have invented this wonderful solution of all                     
difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human knowledge.            
  After this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or         
two. I applied myself to the King, and assured his Majesty, that I          
came from a country which abounded with several millions of both            
sexes, and of my own stature; where the animals, trees, and houses          
were all in proportion, and where by consequence I might be as able to      
defend myself, and to find sustenance, as any of his Majesty's              
subjects could do here; which I took for a full answer to those             
gentlemen's arguments. To this they only replied with a smile of            
contempt, saying that the farmer had instructed me very well in my          
lesson. The King, who had a much better understanding, dismissing           
his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by good fortune was not           
yet gone out of town. Having therefore first examined him privately,        
and then confronted him with me and the young girl, his Majesty             
began to think that what we told him might possibly be true. He             
desired the Queen to order that a particular care should be taken of        
me, and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue in her      
office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection for      
each other. A convenient apartment was provided for her at court;           
she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a      
maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but           
the care of me was wholly appropriated to herself. The Queen commanded      
her own cabinet maker to contrive a box that might serve me for a           
bedchamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree           
upon. This man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my             
directions, in three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen      
feet square, and twelve high, with sash windows, a door, and two            
closets, like a London bedchamber. The board that made the ceiling was      
to be lifted up and down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready               
furnished by her Majesty's upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out        
every day to air, made it with her own hands, and letting it down at        
night, locked up the roof over me. A nice workman, who was famous           
for little curiosities, undertook to make me two chairs, with backs         
and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory, and two tables, with a         
cabinet to put my things in. The room was quilted on all sides, as          
well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any accident from the         
carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the force of a jolt      
when I went in a coach. I desired a lock for my door, to prevent            
rats and mice from coming in: the smith, after several attempts,            
made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have known a         
larger at the gate of a gentleman's house in England. I made a shift        
to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might          
lose it. The Queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be        
gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an English                
blanket, very cumbersome till I was accustomed to them. They were           
after the fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian, and        
partly the Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.                  
  The Queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine           
without me. I had a table placed upon the same at which her Majesty         
ate, just at her left elbow, and a chair to sit on. Glumdalclitch           
stood upon a stool on the floor, near my table, to assist and take          
care of me. I had an entire set of silver dishes and plates, and other      
necessaries, which, in proportion to those of the Queen, were not much      
bigger than what I have seen of the same kind in a London toy shop,         
for the furniture of a babyhouse: these my little nurse kept in her         
pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as I wanted them,              
always cleaning them herself. No person dined with the Queen but the        
two Princesses Royal, the elder sixteen years old, and the younger          
at that time thirteen and a month. Her Majesty used to put a bit of         
meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself, and           
her diversion was to see me eat in miniature. For the Queen (who had        
indeed but a weak stomach) took up at one mouthful as much as a             
dozen English farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some         
time a very nauseous sight. She would crunch the wing of a lark, bones      
and all, between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as         
that of a full grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth, as      
big as two twelve-penny loaves. She drank out of a golden cup, above a      
hogshead at a draught. Her knives were twice as long as a scythe set        
straight upon the handle. The spoons, forks, and other instruments          
were all in the same proportion. I remember when Glumdalclitch carried      
me out of curiosity to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a      
dozen of these enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I         
thought I had never till then beheld so terrible a sight.                   
  It is the custom that every Wednesday (which, as I have before            
observed, was their Sabbath) the King and Queen, with the royal             
issue of both sexes, dine together in the apartment of his Majesty, to      
whom I was now become a great favorite; and at these times my little        
chair and table were placed at his left hand, before one of the salt        
cellars. This prince took a pleasure in conversing with me,                 
inquiring into the manners, religion, laws, government, and learning        
of Europe; wherein I gave him the best account I was able. His              
apprehension was so clear, and his judgment so exact, that he made          
very wise reflections and observations upon all I said. But, I              
confess, that after I had been a little too copious in talking of my        
own beloved country, of our trade, and wars by sea and land, of our         
schisms in religion, and parties in the state, the prejudices of his        
education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear taking me up          
in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other, after an          
hearty fit of laughing, asked me whether I were a Whig or a Tory. Then      
turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white           
staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he              
observed how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be        
mimicked by such diminutive insects as I: and yet, said he, I dare          
engage, these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honor,        
they contrive little nests and burrows, that they call houses and           
cities; they make a figure in dress and equipage; they love, they           
fight, they dispute, they cheat, they betray. And thus he continued         
on, while my color came and went several times with indignation to          
hear our noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge          
of France, the arbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honor        
and truth, the pride and envy of the world, contemptuously treated.         
  But as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so, upon              
mature thoughts, I began to doubt whether I were injured or not.            
For, after having been accustomed several months to the sight and           
converse of this people, and observed every object upon which I cast        
my eyes to be of proportionable magnitude, the horror I had first           
conceived from their bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I         
had then beheld a company of English lords and ladies in their              
finery and best day clothes, acting their several parts in the most         
courtly manner, of strutting, and bowing, and prating, to say the           
truth, I should have been strongly tempted to laugh as much at them as      
the King and his grandees did at me. Neither indeed could I forbear         
smiling at myself, when the Queen used to place me upon her hand            
towards a looking glass, by which both our persons appeared before          
me in full view together! and there could be nothing more ridiculous        
than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself dwindled      
many degrees below my usual size.                                           
                                                    {P_2|CH_3 ^paragraph 10}
  Nothing angered and mortified me so much as the Queen's dwarf, who        
being of the lowest stature that was ever that country (for I verily        
think he was not thirty feet high) became insolent at seeing a              
creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger        
and look big as he passed by me in the Queen's antechamber, while I         
was standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the          
court, and he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness;      
against which I could only revenge myself by calling him brother,           
challenging him to wrestle, and such repartees as are usual in the          
mouths of court pages. One day at dinner this malicious little cub was      
so nettled with something I had said to him, that raising himself upon      
the frame of her Majesty's chair, he took me up by the middle, as I         
was sitting down, not thinking any harm, and let me drop into a             
large silver bowl of cream, and then ran away as fast as he could. I        
fell over head and ears, and if I had not been a good swimmer, it           
might have gone very hard with me; for Glumdalclitch in that instant        
happened to be at the other end of the room, and the Queen was in such      
a fright that she wanted presence of mind to assist me. But my              
little nurse ran to my relief, and took me out, after I had                 
swallowed above a quart of cream. I was put to bed; however, I              
received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes, which was      
utterly spoiled. The dwarf was soundly whipped, and as a farther            
punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream, into which he had         
thrown me; neither was he ever restored to favor; for soon after the        
Queen bestowed him to a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no          
more, to my very great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what           
extremity such a malicious urchin might have carried his resentment.        
  He had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the Queen a             
laughing, although at the same time she was heartily vexed, and             
would have immediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as      
to intercede. Her Majesty had taken a marrow bone upon her plate,           
and after knocking out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish        
erect as it stood before; the dwarf watching his opportunity, while         
Glumdalclitch was gone to the sideboard, mounted upon the stool she         
stood on to take care of me at meals, took me up in both hands, and         
squeezing my legs together, wedged them into the marrow bone above          
my waist, where I stuck for some time, and made a very ridiculous           
figure. I believe it was near a minute before any one knew what was         
become of me, for I thought it below me to cry out. But, as princes         
seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not scalded, only my stockings      
and breeches in a sad condition. The dwarf at my entreaty had no other      
punishment than a sound whipping.                                           
  I was frequently rallied by the Queen upon account of my                  
fearfulness, and she used to ask me whether the people of ray               
country were as great cowards as myself. The occasion was this. The         
kingdom is much pestered with flies in summer; and these odious             
insects, each of them as big as a Dunstable lark, hardly gave me any        
rest while I sat at dinner, with their continual humming and buzzing        
about my ears. They would sometimes alight upon my victuals; and leave      
their loathsome excrement or spawn behind, which to me was very             
visible, though not to the natives of that country, whose large optics      
were not so acute as mine in viewing smaller objects. Sometimes they        
would fix upon my nose or forehead, where they stung me to the              
quick, smelling very offensively, and I could easily trace that             
viscous matter, which our naturalists tell us enables those                 
creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling. I had much        
ado to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not        
forbear starting when they came on my face. It was the common practice      
of the dwarf to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as             
schoolboys do among us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on         
purpose to frighten me, and divert the Queen. My remedy was to cut          
them in pieces with my knife as they flew in the air, wherein my            
dexterity was much admired.                                                 
  I remember one morning when Glumdalclitch had set me in my box            
upon a window, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for I        
dared not venture to let the box be hung on a nail out of the               
window, as we do with cages in England) after I had lifted up one of        
my sashes, and sat down at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for        
my breakfast, above twenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying         
into the room, humming louder than the drones of as many bagpipes.          
Some of them seized my cake, and carried it piecemeal away, others          
flew about my head and face, confounding me with the noise, and             
putting me in the utmost terror of their stings. However I had the          
courage to rise and draw my hanger, and attack them in the air. I           
dispatched four of them, but the rest got away, and I presently shut        
my window. These insects were as large as partridges: I took out their      
stings, found them an inch and a half long, and as sharp as needles. I      
carefully preserved them all, and having since shown them with some         
other curiosities in several parts of Europe, upon my return to             
England I gave three of them to Gresham College, and kept the fourth        
for myself.                                                                 
                                                                            
P_2|CH_4                                                                    
  CHAPTER IV                                                                
-                                                                           
  I now intend to give the reader a short description of this country,      
as far as I traveled in it, which was not above two thousand miles          
round Lorbrulgrud, the metropolis. For the Queen, whom I always             
attended, never went further when she accompanied the King in his           
progresses, and there stayed until his Majesty returned from viewing        
his frontiers. The whole extent of this prince's dominions reaches          
about six thousand miles in length, and from three to five in breadth.      
From whence I cannot but conclude that our geographers of Europe are        
in a great error, by supposing nothing but sea between Japan and            
California; for it was ever my opinion, that there must be a balance        
of earth to counterpoise the great continent of Tartary; and therefore      
they ought to correct their maps and charts, by joining this vast           
tract of land to the northwest parts of America, wherein I shall be         
ready to lend them my assistance.                                           
  The kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the northeast by a ridge        
of mountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable by          
reason of the volcanoes upon the tops. Neither do the most learned          
know what sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether        
they be inhabited at all. On the three other sides it is bounded by         
the ocean. There is not one seaport in the whole kingdom, and those         
parts of the coasts into which the rivers issue are so full of pointed      
rocks, and the sea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with      
the smallest of their boats, so that these people are wholly                
excluded from any commerce with the rest of the world. But the large        
rivers are full of vessels, and abound with excellent fish, for they        
seldom get any from the sea because the sea fish are of the same            
size with those in Europe, and consequently not worth catching;             
whereby it is manifest, that nature, in the production of plants and        
animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is wholly confined to this              
continent, of which I leave the reasons to be determined by                 
philosophers. However, now and then they take a whale that happens          
to be dashed against the rocks, which the common people feed on             
heartily. These whales I have known so large that a man could hardly        
carry one upon his shoulders; and sometimes for curiosity they are          
brought in hampers to Lorbrulgrud: I saw one of them in a dish at           
the King's table, which passed for a rarity, but I did not observe          
he was fond of it; for I think indeed the bigness disgusted him,            
although I have seen one somewhat larger in Greenland.                      
  The country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities,          
near a hundred walled towns, and a great number of villages. To             
satisfy my curious reader, it may be sufficient to describe                 
Lorbrulgrud. This city stands upon almost two equal parts on each side      
the river that passes through. It contains above eighty thousand            
houses, and about six hundred thousand inhabitants. It is in length         
three glonglungs (which make about fifty-four English miles) and two        
and a half in breadth, as I measured it myself in the royal map made        
by the King's order, which was laid on the ground on purpose for me,        
and extended a hundred feet; I paced the diameter and circumference         
several times barefoot, and computing by the scale, measured it pretty      
exactly.                                                                    
  The King's palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of building           
about seven miles around: the chief rooms are generally two hundred         
and forty feet high, and broad and long proportion. A coach was             
allowed to Glumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took      
her out to see the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of         
the party, carried in my box; although the girl at my own desire would      
often take me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more               
conveniently view the houses and the people, as we passed along the         
streets. I reckoned our coach to be about a square of Westminster           
Hall, but not altogether so high; however, I cannot be very exact. One      
day the governess ordered our coachman to stop at several shops, where      
the beggars, watching their opportunity, crowded to the sides of the        
coach, and gave me the most horrible spectacles that ever an English        
eye beheld. There was a woman with a cancer in her breast, swelled          
to a monstrous size, full of holes, in two or three of which I could        
have easily crept, and covered my whole body. There was a fellow            
with a wen in his neck, larger than five wool-packs, and another            
with a couple of wooden legs, each about twenty feet high. But the          
most hateful sight of all was the lice crawling on their clothes. I         
could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my naked eye, much      
better than those of an European louse through a microscope, and their      
snouts with which they rooted like swine. They were the first I had         
ever beheld, and I should have been curious enough to dissect one of        
them, if I had proper instruments (which I unluckily left behind me in      
the shop) although indeed the sight was so nauseous, that it perfectly      
turned my stomach.                                                          
  Besides the large box in which I was usually carried, the Queen           
ordered a smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet               
square, and ten high, for the convenience of traveling, because the         
other was somewhat too large for Glumdalclitch's lap, and cumbersome        
in the coach; it was made by the same artist, whom I directed in the        
whole contrivance. This traveling closet was an exact square with a         
window in the middle of three of the squares, and each window was           
latticed with iron wire on the outside, to prevent accidents in long        
journeys. On the fourth side, which had no window, two strong               
staples were fixed, through which the person that carried me, when I        
had a mind to be on horseback, put in a leathern belt, and buckled          
it about his waist. This was always the office of some grave trusty         
servant in whom I could confide, whether I attended the King and Queen      
in their progresses, or were disposed to see the gardens, or pay a          
visit to some great lady or minister of state in the court, when            
Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order: for I soon began to be           
known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose more upon         
account of their Majesties' favor, than any merit of my own. In             
journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback             
would buckle my box, and place it on a cushion before him; and there I      
had a full prospect of the country on three sides from my three             
windows. I had in this closet a field bed and a hung from the ceiling,      
two chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent             
being tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach. And          
having been long used to sea voyages, those motions, although               
sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me.                         
                                                     {P_2|CH_4 ^paragraph 5}
  Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my traveling      
closet, which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open sedan,        
after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended by        
two others in the Queen's livery. The people who had often heard of         
me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was            
complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her          
hand that I might be more conveniently seen.                                
  I was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the         
tower belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.        
Accordingly, one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly           
say I came back disappointed; for height is not above three thousand        
feet, reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which          
allowing for the difference between the size of those people and us in      
Europe, is no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in              
proportion (if I rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple. But, not to        
detract from a nation to which during my life I shall acknowledge           
myself extremely obliged, it must be allowed that whatever this famous      
tower wants in height is amply made up in beauty and strength. For the      
walls are near a hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each      
is about forty feet square, and adorned on all sides with statues of        
gods and emperors cut in marble larger than the life, placed in             
their several niches. I measured a little finger which had fallen down      
from one of these statues, and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and      
found it exactly four feet and an inch in length. Glumdalclitch             
wrapped it up in a handkerchief, and carried it home in her pocket          
to keep among other trinkets, of which the girl was very fond, as           
children at her age usually are.                                            
  The King's kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and        
about six hundred feet high. The great oven is not so wide by ten           
yards as the cupola at St. Paul's; for I measured the latter on             
purpose after my return. But if I should describe the kitchen grate,        
the prodigious pots and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the          
spits, with many other particulars, perhaps I should be hardly              
believed; at least a severe critic would be apt to think I enlarged         
a little, as travelers are often suspected to do. To avoid which            
censure, I fear I have run too much into the other extreme; and that        
if this treatise should happen to be translated into the language of        
Brobdingnag (which is the general name of that kingdom) and                 
transmitted thither, the King and his people would have reason to           
complain that I had done them an injury by a false and diminutive           
representation.                                                             
  His Majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables:         
they are generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high. But when he          
goes abroad on solemn days, he is attended for state by a militia           
guard of five hundred horse, which indeed I thought was the most            
splendid sight that could be ever beheld, till I saw part of his            
army in battalia, whereof I shall find another occasion to speak.           
                                                                            
P_2|CH_5                                                                    
  CHAPTER V                                                                 
-                                                                           
  I should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness        
had not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents,         
some of which I shall venture to relate. Glumdalclitch often carried        
me into the gardens of the court in my smaller box, and would               
sometimes take me out of it and hold me in her hand, or set me down to      
walk. I remember, before the dwarf left the Queen, he followed us           
one day into those gardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and         
I being close together, near some dwarf apple trees, I must needs show      
my wit by a silly allusion between him and the trees, which happens to      
hold in their language as it does in ours. Whereupon, the malicious         
rogue watching his opportunity, when I was walking under one of             
them, shook it directly over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of      
them near as large as a Bristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears;        
one of them hit me on the back as I chanced to stoop, and knocked me        
down flat on my face, but I received no other hurt, and the dwarf           
was pardoned at my desire, because I had given the provocation.             
  Another day Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass plot to divert        
myself while she walked at some distance with her governess. In the         
meantime there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was      
immediately by the force of it struck to the ground: and when I was         
down, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if      
I had been pelted with tennis balls; however, I made a shift to             
creep on all fours, and shelter myself by lying flat on my face on the      
lee side of a border of lemon thyme, but so bruised from head to            
foot that I could not go abroad in ten days. Neither is this at all to      
be wondered at, because nature in that country observing the same           
proportion through all her operations, a hailstone is near eighteen         
hundred times as large as one in Europe, which I can assert upon            
experience, having been so curious to weigh and measure them.               
  But a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden,          
when my little nurse believing she had put me in a secure place, which      
I often entreated her to do, that might enjoy my own thoughts, and          
having left my box at home to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went        
to another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of         
her acquaintance. While she was absent and out of hearing, a small          
white spaniel belonging to one of the chief gardeners, having got by        
accident into the garden, happened to range near the place where I          
lay. The dog following the scent, came directly up, and taking me in        
his mouth, ran straight to his master, wagging his tail, and set me         
gently on the ground. By good fortune he had been so well taught, that      
I was carried between his teeth without the least hurt, or even             
tearing my clothes. But the poor gardener, who knew me well, and had a      
great kindness for me, was in a terrible fright. He gently took me          
up in both his hands, and asked me how I did; but I was so amazed           
and out of breath, that I could not speak a word. In a few minutes I        
came to myself, and he carried me safe to my little nurse, who by this      
time had returned to the place where she left me, and was in cruel          
agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when she called: she              
severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog. But the thing      
was hushed up, and never known at court; for the girl was afraid of         
the Queen's anger, and truly as to myself, I thought it would not be        
for my reputation that such a story should go about.                        
  This accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust          
me abroad for the future out of her sight. I had been long afraid of        
this resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little               
unlucky adventures that happened in those times when I was left by          
myself. Once a kite hovering over the garden made a swoop at me, and        
if I had not resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick              
espalier, he would have certainly carried me away in his talons.            
Another time walking to the top of a fresh molehill, I fell to my neck      
in the hole through which that animal had cast up the earth, and            
coined some lie, not worth remembering, to excuse myself for                
spoiling my clothes. I likewise broke my right shin against the             
shell of a snail, which I happened to stumble over, as I was walking        
alone, and thinking on poor England.                                        
  I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified, to observe        
in those solitary walks that the smaller birds did not appear to be at      
all afraid of me, but would hop about within a yard's distance,             
looking for worms and other food with as much indifference and              
security as if no creature at all were near them. I remember a              
thrush had the confidence to snatch out of my hand with his bill a          
piece of cake that Glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast.        
When I attempted to catch any of these birds, they would boldly turn        
against me, endeavoring to pick my fingers, which I dared not               
venture within their reach; and then they would hop back unconcerned        
to hunt for worms or snails, as they did before. But one day I took         
a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my strength so luckily at a           
linnet that I knocked him down, and seizing him by the neck with            
both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse. However, the bird,      
who had only been stunned, recovering himself, gave me so many boxes        
with his wings on both sides of my head and body, though I held him at      
arm's length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I was twenty      
times thinking to let him go. But I was soon relieved by one of our         
servants, who wrung off the bird's neck, and I had him next day for         
dinner, by the Queen's command. This as near as I can remember, to          
be somewhat larger than an English swan.                                    
                                                     {P_2|CH_5 ^paragraph 5}
  The Maids of Honor often invited Glumdalclitch to their                   
apartments, and desired she would bring me along with her, on               
purpose to have the pleasure of seeing and touching me. They would          
often strip me naked from top to toe, and lay me at full length in          
their bosoms; wherewith I was much disgusted; because, to say the           
truth, a very offensive smell came from their skins; which I do not         
mention or intend to the disadvantage of those excellent ladies, for        
whom I have all manner of respect; but I conceive that my sense was         
more acute in proportion to my littleness, and that those                   
illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers, or to        
each other, than people of the same quality are with us in England.         
And, after all, I found their natural smell was much more                   
supportable than when they used perfumes, under which I immediately         
swooned away. I cannot forget that an intimate friend of mine in            
Lilliput took the freedom in a warm day, when I had used a good deal        
of exercise, to complain of a strong smell about me, although I am          
as little faulty that way as most of my sex: but I suppose his faculty      
of smelling was as nice with regard to me, as mine was to that of this      
people. Upon this point, I cannot forbear doing justice to the Queen        
my mistress, and Glumdalclitch my nurse, whose persons were as sweet        
as those of any lady in England.                                            
  That which gave me most uneasiness among these Maids of Honor,            
when my nurse carried me to visit them, was to see them use me without      
any manner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of                  
consequence. For they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on        
their smocks in my presence, while I was placed on their toilet             
directly before their naked bodies, which, I am sure, to me was very        
far from being a tempting sight, or from giving me any other                
emotions than those of horror and disgust. Their skins appeared so          
coarse and uneven, so variously colored, when I saw them near, with         
a mole here and there as broad as a trencher, and hairs hanging from        
it thicker than packthreads, to say nothing further concerning the          
rest of their persons. Neither did they at all scruple, while I was         
by, to discharge what they had drunk, to the quantity of at least           
two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above three tons. The                  
handsomest among these Maids of Honor, a pleasant frolicsome girl of        
sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples,            
with many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not           
being over particular. But I was so much displeased, that I                 
entreated Glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for not seeing that         
young lady any more.                                                        
  One day a young gentleman, who was a nephew to my nurse's governess,      
came and pressed them both to see an execution. It was of a man who         
had murdered one of that gentleman's intimate acquaintance.                 
Glumdalclitch was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against      
her inclination, for she was naturally tender-hearted; and as for           
myself, although I abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my                 
curiosity tempted me to see something that I thought must be                
extraordinary. The malefactor was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold          
erected for the purpose, and his head cut off at a blow with a sword        
of about forty foot long. The veins and arteries spouted up such a          
prodigious quantity of blood, and so high in the air, that the great        
jet d'eau at Versailles was not equal for the time it lasted; and           
the head, when it fell on the scaffold floor, gave such a bounce, as        
made me start, although I were at least half an English mile distant.       
  The Queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea voyages, and          
took all occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me             
whether I understood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a          
little exercise of rowing might not be convenient for my health. I          
answered that I understood both very well. For, although my proper          
employment had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet upon a         
pinch, I was forced to work like a common mariner. But I could not see      
how this could be done in their country, where the smallest wherry was      
equal to a first-rate man of war among us, and such a boat as I             
could manage would never live in any of their rivers. Her Majesty           
said, if I would contrive a boat, her own joiner should make it, and        
she would provide a place for me to sail in. The fellow was an              
ingenious workman, and by my instructions in ten days finished a            
pleasure boat with all its tackling, able conveniently to hold eight        
Europeans. When it was finished, the Queen was so delighted, that           
she ran with it in her lap to the King, who ordered it to be put in         
a cistern full of water, with me in it, by way of trial; where I could      
not manage my two sculls, or little oars, for want of room. But the         
Queen had before contrived another project. She ordered the joiner          
to make a wooden trough of three hundred feet long, fifty broad, and        
eight deep; which being well pitched to prevent leaking, was placed on      
the floor along the wall, in an outer room of the palace. It had a          
cock near the bottom to let out the water when it began to grow stale,      
and two servants could easily fill it in half an hour. Here I often         
used to row for my own diversion, as well as that of the Queen and her      
ladies, who thought themselves well entertained with my skill and           
agility. Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my business was         
only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and         
when they were weary, some of the pages would blow my sail forward          
with their breath, while I showed my art steering starboard or              
larboard as I pleased. When I had done, Glumdalclitch always carried        
my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.                      
  In this exercise I once met an accident which had like to have            
cost me my life. For one of the pages having put my boat into the           
trough, the governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously           
lifted me up to place me in the boat, but I happened to slip through        
her fingers, and should have infallibly fallen down forty feet upon         
the floor, if by the luckiest chance in the world, I had not been           
stopped by a corking-pin that stuck in the good gentlewoman's               
stomacher; the head of the pin passed between my shirt and the              
waistband of my breeches, and thus I was held by the middle in the air      
till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief.                                        
                                                    {P_2|CH_5 ^paragraph 10}
  Another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my         
trough every third day with fresh water, was so careless to let a huge      
frog (not perceiving it) slip out of his pail. The frog lay                 
concealed till I was put into my boat, but then seeking a resting           
place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one side, that I was         
forced to balance it with all my weight on the other, to prevent            
overturning. When the frog got in, it hopped at once half the length        
of the boat, and then over my head, backwards and forwards, daubing my      
face and clothes with its odious slime. The largeness of its                
features made it appear the most deformed animal that can be                
conceived. However, I desired Glumdaclitch to let me deal with it           
alone. I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and at last          
forced it to leap out of the boat.                                          
  But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom was from         
a monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.                 
Glumdalclitch had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere      
upon business or a visit. The weather being very warm, the closet           
window was left open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger      
box, in which I usually lived, because of its largeness and                 
conveniency. As I sat quietly meditating at my table, I heard               
something bounce in at the closet window, and skip about from one side      
to the other; whereat, although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured          
to look out, but stirred not from my seat; and then I saw this              
frolicsome animal, frisking and leaping up and down, till at last he        
came to my box, which he seemed to view with great pleasure and             
curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window. I retreated to the      
farther corner of my room, or box, but the monkey looking in at             
every side, put me into such a fright, that I wanted presence of            
mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done.          
After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last      
espied me, and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat            
does when she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to         
avoid him, he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made      
of that country cloth, was very thick and strong) and dragged me            
out. He took me up in his right forefoot, and held me as a nurse            
does a child she is going to suckle, just as I have seen the same sort      
of creature do with a kitten in Europe: and when I offered to               
struggle, he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more prudent to         
submit. I have good to believe that he took me for a young one of           
his own species, by his often stroking my face very gently with his         
other paw. In these diversions he was interrupted by a noise at the         
closet door, as if somebody were opening it; whereupon he suddenly          
leaped up to the window at which he had come in, and thence upon the        
leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and holding me in the           
fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to ours. I             
heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me          
out. The poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace        
was all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was          
seen by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building,        
holding me like a baby in one of his fore-paws, and feeding me with         
the other, by cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out      
of the bag on one side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not        
eat; whereat many of the rabble below could not forbear laughing;           
neither do I think they justly ought to be blamed, for without              
question the sight was ridiculous enough to everybody but myself. Some      
of the people threw up stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but         
this was strictly forbidden, or else very probably my brains had            
been dashed out.                                                            
  The ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men, which           
the monkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not           
being able to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on         
a ridge tile, and made his escape. Here I sat for some time three           
hundred yards from the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down      
by the wind, or to fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over         
and over from the ridge to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my          
nurse's footmen, climbed up, and putting me into his breeches               
pocket, brought me down safe.                                               
  I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed          
down my throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth          
with a small needle, and then I fell to vomiting, which gave me             
great relief. Yet I was so weak and bruised in the sides with the           
squeezes given me by this odious animal, that I was forced to keep          
my bed a fortnight. The King, Queen, and all the court, sent every day      
to inquire after my health, and her Majesty made me several visits          
during my sickness. The monkey was killed, and an order made that no        
such animal should be kept about the palace.                                
  When I attended the King after my recovery, to return him thanks for      
his favors, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this                
adventure. He asked me what my thoughts and speculations were while         
I lay in the monkey's paw, how I liked the victuals he gave me, his         
manner of feeding, and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened      
my stomach. He desired to know what I would have done upon such an          
occasion my own country. I told his Majesty that in Europe we had no        
monkeys, except such as were brought for curiosities from other             
places, and so small that I could deal with a dozen of them                 
together, if they presumed to attack me. And as for that monstrous          
animal with whom I was so lately engaged (it was indeed as large as an      
elephant), if my fears had suffered me to think so far as to make           
use of my hanger (looking fiercely and clapping my hand upon the            
hilt as I spoke) when he poked his paw into my chamber, perhaps I           
should have given him such a wound, as would have made him glad to          
withdraw it with more haste than he put it in. This I delivered in a        
firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage should be         
called in question. However, my speech produced nothing else besides a      
loud laughter, which all the respect due to his Majesty from those          
about him could not make them contain. This made me reflect how vain        
an attempt it is for a man to endeavor doing himself honor among those      
who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him. And           
yet I have seen the moral of my own behavior very frequent in               
England since my return, where a little contemptible varlet, without        
the least title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall               
presume to look with importance, and put himself upon a foot with           
the greatest persons of the kingdom.                                        
                                                    {P_2|CH_5 ^paragraph 15}
  I was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story; and      
Glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to      
inform the Queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought           
would be diverting to her Majesty. The girl, who had been out of            
order, was carried by her governess to take the air about an hour's         
distance, or thirty miles from town. They alighted out of the coach         
near a small footpath in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my         
traveling box, I went out of it to walk. There was a cow dung in the        
path, and I must needs try my activity by attempting to leap over           
it. I took a run, but unfortunately jumped short, and found myself          
just in the middle up to my knees. I waded through with some                
difficulty, and one of the footmen wiped me as clean as he could            
with his handkerchief; for I was filthily bemired, and my nurse             
confined me to my box till we returned home; where the Queen was            
soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen spread it about           
the court, so that all the mirth, for some days, was at my expense.         
                                                                            
P_2|CH_6                                                                    
  CHAPTER VI                                                                
-                                                                           
  I used to attend the King's levee once or twice a week, and had           
often seen him under the barber's hand, which indeed was at first very      
terrible to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an            
ordinary scythe. His Majesty, according to the custom of the                
country, was only shaved twice a week. I once prevailed on the              
barber to give me some of the suds or lather, out of which I picked         
forty or fifty of the strongest stumps of hair. I then took a piece of      
fine wood, and cut it like the back of a comb, making several holes in      
it at equal distance with as small a needle as I could get from             
Glumdalclitch. I fixed in the stumps so artificially, scraping and          
sloping them with my knife toward the points, that I made a very            
tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own being so much         
broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither did I know         
any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would undertake to         
make me another.                                                            
  And this puts me in mind of an amusement wherein I spent many of          
my leisure hours. I desired the Queen's woman to save for me the            
combings of her Majesty's hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity,      
and consulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received           
general orders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two         
chair frames, no larger than those I had in my box, and then to bore        
little holes with a fine awl round those parts where I designed the         
backs and seats; through these holes I wove the strongest hairs I           
could pick out, just after the manner of cane chairs in England.            
When they were finished, I made a present of them to her Majesty,           
who kept them in her cabinet, and used to show them for curiosities,        
as indeed they were the wonder of every one that beheld them. The           
Queen would have had me sit upon one of these chairs, but I absolutely      
refused to obey her, protesting I would rather die a thousand deaths        
than place a dishonorable part of my body on those precious hairs that      
once adorned her Majesty's head. Of these hairs (as I had always a          
mechanical genius) I likewise made a neat little purse about five feet      
long, with her Majesty's name deciphered in gold letters, which I gave      
to Glumdalclitch, by the Queen's consent. To say the truth, it was          
more for show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of         
the larger coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little      
toys that girls are fond of.                                                
  The King, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to      
which I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear         
them; but the noise was so great, that I could hardly distinguish           
the tunes. I am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal        
army, beating and sounding together just at your ears, could not equal      
it. My practice was to have my box removed from the places where the        
performers sat, as far as I could, then to shut the doors and               
windows of it, and draw the window curtains; after which I found their      
music not disagreeable.                                                     
  I had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet                
Glumdaclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a         
week to teach her: I call it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled        
that instrument. and was played upon in the same manner. A fancy            
came into my head that I would entertain the King and Queen with an         
English tune upon this instrument. But this appeared extremely              
difficult; for the spinet was near sixty feet long, each key being          
almost a foot wide, so that, with my arms extended, I could not             
reach to above five keys, and to press them down required a good smart      
stroke with my fist, which would be too great a labor, and to no            
purpose. The method I contrived was this. I prepared two round              
sticks about the bigness of common cudgels; they were thicker at one        
end than the other, and I covered the thicker ends with a piece of a        
mouse's skin, that by rapping on them I might neither damage the            
tops of the keys, nor interrupt the sound. Before the spinet a bench        
was placed, about four feet below the keys, and I was put upon the          
bench. I ran sideling upon it that way and this, as fast as I could,        
banging the proper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a      
jig, to the great satisfaction of both their Majesties: but it was the      
most violent exercise I ever underwent, and yet I could not strike          
above sixteen keys, nor, consequently, play the bass and treble             
together, as other artists do; which was a great disadvantage to my         
performance.                                                                
  The King, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent            
understanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my        
box, and set upon the table in his closet. He would then command me to      
bring one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards      
distance upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a          
level with his face. In this manner I had several conversations with        
him. I one day took the freedom to tell his Majesty, that the contempt      
he discovered towards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not            
seem answerable to those excellent qualities of the mind he was master      
of. That reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the body: on         
the contrary, we observed in our country that the tallest persons were      
usually least provided with it. That among other animals, bees and          
ants had the reputation of more industry, art and sagacity, than            
many of the larger kinds. And that, as inconsiderable as he took me to      
be, I hoped I might live to do his Majesty some signal service. The         
King heard me with attention, and began to conceive a much better           
opinion of me than he had ever before. He desired I would give him          
as exact an account of the government of England as I possibly              
could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of their own customs        
(for so he conjectured of other monarchs, by my former discourses), he      
should be glad to hear of anything that might deserve imitation.            
                                                     {P_2|CH_6 ^paragraph 5}
  Imagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished           
for the tongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to      
celebrate the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to      
its merits and felicity.                                                    
  I began my discourse by informing his Majesty that our dominions          
consisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms under        
one sovereign, beside our plantations in America. I dwelt long upon         
the fertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate. I            
then spoke at large upon the constitution of an English Parliament,         
partly made up of an illustrious body called the House of Peers,            
persons of the noblest blood, and of the most ancient and ample             
patrimonies. I described that extraordinary care always taken of their      
education in arts and arms, to qualify them for being counselors            
born to the king and kingdom, to have a share in the legislature, to        
be members of the highest Court of Judicature, from whence there could      
be no appeal, and to be champions always ready for the defense of           
their prince and country, by their valor, conduct, and fidelity.            
That these were the ornament and bulwark of the kingdom, worthy             
followers of their most renowned ancestors, whose honor had been the        
reward of their virtue, from which their posterity were never once          
known to degenerate. To these we joined several holy persons, as            
part of that assembly, under the title of Bishops, whose peculiar           
business it is to take care of religion, and of those who instruct the      
people therein. These were searched and sought out through the whole        
nation, by the prince and his wisest counselors, among such of the          
priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of         
their lives, and the depth of their erudition; who were indeed the          
spiritual fathers of the clergy and the people.                             
  That the other part of the Parliament consisted of an assembly            
called the House of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen,              
freely picked and culled out by the people themselves, for their great      
abilities and love of their country, to represent the wisdom of the         
whole nation. And these two bodies make up the most august assembly in      
Europe, to whom, in conjunction with the prince, the whole legislature      
is committed.                                                               
  I then descended to the Courts of justice, over which the judges,         
those venerable sages and interpreters of the law, presided, for            
determining the disputed rights and properties of men, as well as           
for the punishment of vice, and protection of innocence. I mentioned        
the prudent management of our treasury; the valor and achievements          
of our forces by sea and land. I computed the number of our people, by      
reckoning how many millions there might be of each religious sect,          
or political party among us. I did not omit even our sports and             
pastimes, or any other particular which I thought might redound to the      
honor of my country. And I finished all with a brief historical             
account of affairs and events in England for about a hundred years          
past.                                                                       
  This conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of             
several hours, and the King heard the whole with great attention,           
frequently taking notes of what I spoke, as well as memorandums of          
several questions he intended to ask me.                                    
                                                    {P_2|CH_6 ^paragraph 10}
  When I had put an end to these long discourses, his Majesty in a          
sixth audience, consulting his notes, proposed many doubts, queries,        
and objections, upon every article. He asked what methods were used to      
cultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility, and in what kind      
of business they commonly spent the first and teachable part of             
their lives. What course was taken to supply that assembly when any         
noble family became extinct. What qualifications were in those who          
were to be created new lords. Whether the humor of the prince, a sum        
of money to a court lady, or a prime minister, or a design of               
strengthening a party opposite to the public interest, ever happened        
to be motives in those advancements. What share of knowledge these          
lords had in the laws of their country, and how they came by it, so as      
to enable them to decide the properties of their fellow-subjects in         
the last resort. Whether they were always so free from avarice,             
partialities, or want, that a bribe, or some other sinister view,           
could have no place among them. Whether those holy lords I spoke of         
were always promoted to that rank upon account of their knowledge in        
religious matters, and the sanctity of their lives, had never been          
compliers with the times while they were common priests, or slavish         
prostitute chaplains to some nobleman, whose opinions they continued        
servilely to follow after they were admitted into that assembly.            
  He then desired to know what arts were practiced in electing those        
whom I commoners: whether a stranger with a strong purse might not          
influence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord,        
or the most considerable gentleman in the neighborhood. How it came to      
pass, that people were so violently bent upon getting into this             
assembly, which I allowed to be a great trouble and expense, often          
to the ruin of their families, without any salary or pension:               
because this appeared such an exalted strain of virtue and public           
spirit, that his Majesty seemed to doubt it might possibly not be           
always sincere: and he desired to know whether such zealous                 
gentlemen could have any views of refunding themselves for the charges      
and trouble they were at, by sacrificing the public good to the             
designs of a weak and vicious prince in conjunction with a corrupted        
ministry. He multiplied his questions and sifted me thoroughly upon         
every part of this head, proposing numberless inquiries and                 
objections, which I think it not prudent or convenient to repeat.           
  Upon what I said in relation to our Courts of Justice, his Majesty        
desired to be satisfied in several points: and this I was the better        
able to do, having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in            
chancery, which was decreed for me with costs. He asked, what time was      
usually spent in determining between right and wrong, and what              
degree of expense. Whether advocates and orators had liberty to             
plead in causes manifestly known to be unjust, vexatious, or                
oppressive. Whether party in religion or politics were observed to          
be of any weight in the scale of justice. Whether those pleading            
orators were persons educated in the general knowledge of equity, or        
only in provincial, national, and other local customs. Whether they or      
their judges had any part in penning those laws which they assumed the      
liberty of interpreting and glossing upon at their pleasure. Whether        
they had ever at different times pleaded for and against the same           
cause, and cited precedents to prove contrary opinions. Whether they        
were a rich or a poor corporation. Whether they received any pecuniary      
reward for pleading or delivering their opinions. And particularly          
whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower senate.             
  He fell next upon the management of our treasury; and said he             
thought my memory had failed me, because I computed our taxes at about      
five or six millions a year, and when I came to mention the issues, he      
found they sometimes amounted to more than double; for the notes he         
had taken were very particular in this point, because he hoped, as          
he told me, that the knowledge of our conduct might be useful to            
him, and he could not be deceived in his calculations. But, if what         
I told him were true, he was still at a loss how a kingdom could run        
out of its estate like a private person. He asked me, who were our          
creditors; and where we should find money to pay them. He wondered          
to hear me talk of such chargeable and extensive wars; that                 
certainly we must be a quarrelsome people, or live among very bad           
neighbors, and that our generals must needs be richer than our              
kings. He asked what business we had out of our own islands, unless         
upon the score of trade or treaty, or to defend the coasts with our         
fleet. About all, he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary              
standing army in the midst of peace, and among a free people. He said,      
if we were governed by our own consent in the persons of our                
representatives, he could not imagine of whom we were afraid, or            
against whom we were to fight; and would hear my opinion, whether a         
private man's house might not better be defended by himself, his            
children, and family, than by half a dozen rascals picked up at a           
venture in the streets, for small wages, who might get a hundred times      
more by cutting their throats.                                              
  He laughed at my odd kind of arithmetic (as he was pleased to call        
it) in reckoning the numbers of our people by a computation drawn from      
the several sects among us in religion and politics. He said, he            
knew no reason, why those who entertain opinions prejudicial to the         
public, should be obliged to change, or should not be obliged to            
conceal them. And as it was tyranny in any government to require the        
first, so it was weakness not to enforce the second: for a man may          
be allowed to keep poisons in his closet, but not to vend them about        
for cordials.                                                               
                                                    {P_2|CH_6 ^paragraph 15}
  He observed that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry I        
had mentioned gaming. He desired to know at what age this                   
entertainment was usually taken up, and when it was laid down; how          
much of their time it employed; whether it ever went so high as to          
affect their fortunes; whether mean vicious people, by their dexterity      
in that art, might not arrive at great riches, and sometimes keep           
our very nobles in dependence, as well as habituate them to vile            
companions, wholly take them from the improvement of their minds,           
and force them, by the losses they have received, to learn and              
practice that infamous dexterity upon others.                               
  He was perfectly astonished with the historical account I gave him        
of our affairs during the last century, protesting it was only a            
heap of conspiracies, rebellions, murders, massacres, revolutions,          
banishments, the very worst effects that avarice, faction,                  
hypocrisy, perfidiousness, cruelty, rage, madness, hatred, envy, lust,      
malice, or ambition could produce.                                          
  His Majesty in another audience was at the pains to recapitulate the      
sum of all I had spoken, compared the questions he made with the            
answers I had given, then taking me into his hands, and stroking me         
gently, delivered himself in these words, which I shall never forget        
nor the manner he spoke them in: My little friend Grildrig, you have        
made a most admirable panegyric upon your country; you have clearly         
proved that ignorance, idleness, and vice, may be sometimes the only        
ingredients for qualifying a legislator; that laws are best explained,      
interpreted, and applied by those whose interest and abilities lie          
in perverting, confounding, and eluding them. I observe among you some      
lines of an institution, which in its original might have been              
tolerable, but these half erased, and the rest wholly blurred and           
blotted by corruptions. It does not appear from all you have said, how      
any one virtue is required towards the procurement of any one               
station among you; much less that men are ennobled on account of their      
virtue, that priests are advanced for their piety or learning,              
soldiers for their conduct or valor, judges for their integrity,            
senators for the love of their country, or counsellors for their            
wisdom. As for yourself (continued the King) who have spent the             
greatest part of your life in traveling, I am well disposed to hope         
you may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country. But by            
what I have gathered from your own relation, and the answers I have         
with much pains wringed and extorted from you, I cannot but conclude        
the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little           
odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of        
the earth.                                                                  
                                                                            
P_2|CH_7                                                                    
  CHAPTER VII                                                               
-                                                                           
  Nothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from          
concealing this part of my story. It was in vain to discover my             
resentments, which were always turned into ridicule; and I was              
forced to rest with patience while my noble and most beloved country        
was so injuriously treated. I am heartily sorry as any of my readers        
can possibly be, that such an occasion was given: but this prince           
happened to be so curious and inquisitive upon every particular,            
that it could not consist either with gratitude or good manners to          
refuse giving him what satisfaction I was able. Yet thus much I may be      
allowed to say in my own vindication, that I artfully eluded many of        
his questions, and gave to every point a more favorable turn by many        
degrees than the strictness of truth would allow. For I have always         
borne that laudable partiality to my own country, which Dionysius           
Halicarnassensis with so much justice recommends to a historian. I          
would hide the frailties and deformities of my political mother, and        
place her virtues and beauties in the most advantageous light. This         
was my sincere endeavor in those many discourses I had with that            
mighty monarch, although it unfortunately failed of success.                
  But great allowances should be given to a King who lives wholly           
secluded from the rest of the world, and must therefore be                  
altogether unacquainted with the manners and customs that most prevail      
in other nations; the want of which knowledge will ever produce many        
prejudices, and a certain narrowness of thinking, from which we and         
the politer countries of Europe are wholly exempted. And it would be        
hard indeed, if so remote a prince's notions of virtue and vice were        
to be offered as a standard for all mankind.                                
  To confirm what I have now said, and further, to show the                 
miserable effects of a confined education, I shall here insert a            
passage which will hardly obtain belief. In hopes to ingratiate myself      
farther into his Majesty's favor, I told him of an invention                
discovered between three and four hundred years ago, to make a certain      
powder, into a heap of which the smallest spark of fire falling, would      
kindle the whole in a moment, although it were as big as a mountain,        
and make it all fly up in the air together, with a noise and agitation      
greater than thunder. That a proper quantity of this powder rammed          
into a hollow tube of brass or iron, according to its bigness, would        
drive a ball of iron or lead with such violence and speed, as               
nothing was able to sustain its force. the largest balls thus               
discharged, would not only destroy whole ranks of an army at once, but      
batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink down ships, with a           
thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea; and, when linked            
together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide            
hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them.            
That we often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and          
discharged them by an engine into some city we were besieging, which        
would rip up the pavements, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw      
splinters on every side, dashing out the brains of all who came             
near. That I knew the ingredients very well, which were cheap, and          
common; I understood the manner of compounding them, and could              
direct his workmen how to make those tubes of a size proportionable to      
all other things in his Majesty's kingdom, and the largest need not be      
above a hundred feet long; twenty or thirty of which tubes, charged         
with the proper quantity of powder and balls, would batter down the         
walls of the strongest town in his dominions in a few hours, or             
destroy the whole metropolis, if ever it should pretend to dispute his      
absolute commands. This I humbly offered to his Majesty, as a small         
tribute of acknowledgment in return of so many marks that I had             
received of his royal favor and protection.                                 
  The King was struck with horror at the description I had given of         
those terrible engines, and the proposal I had made. He was amazed how      
so impotent and grovelling an insect as I (these were his expressions)      
could entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner as          
to appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation,         
which I had painted as the common effects of those destructive              
machines, whereof he said some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must          
have been the first contriver. As for himself, he protested that            
although few things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or      
in nature, yet he would rather lose half his kingdom than be privy          
to such a secret, which he commanded me, as I valued my life, never to      
mention any more.                                                           
  A strange effect of narrow principles and short views that a              
prince possessed of every quality which procures veneration, love, and      
esteem; of strong parts, great wisdom, and profound learning, endued        
with admirable talents for government, and almost adored by his             
subjects, should from a nice unnecessary scruple, whereof in Europe we      
can have no conception, let slip an opportunity to put into his hands,      
that would have made him absolute master of the lives, the                  
liberties, and the fortunes of his people. Neither do I say this            
with the least intention to detract from the many virtues of that           
excellent King, whose character I am sensible will on this account          
be very much lessened in the opinion of an English reader: but I            
take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance, they        
not having hitherto reduced politics into a science, as the more acute      
wits of Europe have done. For I remember very well, in a discourse one      
day with the King, when I happened to say there were several                
thousand books among us written upon the art of government, it gave         
him (directly contrary to my intention) a very mean opinion of our          
understandings. He professed both to abominate and despise all              
mystery, refinement, and intrigue, either in a prince or a minister.        
He could not tell what I meant secrets of state, where an enemy or          
some rival nation were not in the case. He confined the knowledge of        
governing within very narrow bounds; to common sense and reason, to         
justice and lenity, to the speedy determination of civil and                
criminal causes; with some other obvious topics, which are not worth        
considering. And he gave it for his opinion, that whoever could make        
two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of              
ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind,         
and do more essential service to his country than the whole race of         
politicians put together.                                                   
                                                     {P_2|CH_7 ^paragraph 5}
  The learning of this people is very defective, consisting only in         
morality, history, poetry, and mathematics, wherein they must be            
allowed to excel. But the last of these is wholly applied to what           
may be useful in life, to the improvement of agriculture, and all           
mechanical arts; so that among us it would be little esteemed. And          
as to ideas, entities, abstractions, and transcendentals, I could           
never drive the least conception into their heads.                          
  No law of that country must exceed in words the number of letters in      
their alphabet, which consists only of twenty-two. But indeed few of        
them extend even to that length. They are expressed in the most             
plain and simple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial              
enough to discover above one interpretation; and to write a comment         
upon any law is a capital crime. As to the decision of civil causes,        
or proceedings against criminals, their precedents are so few, that         
they have little reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either.      
  They have had the art of printing, as well as the Chinese, time           
out of mind. But their libraries are not very large; for that of the        
King's which is reckoned the biggest, does not amount to above a            
thousand volumes, placed in a gallery twelve hundred feet long, from        
which I had liberty to borrow what books I pleased. The Queen's joiner      
had contrived in one of Glumdalclitch's rooms a kind of wooden machine      
twenty-five feet high, formed like a standing ladder; the steps were        
each fifty feet long. It was indeed a moveable pair of stairs, the          
lowest end placed at ten feet distance from the wall of the chamber.        
The book I had a mind to read was put up leaning against the wall. I        
first mounted to the upper step of the ladder, and turning my face          
towards the book, began at the top of the page, and so walking to           
the right and left about eight or ten yards, according to the length        
of the lines, till I had gotten a little below the level of my eyes,        
and then descending gradually till I came to the bottom; after which I      
mounted again and began the other page in the same manner, and so           
turned over the leaf, which I could easily do with both my hands,           
for it was as thick and stiff as pasteboard, and in the largest folios      
not above eighteen or twenty feet long.                                     
  Their style is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid, for          
they avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words, or using        
various expressions. I have perused many of their books, especially         
those in history and morality. Among the rest, I was much diverted          
with a little old treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch's bed         
chamber, and belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman,        
who dealt in writings of morality and devotion. The book treats of the      
weakness of human kind, and is in little esteem, except among the           
women and the vulgar. However, I was curious to see what an author          
of that country could say upon such a subject. This writer went             
through all the usual topics of European showing how diminutive,            
contemptible, and helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how         
unable to defend himself from the inclemencies of the air, or the fury      
of wild beasts; how much he was excelled by one creature in                 
strength, by another in speed, by a third in foresight, by a fourth in      
industry. He added, that nature was degenerated in these latter             
declining ages of the world, and could now produce only small abortive      
births in comparison of those in ancient times. He said, it was very        
reasonable to think, not only that the species of men were                  
originally much larger, but also, that there must have been giants          
in former ages, which, as it is asserted by history and tradition,          
so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls casually dug up in        
several parts of the Kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled race        
of man in our days. He argued, that the very laws of nature absolutely      
required we should have been made in the beginning, of a size more          
large and robust, not so liable to destruction from every little            
accident of a tile falling from a house, or a stone cast from the hand      
of a boy, or of being drowned in a little brook. From this way of           
reasoning the author drew several moral applications useful in the          
conduct of life, but needless here to repeat. For my own part, I could      
not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread, of             
drawing lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent         
and repining, from the quarrels we raise with nature. And I believe,        
upon a strict inquiry, those quarrels might be shown as ill-grounded        
among us as they are among that people.                                     
  As to their military affairs, they boast that the King's army             
consists of a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two         
thousand horse: if that may be called an army which is made up of           
tradesmen in the several cities, and farmers in the country, whose          
commanders are only the nobility and gentry, without pay or reward.         
They are indeed perfect enough in their exercises, and under very good      
discipline, wherein I saw no great merit; for how should it be              
otherwise, where every farmer is under the command of his own               
landlord, and every citizen under that of the principal men in his own      
city, chosen after the manner of Venice by ballot?                          
                                                    {P_2|CH_7 ^paragraph 10}
  I have often seen the militia of Lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise        
in a great field near the city of twenty miles square. They were in         
all not above twenty-five thousand foot, and six thousand horse; but        
it was impossible for me to compute their number, considering the           
space of ground they took up. A cavalier mounted on a large steed,          
might be about a hundred feet high. I have seen this whole body of          
horse, upon a word of command, draw their swords at once, and brandish      
them in the air. Imagination can figure nothing so grand, so                
surprising, and so astonishing. It looked as if ten thousand flashes        
of lightning were darting at the same time from every quarter of the        
sky.                                                                        
  I was curious to know how this prince, to whose dominions there is        
no access from any other country, came to think of armies, or to teach      
his people the practice of military discipline. But I was soon              
informed, both by conversation and reading their histories. For in the      
course of many ages they have been troubled with the same disease to        
which the whole race of mankind is subject; the nobility often              
contending for power, the people for liberty, and the King for              
absolute dominion. All which, however happily tempered by the laws          
of the kingdom, have been sometimes violated by each of the three           
parties, and have once or more occasioned civil wars, the last whereof      
was happily put an end to by this prince's grandfather by a general         
composition; and the militia, then settled with common consent, has         
been ever since kept in the strictest duty.                                 
                                                                            
P_2|CH_8                                                                    
  CHAPTER VIII                                                              
-                                                                           
  I had always a strong impulse that I should some time recover my          
liberty, though it was impossible to conjecture by what means, or to        
form any project with the least hope of succeeding. The ship in             
which I sailed was the first ever known to be driven within sight of        
that coast, and the King had given strict orders, that if at any            
time another appeared, it should be taken ashore, and with all its          
crew and passengers brought in a tumbril to Lorbrulgrud. He was             
strongly bent to get me a woman of my own size, by whom I might             
propagate the breed: but I think I should rather have died than             
undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be kept in cages like      
tame canary birds, and perhaps, in time, sold about the kingdom to          
persons of quality for curiosities. I was, indeed, treated with much        
kindness; I was the favorite of a great King and Queen, and the             
delight of the whole court, but it was upon such a foot as ill              
became the dignity of human kind. I could never forget those                
domestic pledges I had left behind me. I wanted to be among people          
with whom I could converse upon even terms, and walk about the streets      
and fields without fear of being trod to death like a frog or a             
young puppy. But my deliverance came sooner than I expected, and in         
a manner not very common; the whole story and circumstances of which I      
shall faithfully relate.                                                    
  I had now been two years in this country; and about the beginning of      
the third, Glumdalclitch and I attended the King and Queen in a             
progress to the coast of the kingdom. I was carried, as usual, in my        
traveling box, which, as I have already described, was a very               
convenient closet of twelve feet wide. And I had ordered a hammock          
to be fixed by silken ropes from the four corners at the top, to break      
the jolts, when a servant carried me before him on horseback, as I          
sometimes desired, and would often sleep in my hammock while we were        
upon the road. On the roof of my closet, just over the middle of the        
hammock, I ordered the joiner to cut out a hole a foot square, to give      
me air in hot weather as I slept, which hole I shut at pleasure with a      
board that drew backwards and forwards through a groove.                    
  When we came to our journey's end, the King thought proper to pass a      
few days at a palace he has near Flanflasnic, a city within eighteen        
English miles of the seaside. Glumdalclitch and I were much                 
fatigued; I had gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as        
to be confined to her chamber. I longed to see the ocean, which must        
be the only scene of my escape, if ever it should happen. I                 
pretended to be worse than I really was, and desired leave to take the      
fresh air of the sea, with a page whom I was very fond of, and who had      
sometimes been trusted with me. I shall never forget with what              
unwillingness Glumdalclitch consented, nor the strict charge she            
gave the page to be careful of me, bursting at the same time into a         
flood of tears, as if she had some foreboding of what was to happen.        
The boy took me out in my box about half an hour's walk from the            
palace, towards the rocks on the seashore. I ordered him to set me          
down, and lifting up one of my sashes, cast many a wistful                  
melancholy look towards the sea. I found myself not very well, and          
told the page that I had a mind to take a nap in my hammock, which I        
hoped would do me good. I got in, and the boy shut the window close         
down to keep out the cold. I soon fell asleep, and all I can                
conjecture is, that while I slept, the page, thinking no danger             
could happen, went among the rocks to look for birds' eggs, having          
before observed him from my window searching about, and picking up one      
or two in the clefts. Be that as it will, I found myself suddenly           
awaked with a violent pull upon the ring which was fastened at the top      
of my box for the conveniency of carriage. I felt my box raised very        
high in the air, and then borne forward with prodigious speed. The          
first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock, but                
afterwards the motion was easy enough. I called out several times as        
loud as I could raise my voice, but all to no purpose. I looked             
towards my windows and could see nothing but the clouds and sky. I          
heard a noise just over my head like the clapping of wings, and then        
began to perceive the woeful condition I was in; that some eagle had        
got the ring of my box in his beak, with an intent to let it fall on a      
rock like a tortoise in a shell, and then pick out my body, and devour      
it. For the sagacity and smell of this bird enable him to discover his      
quarry at a great distance, though better concealed than I could be         
within a two-inch board.                                                    
  In a little time I observed the noise of flutter of wings to              
increase very fast, and my box was tossed up and down, like a sign          
post on a windy day. I heard several bangs or buffets, as I thought,        
given to the eagle (for such I am certain it must have been that            
held the ring of my box in his beak), and then all of a sudden felt         
myself falling perpendicularly down for above a minute, but with            
such incredible swiftness that I almost lost my breath. My fall was         
stopped by a terrible squash, that sounded louder to my ears than           
the cataract of Niagara; after which I was quite in the dark for            
another minute, and then my box began to rise so high that I could see      
light from the tops of my windows. I now perceived that I had fallen        
into the sea. My box, by the weight of my body, the goods that were         
in, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength at the four             
corners of the top and bottom, floated five feet deep in water. I           
did then, and do now, suppose that the eagle which flew away with my        
box was pursued by two or three others, and forced to let me drop           
while he was defending himself against the rest, who hoped to share in      
the prey. The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for         
those were the strongest) preserved the balance while it fell, and          
hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water. Every joint      
of it was well grooved, and the door did not move on hinges, but up         
and down like a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little        
water came in. I got with much difficulty out of my hammock, having         
first ventured to draw back the slipboard on the roof already               
mentioned, contrived on purpose to let in air, for want of which I          
found myself almost stifled.                                                
  How often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from         
whom one single hour had so far divided me! And I may say with              
truth, that in the midst of my own misfortunes I could not forbear          
lamenting my poor nurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the        
displeasure of the Queen, and the ruin of her fortune. Perhaps many         
travelers have not been under greater difficulties and distress than I      
was at this juncture, expecting every moment to see my box dashed in        
pieces, or at least overset by the first violent blast, or a rising         
wave. A breach in one single pane of glass would have been immediate        
death: nor could anything have preserved the windows, but the strong        
lattice wires placed on the outside against accidents in traveling.         
I saw the water ooze in at several crannies, although the leaks were        
not considerable, and I endeavored to stop them as well as I could.         
I was not able to lift up the roof of my closet, which otherwise I          
certainly should have done, and sat on the top of it, where I might at      
least preserve myself some hours longer than by being shut up, as I         
may call it, in the hold. Or, if I escaped these dangers for a day          
or two, what could I expect but a miserable death of cold and               
hunger! I was four hours under these circumstances, expecting and           
indeed wishing every moment to be my last.                                  
                                                     {P_2|CH_8 ^paragraph 5}
  I have already told the reader that there were two strong staples         
fixed upon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the      
servant who used to carry me on horseback would put a leathern belt,        
and buckle it about his waist. Being in this disconsolate state, I          
heard or at least thought I beard some kind of grating noise on that        
side of my box where the staples were fixed, and soon after I began to      
fancy that the box was pulled or towed along in the sea; for I now and      
then felt a sort of tugging, which made the waves rise near the tops        
of my windows, leaving me almost in the dark. This gave me some             
faint hopes of relief, although I was not able to imagine how it could      
be brought about. I ventured to unscrew one of my chairs, which were        
always fastened to the floor; and having made a hard shift to screw it      
down again directly under the slipping-board that I had lately opened,      
I mounted on the chair, and putting my mouth as near as I could to the      
hole, I called for help in a loud voice, and in all the languages I         
understood. I then fastened my handkerchief to a stick I usually            
carried, and thrusting it up the hole, waved it several times in the        
air, that if any boat or ship were near, the seamen might conjecture        
some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.                               
  I found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my           
closet to be moved along; and in the space of an hour, or better, that      
side of the box where the staples were, and had no window, struck           
against something that was hard. I apprehended it to be a rock, and         
found myself tossed more than ever. I plainly heard a noise upon the        
cover of my closet, like that of a cable, and the grating of it as          
it passed through the ring. I then found myself hoisted up by               
degrees at least three feet higher than I was before. Whereupon I           
again thrust up my stick and handkerchief, calling for help till I was      
almost hoarse. In return to which, I heard a great shout repeated           
three times, giving me such transports of joy, as are not to be             
conceived but by those who feel them. I now heard a trampling over          
my head, and somebody calling through the hole with a loud voice in         
the English tongue: If there be anybody below, let them speak. I            
answered, I was an Englishman, drawn by ill fortune into the                
greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent, and begged, by all      
that is moving, to be delivered out of the dungeon I was in. The voice      
replied, I was safe, for my box was fastened to their ship; and the         
carpenter should immediately come and saw an hole in the cover,             
large enough to pull me out. I answered, that was needless, and             
would take up too much time, for there was no more to be done, but let      
one of the crew put his finger into the ring, and take the box out          
of the sea into the ship, and so into the captain's cabin. Some of          
them upon hearing me talk so wildly thought I was mad; others laughed;      
for indeed it never came into my head that I was now among people of        
my own stature and strength. The carpenter came, and in a few               
minutes sawed a passage about four feet square, then let down a             
small ladder, upon which I mounted, and from thence was taken into the      
ship in a very weak condition.                                              
  The sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand                
questions, which I had no inclination to answer. I was equally              
confounded at the sight of so many pigmies, for such I took them to         
be, after having so long accustomed my eyes to the monstrous objects I      
had left. But the Captain, Mr. Thomas Wilcocks, an honest worthy            
Shropshire man, observing I was ready to faint, took me into his            
cabin, gave me a cordial to comfort me, and made me turn in upon his        
own bed, advising me to take a little rest, of which I had great need.      
Before I went to sleep I gave him to understand that I had some             
valuable furniture in my box, too good to be lost, a fine hammock, a        
handsome field bed, two chairs, a table, and a cabinet; that my closet      
was hung on all sides, or rather quilted, with silk and cotton; that        
if he would let one of the crew bring my closet into his cabin, I           
would open it there before him, and show him my goods. The Captain          
hearing me utter these absurdities, concluded I was raving: however (I      
suppose to pacify me), he promised to give order as I desired, and          
going upon deck sent some of his men down into my closet, from              
whence (as I afterwards found) they drew up all my goods, and stripped      
off the quilting; but the chairs, cabinet, and bedstead, being screwed      
to the floor, were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen, who         
tore them up by force. Then they knocked off some of the boards for         
the use of the ship, and when they had got all they had a mind for,         
let the hull drop into the sea, which by reason of many breaches            
made in the bottom and sides, sunk to rights. And indeed I was glad         
not to have been a spectator of the havoc they made; because I am           
confident it would have sensibly touched me, by bringing former             
passages into my mind, which I had rather forget.                           
  I slept some hours, but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the          
place I had left, and the dangers I had escaped. However, upon              
waking I found myself much recovered. It was now about eight o'clock        
at night, and the Captain ordered supper immediately, thinking I had        
already fasted too long. He entertained me with great kindness,             
observing me not to look wildly, or talk inconsistently: and when we        
were left alone, desired I would give him a relation of my travels,         
and by what accident I came to be set adrift in that monstrous              
wooden chest. He said, that about twelve o'clock at noon, as he was         
looking through his glass, he spied it at a distance, and thought it        
was a sail, which he had a mind to make, being not much out of his          
course, in hopes of buying some biscuit, his own beginning to fall          
short. That upon coming nearer, and finding his error, he sent out his      
longboat to discover what I was; that his men came back in a fright,        
swearing they had seen a swimming house. That he laughed at their           
folly, and went himself in the boat, ordering his men to take a strong      
cable along with them. That the weather being calm, he rowed round          
me several times, observed my windows, and the wire lattices that           
defended them. That he discovered two staples upon one side, which was      
all of boards, without any passage for light. He then commanded his         
men to row up to that side, and fastening a cable to one of the             
staples, ordered them to tow my chest (as he called it) towards the         
ship. When it was there, he gave directions to fasten another cable to      
the ring fixed in the cover, and to raise up my chest with pulley,          
which all the sailors were not able to do above two or three feet.          
He said they saw my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the hole, and      
concluded that some unhappy men must be shut up in the cavity. I asked      
whether he or the crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air             
about the time he first discovered me. To which he answered, that           
discoursing this matter with the sailors while I was asleep, one of         
them said he had observed three eagles flying towards the north, but        
remarked nothing of their being larger than the usual size, which I         
suppose must be imputed to the great height they were at; and he could      
not guess the reason of my question. I then asked the Captain how           
far he reckoned we might be from land; he said, by the best                 
computation he could make, we were at least a hundred leagues. I            
assured him, that he must be mistaken by almost half, for I had not         
left the country from where I came above two hours before I dropped         
into the sea. Whereupon he began again to think that my brain was           
disturbed, of which he gave me a hint, and advised me to go to bed          
in a cabin he had provided. I assured him I was well refreshed with         
his good entertainment and company, and as much in my senses as ever I      
was in my life. He then grew serious, and desired to ask me freely          
whether I were not troubled in mind by the consciousness of some            
enormous crime, for which I was punished at the command of some             
prince, by exposing me in that chest, as great criminals in other           
countries have been forced to sea in a leaky vessel without                 
provisions; for although he should be sorry to have taken so ill a man      
into his ship, yet he would engage his word to set me safe on shore in      
the first port where we arrived. He added, that his suspicions were         
much increased by some very absurd speeches I had delivered at first        
to the sailors, and afterwards to himself, in relation to my closet or      
chest, as well as by my odd looks and behavior while I was at supper.       
  I begged his patience to hear me tell my story, which I faithfully        
did from the last time I left England to the moment he first                
discovered me. And as truth always forces its way into rational minds,      
so this honest worthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning,         
and very good sense, was immediately convinced of my candor and             
veracity. But further to confirm all I had said, I entreated him to         
give order that my cabinet should be brought, of which I had the key        
in my pocket (for he had already informed me how the seamen disposed        
of my closet), I opened it in his presence and showed him the small         
collection of rarities I made in the country from where I had been          
so strangely delivered. There was a comb I had contrived out of the         
stumps of the King's beard, and another of the same materials, but          
fixed into a paring of her Majesty's thumb-nail, which served for           
the back. There was a collection of needles and pins from a foot to         
half a yard long; four wasp-stings, like joiners' tacks; some combings      
of the Queen's hair; a gold ring which one day she made me a present        
of in a most obliging manner, taking it from her little finger, and         
throwing it over my head like a collar. I desired the Captain would         
please to accept this ring in return of his civilities, which he            
absolutely refused. I showed him a corn that I had cut off with my own      
hand, from a maid of honor's toe; it was about the bigness of a             
Kentish pippin, and grown so hard that when I returned to England, I        
got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver. Lastly, I desired him        
to see the breeches I had then on, which were made of a mouse's skin.       
                                                    {P_2|CH_8 ^paragraph 10}
  I could force nothing on him but a footman's tooth, which I observed      
him to examine with great curiosity, and found he had a fancy for           
it. He received it with abundance of thanks, more than such a trifle        
could deserve. It was drawn by an unskillful surgeon, in a mistake,         
from one of Glumdalclitch's men, who was afflicted with the toothache,      
but it was as sound as any in his head. I got it cleaned, and put it        
into my cabinet. It was about a foot long, and four inches in               
diameter.                                                                   
  The Captain was very well satisfied with plain relation I had             
given him, and said he hoped when we returned to England I would            
oblige the world by putting it in paper and making it public. My            
answer was that I thought we were already overstocked with books of         
travels; that nothing could now pass which was not extraordinary;           
wherein I doubted some authors less consulted truth than their own          
vanity, or interest, or the diversion of ignorant readers. That my          
story could contain little besides common events, without those             
ornamental descriptions of strange plants, trees, birds, and other          
animals, or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of savage people,         
with which most writers abound. However, I thanked him for his good         
opinion, and promised to take the matter into my thoughts.                  
  He said he wondered at one thing very much, which was, to bear me         
speak so loud, asking me whether the King or Queen of that country          
were thick of hearing. I told him it was what I had been used to for        
above two years past, and that I admired as much at the voices of           
him and his men, who seemed to me only to whisper, and yet I could          
hear them well enough. But when I spoke in that country, it was like a      
man talking in the street to another looking out from the top of a          
steeple, unless when I was placed on a table, or held in any                
person's hand, I told him, I had likewise observed another thing, that      
when I first got into the ship, and the sailors stood all about me,         
I thought they were the most little contemptible creatures I had            
ever beheld. For indeed while I was in that prince's country, I             
could never endure to look in a glass after my eyes had been                
accustomed to such prodigious objects, because the comparison gave          
me so despicable a conceit of myself. The Captain said that while we        
were at supper he observed me look at everything with a sort of             
wonder, and that I often seemed hardly able to contain my laughter,         
which he knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some disorder in      
my brain. I answered, it was very true; and I wondered how I could          
forbear, when I saw his dishes of the size of a silver three-pence,         
a leg of pork hardly a mouthful, a cup not so big as a nut-shell;           
and so I went on, describing the rest of his household stuff and            
provisions after the same manner. For, although the Queen had               
ordered a little equipage of all things necessary for me while I was        
in her service, yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on        
every side of me, and I winked at my own littleness as people do at         
their own faults. The Captain understood my raillery very well, and         
merrily replied with the old English proverb, that he doubted my            
eyes were bigger than my belly, for he did not observe my stomach so        
good, although I had fasted all day; and continuing in his mirth,           
protested he would have gladly given a hundred pounds to have seen          
my closet in the eagle's bill, and afterwards in its fall from so           
great a height into the sea; which would certainly have been a most         
astonishing object, worthy to have the description of it transmitted        
to future ages: and the comparison of Phaeton was so obvious, that          
he could not forbear applying it, although I did not much admire the        
conceit.                                                                    
  The Captain having been at Tonquin, was in his return to England          
driven northeastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and of longitude        
143. But meeting a trade wind two days after I came on board him, we        
sailed southward a long time, and coasting New Holland kept our course      
west-southwest, and then south-southwest till we doubled the Cape of        
Good Hope. Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the      
reader with a journal of it. The Captain called in at one or two            
ports, and sent in his long-boat for provisions and fresh water, but I      
never went out of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on        
the third day of June, 1706, about nine months after my escape. I           
offered to leave my goods in security for payment of my freight; but        
the Captain protested he would not receive one farthing. We took            
kind leave of each other, and I made him promise he would come to           
see me at my house in Redriff. I hired a horse and guide for five           
shillings, which I borrowed of the Captain.                                 
  As I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the         
trees, the cattle, and the people, I began to think myself in               
Lilliput. I was afraid of trampling on every traveler I met, and often      
called aloud to have them stand out of the way, so that I had like          
to have gotten one or two broken heads for my impertinence.                 
                                                    {P_2|CH_8 ^paragraph 15}
  When I came to my own house, for which I was forced to enquire,           
one of the servants opening the door, I bent down to go in (like a          
goose under a gate) for fear of striking my head. My wife ran out to        
embrace me, but I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could          
otherwise never be able to reach my mouth. My daughter kneeled to           
ask my blessing, but I could not see her till she arose, having been        
so long used to stand with my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet;      
and then I went to take her up with one hand, by the waist. I looked        
down upon the servants and one or two friends who were in the house,        
as if they had been pigmies, and I a giant. I told my wife, she had         
been too thrifty, for I found she had starved herself and her daughter      
to nothing. In short, I behaved myself so unaccountably, that they          
were all of the Captain's opinion when he first saw me, and                 
concluded I had lost my wits. This I mention as an instance of the          
great power of habit and prejudice.                                         
  In a little time I and my family and friends came to a right              
understanding: but my wife protested I should never go to sea any           
more; although my evil destiny so ordered that she had not power to         
hinder me, as the reader may know hereafter. In the mean time I here        
conclude the second part of my unfortunate voyages.

  CHAPTER I                                                                 
-                                                                           
  I had not been at home above ten days, when Captain William               
Robinson, a Cornish man, Commander of the Hope-well, a stout ship of        
three hundred tons, came to my house. I had formerly been surgeon of        
another ship where he was master, and a fourth part owner, in a voyage      
to the Levant; he had always treated me more like a brother than an         
inferior officer, and hearing of my arrival made me a visit, as I           
apprehended only out of friendship, for nothing passed more than            
what is usual after long absences. But repeating his visits often,          
expressing his joy to find me in good health, asking whether I were         
now settled for life, adding that he intended a voyage to the East          
Indies in two months; at last he plainly invited me, though with            
some apologies, to be surgeon of the ship; that I should have               
another surgeon under me besides our two mates; that my salary              
should be double to the usual pay; and that having experienced my           
knowledge in sea affairs to be at least equal to his, he would enter        
into any engagement to follow my advice, as much as if I had share          
in the command.                                                             
  He said so many other obliging things, and I knew him to be so            
honest a man, that I could not reject his proposal; the thirst I had        
of seeing the world, notwithstanding my past misfortunes, continuing        
as violent as ever. The only difficulty that remained, was to persuade      
my wife, whose consent however I at last obtained by the prospect of        
advantage she proposed to her children.                                     
  We set out the 5th of August, 1706, and arrived at Fort St. George        
the 11th of April 1707. We stayed there three weeks to refresh our          
crew, many of whom were sick. From there we went to Tonquin, where the      
Captain resolved to continue some time, because many of the goods he        
intended to buy were not ready, nor could he expect to be dispatched        
in some months. Therefore in hopes to defray some of the charges he         
must be at, he bought a sloop, loaded it with several sorts of              
goods, wherewith the Tonquinese usually trade to the neighboring            
islands, and putting fourteen men on board, whereof three were of           
the country, he appointed me master of the sloop, and gave me power to      
traffic for two months, while he transacted his affairs at Tonquin.         
  We had not sailed more than three days, when a great storm                
arising, we were driven five days to the north-northeast, and then          
to the east; after which we had fair weather, but still with a              
pretty strong gale from the west. Upon the tenth day we were chased by      
two pirates, who soon overtook us, for my sloop was so deep loaden,         
that she sailed very slow, neither were we in a condition to defend         
ourselves.                                                                  
  We were boarded about the same time by both the pirates, who entered      
furiously at the head of their men, but finding us all prostrate            
upon our faces (for so I gave order) they pinioned us with strong           
ropes, and setting a guard upon us, went to search the sloop.               
                                                     {P_3|CH_1 ^paragraph 5}
  I observed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some                
authority, though he was not commander of either ship. He knew us by        
our countenances to be Englishmen, and jabbering to us in his own           
language, swore we should be tied back to back, and thrown into the         
sea. I spoke Dutch tolerably well; I told him who we were, and              
begged him in consideration of our being Christians and Protestants,        
of neighboring countries, in strict alliance, that he would move the        
Captains to take some pity on us. This inflamed his rage; he                
repeated his threatenings, and turning to his companions, spoke with        
great vehemence, in the Japanese language, as I suppose, often using        
the word Christianos.                                                       
  The largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a Japanese           
Captain, who spoke a little Dutch, but very imperfectly. He came up to      
me, and after several questions, which I answered in great humility,        
he said we should not die. I made the Captain a very low bow, and then      
turning to the Dutchman, said, I was sorry to find more mercy in a          
heathen, than in a brother Christian. But I had soon reason to              
repent those foolish words; for that malicious reprobate, having often      
endeavored in vain to persuade both the Captains that I might be            
thrown into the sea (which they would not yield to after the promise        
made me, that I should not die), however prevailed so far as to have a      
punishment inflicted on me, worse in all human appearance than death        
itself. My men were sent by an equal division into both the pirate          
ships, and my sloop new manned. As to myself, it was determined that I      
should be set adrift in a small canoe, with paddles and a sail, and         
four days' provisions, which last the Japanese Captain was so kind          
to double out of his own stores, and would permit no man to search me.      
I got down into the canoe, while the Dutchman standing upon the deck,       
loaded me with all the curses and injurious terms his language could        
afford.                                                                     
  About an hour before we saw the pirates, I had taken an observation,      
and found we were in the latitude of 46 N. and of longitude 183.            
When I was at some distance from the pirates, I discovered by my            
pocket glass several islands to the southeast. I set up my sail, the        
wind being fair, with a design to reach the nearest of those                
islands, which I made a shift to do in about three hours. It was all        
rocky; however I got many birds' eggs, and striking fire, I kindled         
some heath and dry seaweed, by which I roasted my eggs. I ate no other      
supper, being resolved to spare my provisions as much as I could. I         
passed the night under the shelter of a rock, strowing some heath           
under me, and slept pretty well.                                            
  The next day I sailed to another island, and then to a third and          
fourth, sometimes using my sail, and sometimes my paddles. But not          
to trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses,           
let it suffice that on the fifth day I arrived at the last island in        
my sight, which lay south-southeast to the former.                          
  This island was at a greater distance than I expected, and I did not      
reach it in less than five hours. I encompassed it almost around            
before I could find a convenient place to land in, which was a small        
creek about three times the wideness of my canoe. I found the island        
to be all rocky, only a little intermingled with tufts of grass and         
sweet smelling herbs. I took out my small provisions, and after having      
refreshed myself, I secured the remainder in a cave, whereof there          
were great numbers. I gathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and           
got a quantity of dry seaweed and parched grass, which I designed to        
kindle the next day, and roast my eggs as well as I could. (For I           
had about me my flint, steel, match, and burning glass.) I lay all          
night in the cave where I had lodged my provisions. My bed was the          
same dry grass and seaweed which I intended for fuel. I slept very          
little, for the disquiets of my mind prevailed over my weariness,           
and kept me awake. I considered how impossible it was to preserve my        
life in so desolate a place, and how miserable my end must be. Yet I        
found myself so listless and desponding that I had not the heart to         
rise, and before I could get spirits enough to creep out of my cave         
the day was far advanced. I walked a while among the rocks; the sky         
was perfectly clear, and the sun so hot that I was forced to turn my        
face from it; when all of a sudden it became obscured, as I thought,        
in a manner very different from what happens by the interposition of a      
cloud. I turned back, and perceived a vast opaque body between me           
and the sun, moving forwards towards the island: it seemed to be about      
two miles high, and hid the sun six or seven minutes, but I did not         
observe the air to be much colder, or the sky more darkened, than if I      
had stood under the shade of a mountain. As it approached nearer            
over the place where I was, it appeared to be a firm substance, the         
bottom flat, smooth, and shining very bright from the reflection of         
the sea below. I stood upon a height about two hundred yards from           
the shore, and saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with      
me, at less than an English mile distance. I took out my pocket             
perspective, and could plainly discover numbers of people moving up         
and down the sides of it, which appeared to be sloping, but what those      
people were doing, I was not able to distinguish.                           
                                                    {P_3|CH_1 ^paragraph 10}
  The natural love of life gave me some inward motions of joy, and I        
was ready to entertain a hope that this adventure might some way or         
other help to deliver me from the desolate place and condition I was        
in. But at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my                  
astonishment, to behold an island in the air, inhabited by men, who         
were able (as it should seem) to raise or sink, or put it into a            
progressive motion, as they pleased. But not being at that time in a        
disposition to philosophise upon this phenomenon, I rather chose to         
observe what course the island would take, because it seemed for a          
while to stand still. Yet soon after it advanced nearer, and I could        
see the sides of it, encompassed with several gradations of galleries,      
and stairs at certain intervals, to descend from one to the other.          
In the lowest gallery I beheld some people fishing with long angling        
rods, and others looking on. I waved my cap (for my hat was long since      
worn out) and my handkerchief towards the island; and upon its              
nearer approach, I called and shouted with the utmost strength of my        
voice; and then looking circumspectly, I beheld a crowd gather to that      
side which was most in my view. I found by their pointing towards me        
and to each other, that they plainly discovered me, although they made      
no return to my shouting. But I could see four or five men running          
in great haste up the stairs to the top of the island, who then             
disappeared. I happened rightly to conjecture, that these were sent         
for orders to some person in authority upon this occasion.                  
  The number of people increased, and in less than half an hour the         
island was moved and raised in such a manner, that the lowest               
gallery appeared in a parallel of less than a hundred yards distance        
from the height where I stood. I then put myself into the most              
supplicating postures, and spoke in the humblest accent, but                
received no answer. Those who stood nearest over against me seemed          
to be persons of distinction, as I supposed by their habit. They            
conferred earnestly with each other, looking often upon me. At              
length one of them called out in a clear, polite, smooth dialect,           
not unlike in sound to the Italian; and therefore I returned an answer      
in that language, hoping at least that the cadence might be more            
agreeable to his ears. Although neither of us understood the other,         
yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the distress I was      
in.                                                                         
  They made signs for me to come down from the rock and go towards the      
shore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised          
to a convenient height, the verge directly over me, a chain was let         
down from the lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to        
which I fixed myself, and was drawn up by pulleys.                          
                                                                            
P_3|CH_2                                                                    
  CHAPTER II                                                                
-                                                                           
  At my alighting I was surrounded by a crowd of people, but those who      
stood nearest seemed to be of better quality. They beheld me with           
all the marks and circumstances of wonder; neither indeed was I much        
in their debt, having never till then seen a race of mortals so             
singular in their shapes, habits, and countenances. Their heads were        
all reclined either to the right or the left; one of their eyes turned      
inward, and the other directly up to the zenith. Their outward              
garments were adorned with the figures of suns, moons, and stars,           
interwoven with those of fiddles, flutes, harps, trumpets, guitars,         
harpsichords, and many other instruments of music, unknown to us in         
Europe. I observed here and there many in the habit of servants,            
with a blown bladder fastened like a flail to the end of a short            
stick, which they carried in their hands. In each bladder was a             
small quantity of dried pease, or little pebbles (as I was                  
afterwards informed). With these bladders they now and then flapped         
the mouths and ears of those who stood near them, of which practice         
I could not then conceive the meaning; it seems the minds of these          
people are so taken up with intense speculations, that they neither         
can speak, nor attend to the discourses of others, without being            
roused by some external taction upon the organs of speech and hearing;      
for which reason those persons who are able to afford it always keep a      
flapper (the original is climenole) in their family, as one of their        
domestics, nor ever walk abroad or make visits without him. And the         
business of this officer is, when two or more persons are in                
company, gently to strike with his bladder the mouth of him who is          
to speak, and the right ear of him or them to whom the speaker              
addresses himself. This flapper is likewise employed diligently to          
attend his master in his walks, and upon occasion to give him a soft        
flap on his eyes, because he is always so wrapped up in cogitation,         
that he is in manifest danger of falling down every precipice, and          
bouncing his head against every post, and in the streets, of                
jostling others, or being jostled himself into the kennel.                  
  It was necessary to give the reader this information, without             
which he would be at the same loss with me, to understand the               
proceedings of these people, as they conducted me the stairs, to the        
top of the island, and from there to the royal palace. While we were        
ascending, they forgot several times what they were about, and left         
me to myself, till their memories were again roused by their                
flappers; for they appeared altogether unmoved by the sight of my           
foreign habit and countenance, and by the shouts of the vulgar,             
whose thoughts and minds were more disengaged.                              
  At last we entered the palace, and proceeded into the chamber of          
presence, where I saw the King seated on his throne, attended on            
each side by persons of prime quality. Before the throne was a large        
table filled with globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments          
of all kinds. His Majesty took not the least notice of us, although         
our entrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of all      
persons belonging to the court. But he was then deep in a problem, and      
we attended at least an hour, before he could solve it. There stood by      
him on each side a young page, with flaps in their hands, and when          
they saw he was at leisure, one of them gently struck his mouth, and        
the other his right ear; at which he started like one awakened on           
the sudden, and looking towards me and the company I was in,                
recollected the occasion of our coming, whereof he had been informed        
before. He spoke some words, whereupon immediately a young man with         
a flap came up to my side, and flapped me gently on the right ear; but      
I made signs, as well as I could, that I had no occasion for such an        
instrument; which, as I afterwards found, gave his Majesty and the          
whole court a very mean opinion of my understanding. The King, as           
far as I could conjecture, asked me several questions, and I addressed      
myself to him in all the languages I had. When it was found that I          
could neither understand nor be understood, I was conducted by the          
King's order to an apartment in his palace (this prince being               
distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to             
strangers), where two servants were appointed to attend me. My              
dinner was brought, and four persons of quality, whom I remembered          
to have seen very near the King's person, did me the honor to dine          
with me. We had two courses of three dishes each. In the first              
course there was a shoulder of mutton, cut into an equilateral              
triangle, a piece of beef into a rhomboides, and a pudding into a           
cycloid. The second course was two ducks, trussed up into the form          
of fiddles; sausages and puddings resembling flutes and hautboys,           
and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp. The servants cut our           
bread into cones, cylinders, parallelograms, and several other              
mathematical figures.                                                       
  While we were at dinner, I made bold to ask the names of several          
things in their language; and those noble persons, by the assistance        
of their flappers, delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my         
admiration of their great abilities, if I could be brought to converse      
with them. I was soon able to call for bread and drink, or whatever         
else I wanted.                                                              
  After dinner my company withdrew, and a person was sent to me by the      
King's order, attended by a flapper. He brought with him pen, ink, and      
paper, and three or four books, giving me to understand by signs, that      
he was sent to teach me the language. We sat together four hours, in        
which time I wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the        
translations over against them. I likewise made a shift to learn            
several short sentences. For my tutor would order one of my servants        
to fetch something, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or stand, or      
walk, and the like. Then I took down the sentence in writing. He            
showed me also in one of his books the figures of the sun, moon, and        
stars, the zodiac, the tropics, and polar circles, together with the        
denominations of many figures of planes and solids. He gave me the          
names and descriptions of all the musical instruments, and the general      
terms of art in playing on each of them. After he had left me, I            
placed all my words with their interpretations in alphabetical              
order. And thus in a few days, by the help of a very faithful               
memory, I got some insight into their language.                             
                                                     {P_3|CH_2 ^paragraph 5}
  The word, which I interpret the Flying or Floating Island, is in the      
original Laputa, whereof I could never learn the true etymology. Lap        
in the old obsolete language signifies high, and untuh, a governor,         
from which they say by corruption was derived Laputa, from Lapuntuh.        
But I do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a little         
strained. I ventured to offer to the learned among them a conjecture        
of my own, that Laputa was quasi lap outed; lap signifying properly         
the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea, and outed, a wing, which            
however I shall not obtrude, but submit to the judicious reader.            
  Those to whom the King had entrusted me, observing how ill I was          
clad, ordered a tailor to come next morning, and take my measure for a      
suit of clothes. This operator did his office after a different manner      
from those of his trade in Europe. He first took my height by a             
quadrant, and then with a rule and compasses described the                  
dimensions and outlines of my whole body, all which he entered upon         
paper, and in six days brought my clothes very ill made, and quite out      
of shape, by happening to mistake a figure in the calculation. But          
my comfort was, that I observed such accidents very frequent, and           
little regarded.                                                            
  During my confinement for want of clothes, and by an indisposition        
that held me some days longer, I much enlarged my dictionary; and when      
I went next to court, was able to understand many things the King           
spoke, and to return him some kind of answers. His Majesty had given        
orders that the island should move northeast and by east, to the            
vertical point over Lagado, the metropolis of the whole kingdom             
below upon the firm earth. It was about ninety leagues distant, and         
our voyage lasted four days and an half. I was not in the least             
sensible of the progressive motion made in the air by the island. On        
the second morning about eleven o'clock, the King himself in person,        
attended by his nobility, courtiers, and officers, having prepared all      
their musical instruments, played on them for three hours without           
intermission, so that I was quite stunned with the noise; neither           
could I possibly guess the meaning, till my tutor informed me. He said      
that the people of their island had their ears adapted to hear the          
music of the spheres, which always played at certain periods, and           
the court was now prepared to bear their part in whatever instrument        
they most excelled.                                                         
  In our journey towards Lagado, the capital city, his Majesty ordered      
that the island should stop over certain towns and villages, from           
whence he might receive the petitions of his subjects. And to this          
purpose several packthreads were let down with small weights at the         
bottom. On these packthreads the people strung their petitions,             
which mounted up directly like the scraps of paper fastened by              
school boys at the end of the string that holds their kite.                 
Sometimes we received wine and victuals from below, which were drawn        
up by pulleys.                                                              
  The knowledge I had in mathematics gave me great assistance in            
acquiring their phraseology, which depended much upon that science and      
music; and in the latter I was not unskilled. Their ideas are               
perpetually conversant in lines and figures. If they would, for             
example, praise the beauty of a woman, or any other animal, they            
describe it by rhombs, circles, parallelograms, ellipses, and other         
geometrical terms, or by words of art drawn from music, needless            
here to repeat. I observed in the King's kitchen all sorts of               
mathematical and musical instruments, after the figures of which            
they cut up the joints that were served to his Majesty's table.             
                                                    {P_3|CH_2 ^paragraph 10}
  Their houses are very ill built, the walls bevel without one right        
angle in any apartment, and this defect arises from the contempt            
they bear to practical geometry, which they despise as vulgar and           
mechanic, those instructions they give being too refined for the            
intellectuals of their workmen, which occasions perpetual mistakes.         
And although they are dexterous enough upon a piece of paper in the         
management of the rule, the pencil, and the divider, yet in the common      
actions and behavior of life, I have not seen a more clumsy,                
awkward, and unhandy people, nor so slow and perplexed in their             
conceptions upon all other subjects, except those of mathematics and        
music. They are very bad reasoners, and vehemently given to                 
opposition, unless when they happen to be of the right opinion,             
which is seldom their case. Imagination, fancy, and invention, they         
are wholly strangers to, nor have any words in their language by which      
those ideas can be expressed; the whole compass of their thoughts           
and mind being shut up within the two forementioned sciences.               
  Most of them, and especially those who deal in the astronomical           
part, have great faith in judicial astrology, although they are             
ashamed to own it publicly. But what I chiefly admired, and thought         
altogether unaccountable, was the strong disposition I observed in          
them towards news and politics, perpetually enquiring into public           
affairs, giving their judgments in matters of state, and                    
passionately disputing every inch of a party opinion. I have indeed         
observed the same disposition among most of the mathematicians I            
have known in Europe, although I could never discover the least             
analogy between the two sciences; unless those people suppose, that         
because the smallest circle hath as many degrees as the largest,            
therefore the regulation and management of the world require no more        
abilities than the handling and turning of a globe. But I rather            
take this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human           
nature, inclining us to be more curious and conceited in matters where      
we have least concern, and for which we are least adapted either by         
study or nature.                                                            
  These people are under continual disquietudes, never enjoying a           
minute's peace of mind; and their disturbances proceed from causes          
which very little affect the rest of mortals. Their apprehensions           
arise from several changes they dread in the celestial bodies. For          
instance, that the earth, by the continual approaches of the sun            
towards it, must in course of time be absorbed or swallowed up. That        
the face of the sun will by degrees be encrusted with its own               
effluvia, and give no more light to the world. That the earth very          
narrowly escaped a brush from the tail of the last comet, which             
would have infallibly reduced it to ashes; and that the next, which         
they have calculated for thirty-one years hence, will probably destroy      
us. For if in its perihelion it should approach within a certain            
degree of the sun (as by their calculations they have reason to dread)      
it will conceive a degree of heat ten thousand times more intense than      
that of red-hot glowing iron; and in its absence from the sun, carry a      
blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen miles long; through          
which if the earth should pass at the distance of one hundred thousand      
miles from the nucleus or main body of the comet, it must in its            
passage be set on fire, and reduced to ashes. That the sun daily            
spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them, will at last        
be wholly consumed and annihilated; which must be attended with the         
destruction of this earth, and of all the planets that receive their        
light from it.                                                              
  They are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these           
and the like impending dangers, that they can neither sleep quietly in      
their beds, nor have any relish for the common pleasures or amusements      
of life. When they meet an acquaintance in the morning, the first           
question is about the sun's health, how he looked at his setting and        
rising, and what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the                 
approaching comet. This conversation they are apt to run into with the      
same temper that boys discover, in delighting to hear terrible stories      
of sprites and hobgoblins, which they greedily listen to, and dare not      
go to bed for fear.                                                         
  The women of the island have abundance of vivacity: they contemn          
their husbands, and are exceedingly fond of strangers, whereof there        
is always a considerable number from the continent below, attending at      
court, either upon affairs of the several towns and corporations, or        
their own particular occasions, but are much despised, because they         
want the same endowments. Among these the ladies choose their               
gallants: but the vexation is, that they act with too much ease and         
security, for the husband is always so rapt in speculation, that the        
mistress and lover may proceed to the greatest familiarities before         
his face, if he be but provided with paper and implements, and without      
his flapper at his side.                                                    
                                                    {P_3|CH_2 ^paragraph 15}
  The wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island,           
although I think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world;         
and although they live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence,        
and are allowed to do whatever they please, they long to see the            
world, and take the diversions of the metropolis, which they are not        
allowed to do without a particular license from the King; and this          
is not easy to be obtained, because the people of quality have found        
by frequent experience how hard it is to persuade their women to            
return from below. I was told that a great court lady, who had several      
children, is married to the prime minister, the richest subject in the      
kingdom, a very graceful person, extremely fond of her, and lives in        
the finest palace of the island, went down to Lagado, on the                
pretense of health, there hid herself for several months, till the          
King sent a warrant to search for her, and she was found in an obscure      
eatinghouse all in rags, having pawned her clothes to maintain an           
old deformed footman, who beat her every day, and in whose company she      
was taken much against her will. And although her husband received her      
with all possible kindness, and without the least reproach, she soon        
after contrived to steal down again with all her jewels, to the same        
gallant, and has not been heard of since.                                   
  This may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an European or           
English story, than for one of a country so remote. But he may              
please to consider, that the caprices of are not limited by any             
climate or nation, and that they are much more uniform than can be          
easily imagined.                                                            
  In about a month's time I had made a tolerable proficiency in             
their language, and was able to answer most of the King's questions,        
when I had the honor to attend him. His Majesty discovered not the          
least curiosity to inquire into the laws, government, history,              
religion, or manners of the countries where I had been, but confined        
his questions to the state of mathematics, and received the account         
I gave him with great contempt and indifference, though often roused        
by his flapper on each side.                                                
                                                                            
P_3|CH_3                                                                    
  CHAPTER III                                                               
-                                                                           
  I desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island,      
which he was graciously pleased to grant, and ordered my tutor to           
attend me. I chiefly wanted to know to what cause in art or in              
nature it owed its several motions, whereof I will now give a               
philosophical account to the reader.                                        
  The Flying or Floating Island is exactly circular, its diameter 7837      
yards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten        
thousand acres. It is three hundred yards thick. The bottom or under        
surface, which appears to those who view it from below, is one even         
regular plate of adamant, shooting up to the height of about two            
hundred yards. Above it lie the several minerals in their usual order,      
and over all is a coat of rich mold, ten or twelve feet deep. The           
declivity of the upper surface, from the circumference to the               
center, is the natural cause why all the dews and rains which fall          
upon the island, are conveyed in small rivulets toward the middle,          
where they are emptied into four large basins, each of about half a         
mile in circuit, and two hundred yards distant from the center. From        
these basins the water is continually exhaled by the sun in the             
daytime, which effectually prevents their overflowing. Besides, as          
it is in the power of the monarch to raise the island above the region      
of clouds and vapors, he can prevent the falling of dews and rains          
whenever he pleases. For the highest clouds cannot rise above two           
miles, as naturalists agree, at least they were never known to do so        
in that country.                                                            
  At the centre of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in         
diameter, from whence the astronomers descend into a large dome, which      
is therefore called Flandona Gagnole, or the Astronomer's Cave,             
situated at the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface          
of the adamant. In this cave are twenty lamps continually burning,          
which from the reflection of the adamant cast a strong light into           
every part. The place is stored with great variety of sextants,             
quadrants, telescopes, astrolabes, and other astronomical instruments.      
But the greatest curiosity, upon which the fate of the island depends,      
is a loadstone of a prodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver's         
shuttle. It is in length six yards, and in the thickest part at             
least three yards over. This magnet is sustained by a very strong axle      
of adamant passing through its middle, upon which it plays, and is          
poised so exactly that the weakest hand can turn it. It is hooped           
round with a hollow cylinder of adamant, four feet deep, as many            
thick, and twelve yards in diameter, placed horizontally, and               
supported by eight adamantine feet, each six yards high. In the middle      
of the concave side there is a groove twelve inches deep, in which the      
extremities of the axle are lodged, and turned round as there is            
occasion.                                                                   
  The stone cannot be moved from its place by any force, because the        
hoop and its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant         
which constitutes the bottom of the island.                                 
  By means of this loadstone, the island is made to rise and fall, and      
move from one place to another. For with respect to that part of the        
earth over which the monarch presides, the stone is endued at one of        
its sides with an attractive power, and at the other with a repulsive.      
Upon placing the magnet erect with its attracting end towards the           
earth, the island descends; but when the repelling extremity points         
downwards, the island mounts directly upwards. When the position of         
the stone is oblique, the motion of the island is so too. For in            
this magnet the forces always act in lines parallel to its direction.       
                                                     {P_3|CH_3 ^paragraph 5}
                             (SEE PLATE 4)                                  
  By this oblique motion the island is conveyed to different parts          
of the monarch's dominions. To explain the manner of its progress, let      
AB represent a line drawn cross the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the        
line cd represent the loadstone, of which let d be the repelling            
end, and c the attracting end, the island being over C; let the             
stone be placed in the position cd, with its repelling end                  
downwards; then the island will be driven upwards obliquely towards D.      
When it is arrived at D, let the stone be turned upon its axle, till        
its attracting end points towards E, and then the island will be            
carried obliquely towards E; where if the stone be again turned upon        
its axle till it stands in the position EF, with its repelling point        
downwards, the island will rise obliquely towards F, where by               
directing the attracting end towards G, the island may be carried to        
G, and from G to H, by turning the stone, so as to make its                 
repelling extremity point directly downwards. And thus by changing the      
situation of the stone as often as there is occasion, the island is         
made to rise and fall by turns in an oblique direction, and by those        
alternate risings and fallings (the obliquity being not                     
considerable) is conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other.      
  But it must be observed that this island cannot move beyond the           
extent of the dominions below, nor can it rise above the height of          
four miles. For which the astronomers (who have written large               
systems concerning the stone) assign the following reason: that the         
magnetic virtue does not extend beyond the distance of four Miles, and      
that the mineral which acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth,      
and in the sea about six leagues distant from the shore, is not             
diffused through the whole globe, but terminated with the limits of         
the King's dominions; and it was easy from the great advantage of such      
a superior situation, for a prince to bring under his obedience             
whatever country lay within the attraction of that magnet.                  
  When the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the           
island stands still; for in that case the extremities of it being at        
equal distance from the earth, act with equal force, the one in             
drawing downwards, the other in pushing upwards, and consequently no        
motion can ensue.                                                           
  This loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers, who from         
time to time give it such positions as the monarch directs. They spend      
the greatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies,         
which they do by the assistance of glasses far excelling ours in            
goodness. For although their largest telescopes do not exceed three         
feet, they magnify much more than those of a hundred yards among us,        
and at the same time show the stars with greater clearness. This            
advantage has enabled them to extend their discoveries much farther         
than our astronomers in Europe; for they have made a catalogue of           
ten thousand fixed stars, whereas the largest of ours do not contain        
above one third part of that number. They have likewise discovered two      
lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about Mars, whereof the          
innermost is distant from the center of the primary planet exactly          
three of his diameters, and the outermost five; the former revolves in      
the space of ten hours, and the latter in twenty-one and a half; so         
that the squares of their periodical times are very near in the same        
proportion with the cubes of their distance from the center of Mars,        
which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of                
gravitation that influences the other heavenly bodies.                      
                                                    {P_3|CH_3 ^paragraph 10}
  They have observed ninety-three different comets, and settled             
their periods with great exactness. If this be true (and they affirm        
it with great confidence), it is much to be wished that their               
observations were made public, whereby the theory of comets, which          
at present is very lame and defective, might be brought to the same         
perfection with other parts of astronomy.                                   
  The King would be the most absolute prince in the universe, if he         
could but prevail on a ministry to join with him; but these having          
their estates below on the continent, and considering that the              
office of a favorite has a very uncertain tenure, would never               
consent to the enslaving their country.                                     
  If any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny, fall into               
violent factions, or refuse to pay the usual tribute, the King has two      
methods of reducing them to obedience. The first and the mildest            
course by keeping the island hovering over such a town, and the             
lands about it, whereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the           
sun and the rain, and consequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth      
and diseases. And if the crime deserve it, they are at the same time        
pelted from above with great stones, against which they have no             
defense but by creeping into cellars or caves, while the roofs of           
their houses are beaten to pieces. But if they still continue               
obstinate, or offer to raise insurrections, he proceeds to the last         
remedy, by letting the island drop directly upon their heads, which         
makes a universal destruction both of houses and men. However, this is      
an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven, neither indeed is        
he willing to put it in execution, nor dare his ministers advise him        
to an action, which as it would render them odious to the people, so        
it would be a great damage to their own estates, which lie all              
below, for the island is the King's demesne.                                
  But there is still indeed a more weighty reason, why the kings of         
this country have been always averse from executing so terrible an          
action, unless upon the utmost necessity. For if the town intended          
to be destroyed should have in it any tall rocks, as it generally           
falls out in the larger cities, a situation probably chosen at first        
with a view to prevent such a catastrophe; or if it abound in high          
spires, or pillars of stone, a sudden fall might endanger the bottom        
or under surface of the island, which, although it consist, as I            
have said, of one entire adamant two hundred yards thick, might happen      
to crack by too great a shock, or burst by approaching too near the         
fires from the houses below, as the backs both of iron and stone            
will often do in our chimneys. Of all this the people are well              
apprised, and understand how far to carry their obstinacy, where their      
liberty or property is concerned. And the King, when he is highest          
provoked, and most determined to press a city to rubbish, orders the        
island to descend with great gentleness, out of a pretense of               
tenderness to his people, but indeed for fear of breaking the               
adamantine bottom; in which case it is the opinion of all their             
philosophers that the loadstone could no longer hold it up, and the         
whole mass would fall to the ground.                                        
  About three years before my arrival among them, while the King was        
in his progress over his dominions, there happened an extraordinary         
accident which had like to have put a period to the fate of that            
monarchy, at least as it is now instituted. Lindalino, the second city      
in the kingdom, was the first his Majesty visited in his progress.          
Three days after his departure the inhabitants, who had often               
complained of great oppressions, shut the town gates, seized on the         
governor, and with incredible speed and labor erected four large            
towers, one at every corner of the city (which is an exact square),         
equal in height to a strong pointed rock that stands directly in the        
center of the city. Upon the top of each tower, as well as upon the         
rock, they fixed a great loadstone, and in case their design should         
fail, they had provided a vast quantity of the most combustible             
fuel, hoping to burst therewith the adamantine bottom of the island,        
if the loadstone project should miscarry.                                   
                                                    {P_3|CH_3 ^paragraph 15}
  It was eight months before the King had perfect notice that the           
Lindalinians were in rebellion. He then commanded that the island           
should be wafted over the city. The people were unanimous, and had          
laid in stores of provisions, and a great river runs through the            
middle of the town. The King hovered over them several days to deprive      
them of the sun and the rain. He ordered many packthreads to be let         
down, yet not a person offered to send up a petition, but instead           
thereof very bold demands, the redress of all their grievances,             
great immunities, the choice of their own governor, and other like          
exorbitances. Upon which his Majesty commanded all the inhabitants          
of the island to cast great stones from the lower gallery into the          
town; but the citizens had provided against this mischief by conveying      
their persons and effects into the four towers, and other strong            
buildings, and vaults underground.                                          
  The King being now determined to reduce this proud people, ordered        
that the island should descend gently within forty yards of the top of      
the towers and rock. This was accordingly done; but the officers            
employed in that work found the descent much speedier than usual,           
and by turning the loadstone could not without great difficulty keep        
it in a firm position, but found the island inclining to fall. They         
sent the King immediate intelligence of this astonishing event, and         
begged his Majesty's permission to raise the island higher; the King        
consented, a general council was called, and the officers of the            
loadstone ordered to attend. One of the oldest and most expert among        
them obtained leave to try an experiment. He took a strong line of a        
hundred yards, and the island being raised over the town above the          
attracting power they had felt, he fastened a piece of adamant to           
the end of his line, which had in it a mixture of iron mineral, of the      
same nature with that whereof the bottom or lower surface of the            
island is composed, and from the lower gallery let it down slowly           
towards the top of the towers. The adamant was not descended four           
yards, before the officer felt it drawn so strongly downward that he        
could hardly pull it back. He then threw down several small pieces          
of adamant, and observed that they were all violently attracted by the      
top of the tower. The same experiment was made on the other three           
towers, and on the rock with the same effect.                               
  This incident broke entirely the King's measures, and (to dwell no        
longer on other circumstances) he was forced to give the town their         
own conditions.                                                             
  I was assured by a great minister that if the island had descended        
so near the town as not to be able to raise itself, the citizens            
were determined to fix it for ever, to kill the King and all his            
servants, and entirely change the government.                               
  By a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king, nor either          
of his two elder sons, are permitted to leave the island; nor the           
queen, till she is past child-bearing.                                      
                                                                            
P_3|CH_4                                                                    
  CHAPTER IV                                                                
-                                                                           
  Although I cannot say that I was ill treated in this island, yet I        
must confess I thought myself too much neglected, not without some          
degree of contempt. For neither prince nor people appeared to be            
curious in any part of knowledge, except mathematics and music,             
wherein I was far their inferior, and upon that account very little         
regarded.                                                                   
  On the other side, after having seen all the curiosities of the           
island, I was very desirous to leave it, being heartily weary of those      
people. They were indeed excellent in two sciences for which I have         
great esteem, and wherein I am not unversed; but at the same time so        
abstracted and involved in speculation, that I never met with such          
disagreeable companions. I conversed only with women, tradesmen,            
flappers, and court pages, during two months of my abode there, by          
which at last I rendered myself extremely contemptible; yet these were      
the only people from whom I could ever receive a reasonable answer.         
  I had obtained by hard study a good degree of knowledge in their          
language; I was weary of being confined to an island where I                
received so little countenance, and resolved to leave it with the           
first opportunity.                                                          
  There was a great lord at court, nearly related to the King, and for      
that reason alone used with respect. He was universally reckoned the        
most ignorant and stupid person among them. He had performed many           
eminent services for the crown, had great natural and acquired              
parts, adorned with integrity and honor, but so ill an ear for              
music, that his detractors reported he had been often known to beat         
time in the wrong place; neither could his tutors without extreme           
difficulty teach him to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the        
mathematics. He was pleased to show me many marks of favor, often           
did me the honor of a visit, desired to be informed in the affairs          
of Europe, the laws and customs, the manners and learning of the            
several countries where I had traveled. He listened to me with great        
attention, and made very wise observations on all I spoke. He had           
two flappers attending him for state, but never made use of them            
except at court, and in visits of ceremony, and would always command        
them to withdraw when we were alone together.                               
  I entreated this illustrious person to intercede in my behalf with        
his Majesty for leave to depart, which he accordingly did, as he was        
pleased to tell me, with regret: for indeed he had made me several          
offers very advantageous, which however I refused with expressions          
of the highest acknowledgment.                                              
                                                     {P_3|CH_4 ^paragraph 5}
  On the 16th day of February I took leave of his Majesty and the           
court. The King made me a present to the value of about two hundred         
pounds English, and my protector his kinsman as much more, together         
with a letter of recommendation to a friend of his in Lagado, the           
metropolis. The island being then hovering over a mountain about two        
miles from it, I was let down from the lowest gallery, in the same          
manner as I had been taken up.                                              
  The continent, as far as it is subject to the monarch of the              
Flying Island, passes under the general name of Balnibarbi, and the         
metropolis, as I said before, is called Lagado. I felt some little          
satisfaction in finding myself on firm ground. I walked to the city         
without any concern, being clad like one of the natives, and                
sufficiently instructed to converse with them. I soon found out the         
person's house to whom I was ended, presented my letter from his            
friend the grandee in the island, and was received with much kindness.      
This great lord, whose name was Munodi, ordered me an apartment in his      
own house, where I continued during my stay, and was entertained in         
a most hospitable manner.                                                   
  The next morning after my arrival, he took me in his chariot to           
see the town, which is about half the size of London, but the houses        
very strangely built, and most of them out of repair. The people in         
the streets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were            
generally in rags. We passed through one of the town gates, and went        
about three miles into the country, where I saw many laborers               
working with several sorts of tools in the ground, but was not able to      
conjecture what they were about; neither did I observe any expectation      
either of corn or grass, although the soil appeared to be excellent. I      
could not forbear admiring at these odd appearances both in town and        
country, and I made bold to desire my conductor, that he would be           
pleased to explain to me what could be meant by so many busy heads,         
hands, and faces, both in the streets and the fields, because I did         
not discover any good effects they produced; but on the contrary, I         
never knew a soil so unhappily cultivated, houses so ill contrived and      
so ruinous, or a people whose countenances and habit expressed so much      
misery and want.                                                            
  This Lord Munodi was a person of the first rank, and had been some        
years Governor of Lagado, but by a cabal of ministers was discharged        
for insufficiency. However, the King treated him with tenderness, as a      
well-meaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.                  
  When I gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants, he      
made no further answer than by telling me that I had not been long          
enough among them to form a judgment, and that the different nations        
of the world had different customs, with other common topics to the         
same purpose. But when we returned to his palace, he asked me how I         
liked the building, what absurdities I observed, and what quarrel I         
had with the dress or looks of his domestics. This he might safely do,      
because every thing about him was magnificent, regular, and polite.         
I answered that his Excellency's prudence, quality, and fortune, had        
exempted him from those defects which folly and beggary had produced        
in others. He said if I would go with him to his country house,             
about twenty miles distant, where his estate lay, there would be            
more leisure for this kind of conversation. I told his Excellency that      
I was entirely at his disposal, and accordingly we set out next             
morning.                                                                    
                                                    {P_3|CH_4 ^paragraph 10}
  During our journey he made me observe the several methods used by         
farmers in managing their lands, which to me were wholly                    
unaccountable; for except in some very few places I could not discover      
one ear of corn or blade of grass. But in three hours' traveling the        
scene was wholly altered; we came into a most beautiful country;            
farmers' houses at small distances, neatly built; the fields enclosed,      
containing vineyards, corn grounds, and meadows. Neither do I remember      
to have seen a more delightful prospect. His Excellency observed my         
countenance to clear up; he told me with a sigh that there his              
estate began, and would continue the same till we should come to his        
house. That his countrymen ridiculed and despised him for managing his      
affairs no better, and for setting so ill an example to the kingdom,        
which however was followed by very few, such as were old, and willful,      
and weak like himself.                                                      
  We came at length to the house, which was indeed a noble                  
structure, built according to the best rules of ancient                     
architecture. The fountains, gardens, walks, avenues, and groves            
were all disposed with exact judgment and taste. I gave due praises to      
every thing I saw, whereof his Excellency took not the least notice         
till after supper, when, there being no third companion, he told me         
with a very melancholy air that he doubted he must thrown down his          
houses in town and country, to rebuild them after the present mode,         
destroy all his plantations, and cast others into such a form as            
modern usage required, and give the same directions to all his              
tenants, unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride,              
singularity, affectation, ignorance, caprice, and perhaps increase his      
Majesty's displeasure.                                                      
  That the admiration I appeared to be under would cease or diminish        
when he had informed me of some particulars, which probably I never         
heard of at court, the people there being too much taken up in their        
own speculations, to have regard to what passed here below.                 
  The sum of his discourse was to this effect. That about forty             
years ago certain persons went up to Laputa, either upon business or        
diversion, and after five months continuance came back with a very          
little smattering in mathematics, but full of volatile spirits              
acquired in that airy region. That these persons upon their return          
began to dislike the management of every thing below, and fell into         
schemes of putting all arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics upon a      
new foot. To this end they procured a royal patent for erecting an          
Academy of Projectors in Lagado; and the humor prevailed so strongly        
among the people, that there is not a town of any consequence in the        
kingdom without such an academy. In these colleges the professors           
contrive new rules and methods of agriculture and building, and new         
instruments and tools for all trades and manufactures, whereby, as          
they undertake, one man shall do the work of ten; a palace may be           
built in a week, of materials so durable as to last forever without         
repairing. All the fruits of the earth shall come to maturity at            
whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a hundred fold         
more than they do at present, with innumerable other happy                  
proposals. The only inconvenience is, that none of these projects           
are yet brought to perfection, and in the meantime, the whole               
country lies miserably waste, the houses in ruins, and the people           
without food or clothes. By all which, instead of being discouraged,        
they are fifty times more violently bent upon prosecuting their             
schemes, driven equally on by hope and despair; that as for himself,        
being not of an enterprising spirit, he was content to go on in the         
old forms, to live in the houses his ancestors had built, and act as        
they did in every part of life without innovation. That some few other      
persons of quality and gentry had done the same, but were looked on         
with an eye of contempt and ill-will, as enemies to art, ignorant, and      
ill commonwealth's-men, preferring their own ease and sloth before the      
general improvement of their country.                                       
  His Lordship added that he would not by any further particulars           
prevent the pleasure I should certainly take in viewing the grand           
Academy, whither he was resolved I should go. He only desired me to         
observe a ruined building upon the side of a mountain about three           
miles distant, of which he gave me this account. That he had a very         
convenient mill within half a mile of his house, turned by a current        
from a large river, and sufficient for his own family as well as a          
great number of his tenants. That about seven years ago a club of           
those projectors came to him with proposals to destroy this mill,           
and build another on the side of that mountain, on the long ridge           
whereof a long canal must be cut for a repository of water, to be           
conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply the mill; because the            
wind and air upon a height agitated the water, and thereby made it          
fitter for motion; and because the water descending down a declivity        
would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose course is        
more upon a level. He said, that being then not very well with the          
court, and pressed by many of his friends, he complied with the             
proposal; and after employing an hundred men for two years, the work        
miscarried, the projectors went off, laying the blame entirely. upon        
him, railing at him ever since, and putting others upon the same            
experiment, with equal assurance of success, as well as equal               
disappointment.                                                             
                                                    {P_3|CH_4 ^paragraph 15}
  In a few days we came back to town, and his Excellency,                   
considering the bad character he had in the Academy, would not go with      
me himself, but recommended me to a friend of his to bear me company        
thither. My lord was pleased to represent me as a great admirer of          
projects, and a person of much curiosity and easy belief; which indeed      
was not without truth, for I had myself been a sort of projector in my      
younger days.                                                               
                                                                            
P_3|CH_5                                                                    
  CHAPTER V                                                                 
-                                                                           
  This Academy is not an entire single building, but a continuation of      
several houses on both sides of a street, which growing waste was           
purchased and applied to that use.                                          
  I was received very kindly by the Warden, and went for many days          
to the Academy. Every room has in it one or more projectors, and I          
believe I could not be in fewer than five hundred rooms.                    
  The first man I saw was of a meager aspect, with sooty hands and          
face, his hair and beard long, ragged and singed in several places.         
His clothes, shirt, and skin were all of the same color. He had been        
eight years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers,        
which were to be put into vials hermetically sealed, and let out to         
warm the air in raw inclement summers. He told me he did not doubt          
in eight years more he should be able to supply the Governor's gardens      
with sunshine at a reasonable rate; but he complained that his stock        
was low, and entreated me to give him something as an encouragement to      
ingenuity, especially since this had been a very dear season for            
cucumbers. I made him a small present, for my lord had furnished me         
with money on purpose, because he knew their practice of begging            
from all who go to see them.                                                
  I went into another chamber, but was ready to hasten back, being          
almost overcome with a horrible stink. My conductor pressed me              
forward, conjuring me in a whisper to give no offense, which would          
be highly resented, and therefore I dare not so much as stop my             
nose. The projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the        
Academy; his face and beard were of a pale yellow; his hands and            
clothes daubed over with filth. When I was presented to him, he gave        
me a close embrace (a compliment I could well have excused). His            
employment from his first coming into the Academy, was an operation to      
reduce human excrement to its original food, by separating the several      
parts, removing the tincture which it receives from the gall, making        
the odor exhale, and off the saliva. He had a weekly allowance from         
the society, of a vessel filled with human ordure about the size of         
a Bristol barrel.                                                           
  I saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder, who likewise         
showed me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of          
fire, which he intended to publish.                                         
                                                     {P_3|CH_5 ^paragraph 5}
  There was a most ingenious architect who had contrived a new              
method for building houses, by beginning at the roof, and working           
downwards to the foundation, which he justified to me by the like           
practice of those two prudent insects, the bee and the spider.              
  There was a man born blind, who had several apprentices in his own        
condition; their employment was to mix colors for painters, which           
their master taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling. It         
was indeed my misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in      
their lessons, and the professor himself happened to be generally           
mistaken; this artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole          
fraternity.                                                                 
  In another apartment I was highly pleased with a projector, who           
had found a device of ploughing the ground with hogs, to save the           
charges of plows, cattle, and labor. The method in this: in an acre of      
ground you bury, at six inches distance and eight deep, a quantity          
of acorns, dates, chestnuts, and other mast or vegetables whereof           
these animals are fondest; then you drive six hundred or more of            
them into the field, where in a few days they will root up the whole        
ground in search of their food, and make it fit for sowing, at the          
same time manuring it with their dung. It is true, upon experiment          
they found the charge and trouble very great, and they had little or        
no crop. However, it is not doubted that this invention may be capable      
of great improvement.                                                       
  I went into another room, where the walls and ceiling were all            
hung round with cobwebs, except a narrow passage for the artist to          
go in and out. At my entrance he called aloud to me not to disturb his      
webs. He lamented the fatal mistake the world had been so long in of        
using silk worms, while we had such plenty of domestic insects, who         
infinitely excelled the former, because they understood how to weave        
as well as spin. And he proposed farther that by employing spiders the      
charge of dyeing silks should be wholly saved, whereof I was fully          
convinced when he showed me a vast number of flies most beautifully         
colored, wherewith he fed his spiders, assuring us that the webs would      
take a tincture from them; and as he had them of all hues, he hoped to      
fit everybody's fancy, as soon as he could find proper food for the         
flies, of certain gums, oils, and other glutinous matter to give a          
strength and consistence to the threads.                                    
  There was an astronomer who had undertaken to place a sundial upon        
the great weathercock on the townhouse, by adjusting the annual and         
diurnal motions of the earth and sun, so as to answer and coincide          
with all accidental turnings by the wind.                                   
                                                    {P_3|CH_5 ^paragraph 10}
  I was complaining of a small fit of the colic, upon which my              
conductor led me into a room, where a great physician resided, who was      
famous for curing that disease by contrary operations from the same         
instrument. He had a large pair of bellows with a long slender              
muzzle of ivory. This he conveyed eight inches up the anus, and             
drawing in the wind, he affirmed he could make the guts as lank as a        
dried bladder. But when the disease was more stubborn and violent,          
he let in the muzzle While the bellows were full of wind, which he          
discharged into the body of the patient, then withdrew the                  
instrument to replenish it, clapping his thumb strongly against the         
orifice of the fundament; and this being repeated three or four times,      
the adventitious wind would rush out, bringing the noxious along            
with it (like water put into a pump), and the patient recover. I saw        
him try both experiments upon a dog, but could not discern any              
effect from the former. After the latter, the animal was ready to           
burst, and made so violent a discharge, as was very offensive to me         
and my companions. The dog died on the spot, and we left the doctor         
endeavoring to recover him by the same operation.                           
  I visited many other apartments, but shall not trouble my reader          
with all the curiosities I observed, being studious of brevity.             
  I had hitherto seen only one side of the Academy, the other being         
appropriated to the advancers of speculative learning, of which I           
shall say something when I have mentioned one illustrious person more,      
who is called among them the universal artist. He told us he had            
been thirty years employing his thoughts for the improvement of             
human life. He had two large rooms full of wonderful curiosities,           
and fifty men at work. Some were condensing air into a dry tangible         
substance, by extracting the nitre, and letting the aqueous or fluid        
particles percolate; others softening marbles for pillows and               
pin-cushions; others petrifying the hoofs of a living horse to              
preserve them from foundering. The artist himself was at that time          
busy upon two great designs; the first, to sow land with chaff,             
wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be contained, as he          
demonstrated by several experiments which I was not skillful enough to      
comprehend. The other was, by a certain composition of gums, minerals,      
and vegetables outwardly applied, to prevent the growth of wool upon        
two young lambs; and he hoped in a reasonable time to propagate the         
breed of naked sheep all over the kingdom.                                  
  We crossed a walk to the other part of the Academy, where, as I have      
already said, the projectors in speculative learning resided.               
  The first professor I saw was in a very large room, with forty            
pupils about him. After salutation, observing me to look earnestly          
upon a frame, which took up the greatest part of both the length and        
breadth of the room, he said perhaps I might wonder to see him              
employed in a project for improving speculative knowledge by practical      
and mechanical operations. But the world would soon be sensible of its      
usefulness, and he flattered himself that a more noble exalted thought      
never sprang in any other man's head. Everyone knew how laborious           
the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas by           
his contrivance the most ignorant person at a reasonable charge, and        
with a little bodily labor, may write books in philosophy, poetry,          
politics, law, mathematics, and theology, without the least assistance      
from genius or study. He then led me to the frame, about the sides          
whereof all his pupils stood in ranks. It was twenty feet square,           
placed in the middle of the room. The superficies was composed of           
several bits of wood, about the bigness of a die, but some larger than      
others. They were all linked together by slender wires. These bits          
of wood were covered on every square with paper pasted on them, and on      
these papers were written all the words of their language, in their         
several moods, tenses, and declensions, but without any order. The          
professor then desired me to observe, for he was going to set his           
engine at work. The pupils at his command took each of them hold of an      
iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the edges of the          
frame, and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition of the          
words was entirely changed. He then commanded thirty-six of the lads        
to read the several lines softly as they appeared upon the frame;           
and where they found three or four words together that might make part      
of a sentence, they dictated to the four remaining boys who were            
scribes. This work was repeated three or four times, and at every turn      
the engine was so contrived that the words shifted into new places, as      
the square bits of wood moved upside down.                                  
                                                    {P_3|CH_5 ^paragraph 15}
  Six hours a day the young students were employed in this labor,           
and the professor showed me several volumes in large folio already          
collected, of broken sentences, which he intended to piece together,        
and out of those rich materials to give the world a complete body of        
all arts and sciences; which however might be still improved, and much      
expedited, if the public would raise a fund for making and employing        
five hundred such frames in Lagado, and oblige the managers to              
contribute in common their several collections.                             
                           (SEE PLATE 5)                                    
  He assured me, that this invention had employed all his thoughts          
from his youth, that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his           
frame, and made the strictest computation of the general proportion         
there is in books between the numbers of particles, nouns, and              
verbs, and other parts of speech.                                           
  I made my humblest acknowledgement to this illustrious person for         
his great communicativeness, and promised if ever I had the good            
fortune to return to my native country, that I would do him justice,        
as the sole inventor of this wonderful machine; the form and                
contrivance of which I desired leave to delineate upon paper, as in         
the figure here annexed. I told him, although it were the custom of         
our learned in Europe to steal inventions from each other, who had          
thereby at least this advantage, that it became a controversy which         
was the right owner, yet I would take such caution, that he should          
have the honor entire without a rival.                                      
  We next went to the school of languages, where three professors           
sat in consultation upon improving that of their own country.               
                                                    {P_3|CH_5 ^paragraph 20}
  The first project was to shorten discourse by cutting                     
polysyllables into one, and leaving out verbs and participles, because      
in reality all things imaginable are but nouns.                             
  The other project was a scheme for entirely abolishing all words          
whatsoever; and this was urged as a great advantage in point of health      
as well as brevity. For it is plain that every word we speak is in          
some degree a diminution of our lungs by corrosion, and consequently        
contributes to the shortening of our lives. An expedient was therefore      
offered, that since words are only names for things, it would be            
more convenient for all men to carry about them such things as were         
necessary to express the particular business they are to discourse on.      
And this invention would certainly have taken place, to the great ease      
as well as health of the subject, if the women, in conjunction with         
the vulgar and illiterate, had not threatened to raise a rebellion,         
unless they might be allowed the liberty to speak with their                
tongues, after the manner of their ancestors; such constant                 
irreconcilable enemies to science are the common people. However, many      
of the most learned and wise adhere to the new scheme of expressing         
themselves by things, which has only this inconvenience attending           
it, that if a man's business be very great, and of various kinds, he        
must be obliged in proportion to carry a greater bundle of things upon      
his back, unless he can afford one or two strong servants to attend         
him. I have often beheld two of those sages almost sinking under the        
weight of their packs, like pedlars among us; who, when they met in         
the streets, would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and hold         
conversation for an hour together; then put up their implements,            
help each other to resume their burdens, and take their leave.              
  But for short conversations a man may carry implements in his             
pockets and under his arms, enough to supply him, and in his house          
he cannot be at a loss. Therefore the room where company meet who           
practise this art, is full of all things ready at hand, requisite to        
furnish matter for this kind of artificial converse.                        
  Another great advantage proposed by this invention was that it would      
serve as a universal language to be understood in all civilized             
nations, whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind, or        
nearly resembling, so that their uses might easily be comprehended.         
And thus ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign               
princes or ministers of state, to whose tongues they were utter             
strangers.                                                                  
  I was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his pupils      
after a method scarce imaginable to us in Europe. The proposition           
and demonstration were fairly written on a thin wafer, with ink             
composed of a cephalic tincture. This the student was to swallow            
upon a fasting stomach, and for three days following eat nothing but        
bread and water. As the wafer digested, the tincture mounted to his         
brain, bearing the proposition along with it. But the success has           
not hitherto been answerable, partly by some error in the quantum or        
composition, and partly by the perverseness of lads, to whom this           
bolus is so nauseous, that they generally steal aside, and discharge        
it upwards before it can operate; neither have they been yet persuaded      
to use so long an abstinence as the prescription required.                  
                                                                            
P_3|CH_6                                                                    
  CHAPTER VI                                                                
-                                                                           
  In the school of political projectors I was but ill entertained, the      
professors appearing in my judgment wholly out of their senses,             
which is a scene that never fails to make me melancholy. These unhappy      
people were proposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose             
favorites upon the score of their wisdom, capacity, and virtue; of          
teaching ministers to consult the public good; of rewarding merit,          
great abilities, eminent services; of instructing princes to know           
their true interest by placing it on the same foundation with that          
of their people; of choosing for employments persons qualified to           
exercise them; with many other wild impossible chimeras, that never         
entered before into the heart of man to conceive, and confirmed in          
me the old observation, that there is nothing so extravagant and            
irrational which some philosophers have not maintained for truth.           
  But however I shall so far do justice to this part of the Academy,        
as to acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary. There was         
a most ingenious doctor who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole      
nature and system of government. This illustrious person had very           
usefully employed his studies in finding out effectual remedies for         
all diseases and corruptions, to which the several kinds of public          
administration are subject by the vices or infirmities of those who         
govern, as well as by the licentiousness of those who are to obey. For      
instance, whereas all writers and reasoners have agreed, that there is      
a strict universal resemblance between the natural and the political        
body; can there be anything more evident, than that the health of both      
must be preserved, and the cured by the same prescriptions? It is           
allowed that senates and great councils are often troubled with             
redundant, ebullient, and other peccant humors, with many diseases          
of the head, and more of the heart; with strong convulsions, with           
grievous contractions of the nerves and sinews in both hands, but           
especially the right; with spleen, flatus, vertigos, and deliriums;         
with scrofulous tumors full of fetid purulent matter; with sour frothy      
ructations, with canine appetites and crudeness of digestion,               
besides many others needless to mention. This doctor therefore              
proposed, that upon the meeting of a senate, certain physicians should      
attend at the three first days of their sitting, and at the close of        
each day's debate, feel the pulses of every senator; after which,           
having maturely considered, and consulted upon the nature of the            
several maladies, and the methods of cure, they should on the fourth        
day return to the senate house, attended by their apothecaries              
stored with proper medicines; and before the members sat, administer        
to each of them lenitives, aperitives, abstersives, corrosives,             
restringents, palliatives, laxatives, cephalalgics, icterics,               
apophlegmatics, acoustics, as their several cases required; and             
according as these medicines should operate, repeat, alter, or omit         
them at the next meeting.                                                   
  This project could not be of any great expense to the public, and         
would, in my poor opinion, be of much use for the dispatch of business      
in those countries where senates have any share in the legislative          
power; beget unanimity, shorten debates, open a few mouths which are        
now closed, and close many more which are now open; curb the petulancy      
of the young, and correct the positiveness of the old; rouse the            
stupid, and damp the pert.                                                  
  Again, because it is a general complaint, that the favorites of           
princes are troubled with short and weak memories, the same doctor          
proposed, that whoever attended a first minister, after having told         
his business with the utmost brevity and in the plainest words, should      
at his departure give the said minister a tweak by the nose, or a kick      
in the belly, or tread on his corns, or lug him thrice by both ears,        
or pin into his breech, or pinch his arm black and blue, to prevent         
forgetfulness; and at every levee day repeat the same operation,            
till the business were done or absolutely refused.                          
  He likewise directed, that every senator in the great council of a        
nation, after he had delivered his opinion, and argued in the               
defense of it, should be obliged to give his vote directly contrary;        
because if that were done, the result would infallibly terminate in         
the good of the public.                                                     
                                                     {P_3|CH_6 ^paragraph 5}
  When parties in a state are violent, he offered a wonderful               
contrivance to reconcile them. The method is this. You take a               
hundred leaders of each party, you dispose them into couples of such        
whose heads are nearest of a size; then let two nice operators saw off      
the occiput of each couple at the same time, in such a manner that the      
brain may be equally divided. Let the occiputs thus cut off be              
interchanged, applying each to the head of his opposite party-man.          
It seems indeed to be a work that requires some exactness, but the          
professor assured us that if it were dexterously performed the cure         
would be infallible. For he argued thus; that the two half brains           
being left to debate the matter between themselves within the space of      
one skull, would soon come to a good understanding, and produce that        
moderation, as well as regularity of thinking, so much to be wished         
for in the heads of those who imagine they come into the world only to      
watch and govern its motion: and as to the difference of brains in          
quantity or quality among those who are directors in faction, the           
doctor assured us from his own knowledge that it was a perfect trifle.      
  I heard a very warm debate between two professors, about the most         
commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money without            
grieving the subject. The first affirmed the most just method would be      
to lay a certain tax upon vices and folly, and the sum fixed upon           
every man to be rated after the fairest manner by a jury of his             
neighbors. The second was of an opinion directly contrary, to tax           
those qualities of body and mind for which men chiefly value                
themselves, the rate to be more or less according to the degrees of         
excelling, the decision whereof should be left entirely to their own        
breast. The highest tax was upon men who are the greatest favorites of      
the other sex, and the assessments according to the number and natures      
of the favors they have received; for which they are allowed to be          
their own vouchers. Wit, valor, and politeness were likewise                
proposed to be largely taxed, and collected in the same manner, by          
every person's giving his own word for the quantum of what he               
possessed. But as to honor, justice, wisdom, and learning, they should      
not be taxed at all, because they are qualifications of so singular         
a kind, that no man will either allow them in his neighbor, or value        
them in himself.                                                            
  The women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and         
skill in dressing, wherein they had the same privilege with the men,        
to be determined by their own judgment. But constancy, chastity,            
good sense, and good nature were not rated, because they would not          
bear the charge of collecting.                                              
  To keep senators in the interest of the crown, it was proposed            
that the members should raffle for employments, every man first taking      
an oath, and giving security that he would vote for the court, whether      
he won or not; after which the losers had in their turn the liberty of      
raising upon the next vacancy. Thus hope and expectation would be kept      
alive, none would complain of broken promises, but impute their             
disappointments wholly to fortune, whose shoulders are broader and          
stronger than those of a ministry.                                          
  Another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for             
discovering plots and conspiracies against the government. He               
advised great statesmen to examine into the diet of all suspected           
persons; their times of eating; upon which side they lay in bed;            
with which hand they wiped their posteriors; to take a strict view          
of their excrements, and, from the color, the odor, the taste, the          
consistence, the crudeness of maturity of digestion, form a judgment        
of their thoughts and designs. Because men are never so serious,            
thoughtful, and intent, as when they are at stool, which he found by        
frequent experiment; for in such conjunctures, when he used merely          
as a trial to consider which was the best way of murdering the king,        
his ordure would have a tincture of green, but quite different when he      
thought only of raising an insurrection or burning the metropolis.          
                                                    {P_3|CH_6 ^paragraph 10}
  The whole discourse was written with great acuteness, containing          
many observations both curious and useful for politicians, but as I         
conceived not altogether complete. This I ventured to tell the author,      
and offered if he pleased to supply him with some additions. He             
received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among            
writers, especially those of the projecting species, professing he          
would be glad to receive further information.                               
  I told him that in the kingdom of Tribnia, by the natives called          
Langden, where I had sojourned some time in my travels, the bulk of         
the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers, witnesses,            
informers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers, together with        
their several subservient and subaltern instruments, all under the          
colors and conduct of ministers of state and their deputies. The plots      
in that kingdom are usually the workmanship of those persons who            
desire to raise their own characters of profound politicians, to            
restore new vigor to a crazy administration, to stifle or divert            
general discontents, to fill their pockets with forfeitures, and raise      
or sink the opinion of public credit, as either shall best answer           
their private advantage. It is first agreed and settled among them,         
what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot; then, effectual          
care is taken to secure all their letters and papers, and put the           
criminals in chains. These papers are delivered to a set of artists,        
very dexterous in finding out the mysterious meanings of words,             
syllables, and letters. For instance, they can discover a                   
close-stool to signify a privy council; a flock of geese, a senate;         
a lame dog, an invader; a codshead, a ---; the plague, a standing           
army; a buzzard, a prime minister; the gout, a high priest; a               
gibbet, a secretary of state; a chamber-pot, a committee of                 
grandees; a sieve, a court lady; a broom, a revolution; a mousetrap,        
an employment; a bottomless pit, the treasury; a sink, the court; a         
cap-and bells, a favorite; a broken reed, a court of justice; an empty      
tun, a general; a running sore, the administration.                         
  When this method fails, they have two others more effectual, which        
the learned among them call acrostics and anagrams. First they can          
decipher all initial letters into political meanings. Thus, N. shall        
signify a plot; B. a regiment of horse; L. a fleet at sea; or secondly      
by transposing the letters of the alphabet in any suspected paper,          
they can discover the deepest designs of a discontented party. So           
for example if I should say in a letter to a friend, Our brother Tom        
has just got the piles, a skillful decipherer would discover that           
the same letters which compose that sentence may be analyzed into           
the following words: Resist -- a plot is brought home -- the tour. And      
this is the anagrammatic method.                                            
  The professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating             
these observations, and promised to make honorable mention of me in         
his treatise.                                                               
  I saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer            
continuance, and began to think of returning home to England.               
                                                                            
P_3|CH_7                                                                    
  CHAPTER VII                                                               
-                                                                           
  The continent of which this kingdom is a part extends itself, as I        
have reason to believe, eastward to that unknown tract of America,          
westward to California, and north to the Pacific Ocean, which is not        
above a hundred and fifty miles from Lagado, where there is a good          
port and much commerce with the great island of Luggnagg, situated          
to the northwest about 29 degrees north latitude, and 140 longitude.        
The island of Luggnagg stands southeastward of Japan, about a               
hundred leagues distant. There is a strict alliance between the             
Japanese Emperor and the King of Luggnagg, which affords frequent           
opportunities of sailing from one island to the other. I determined         
therefore to direct my course this way, in order to my return to            
Europe. I hired two mules with a guide to show me the way, and carry        
my small baggage. I took leave of my noble protector, who had shown me      
so much favor and made me a generous present at my departure.               
  My journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating.          
When I arrived at the port of Maldonada (for so it is called) there         
was no ship in the harbor bound for Luggnagg, nor likely to be in some      
time. The town is about as large as Portsmouth. I soon fell into            
some acquaintance, and was very hospitably received. A gentleman of         
distinction said to me that since the ships bound for Luggnagg could        
not be ready in less than a month, it might be no disagreeable              
amusement for me to take a trip to the little island of                     
Glubbdubdrib, about five leagues off to the southwest. He offered           
himself and a friend to accompany me, and that I should be provided         
with a small convenient barque for the voyage.                              
  Glubbdubdrib, as nearly as I can interpret the word, signifies the        
Island of Sorcerers or Magicians. It is about one-third as large as         
the Isle of Wight, and extremely fruitful; it is governed by the            
head of a certain tribe, who are all magicians. This tribe marries          
only among each other, and the eldest in succession is Prince or            
Governor. He has a noble palace, and a park of about three thousand         
acres, surrounded by a wall of hewn stone twenty feet high. In this         
park are several small enclosures for cattle, corn, and gardening.          
  The Governor and his family are served and attended by domestics          
of a kind somewhat unusual. By his skill in necromancy, he has a power      
of calling whom he pleases from the dead, and commanding their service      
for twenty-four hours, but no longer; nor can he call the same persons      
up again in less than three months, except upon very extraordinary          
occasions.                                                                  
  When we arrived at the island, which was about eleven in the              
morning, one of the gentlemen who accompanied me, went to the               
Governor, and desired admittance for a stranger, who came on purpose        
to have the honor of attending on his Highness. This was immediately        
granted, and we all three entered the gate of the palace between two        
rows of guards, armed and dressed after a very antic manner, and            
something in their countenances that made my flesh creep a horror I         
cannot express. We passed through several apartments, between servants      
of the same sort, ranked on each side as before, till we came to the        
chamber of presence, where after three profound obeisances, and a           
few general questions, we were permitted to sit on three stools near        
the lowest step of his Highness's throne. He understood the language        
of Balnibarbi, although it were different from that of his island.          
He desired me to give him some account of my travels; and to let me         
see that I should be treated without ceremony, he dismissed all his         
attendants with a turn of his finger, at which to my great                  
astonishment they vanished in an instant, like visions in a dream,          
when we awake on a sudden. I could not recover myself in some time,         
till the Governor assured me that I should receive no hurt; and             
observing my two companions to be under no concern, who had been often      
entertained in the same manner, I began to take courage, and related        
to his Highness a short history of my several adventures, yet not           
without some hesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the place      
where I had seen those domestic specters. I had the honor to dine with      
the Governor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited      
at table. I now observed myself to be less terrified than I had been        
in the morning. I stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his                
Highness to excuse me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in        
the palace. My two friends and I lay at a private house in the town         
adjoining, which is the capital of this little island; and the next         
morning we returned to pay our duty to the Governor, as he was pleased      
to command us.                                                              
                                                     {P_3|CH_7 ^paragraph 5}
  After this manner we continued in the island for ten days, most part      
of every day with the Governor, and at night in our lodging. I soon         
grew so familiarized to the sight of spirits, that the third or fourth      
time they gave me no emotion at all; or if I had any apprehensions          
left, my curiosity prevailed over them. For his Highness the                
Governor ordered me to call up whatever persons I would choose to           
name, and in whatever numbers among all the dead from the beginning of      
the world to the present time, and command them to answer any               
questions I should think fit to ask; with this condition, that my           
questions must be confined within the compass of the times they             
lived in. And one thing I might depend upon, that they would certainly      
tell me truth, for lying was a talent of no use in the lower world.         
  I made my humble acknowledgments to his Highness for so great a           
favor. We were in a chamber from whence there was a fair prospect into      
the park. And because my first inclination was to be entertained            
with scenes of pomp and magnificence, I desired to see Alexander the        
Great, at the head of his army just after the battle of Arbela;             
which upon a notion of the Governor's finger immediately appeared in a      
large field under the window where we stood. Alexander was called up        
into the room; it was with great difficulty that I understood his           
Greek, and had but little of my own. He assured me upon his honor that      
he was not poisoned, but died of a fever by excessive drinking.             
  Next I saw Hannibal passing the Alps, who told me he had not a            
drop of vinegar in his camp.                                                
  I saw Caesar and Pompey at the head of their troops, just ready to        
engage. I saw the former in his last great triumph. I desired that the      
senate of Rome might appear before me in one large chamber, and an          
assembly of somewhat a latter age in counterview in another. The first      
seemed to be an assembly of heroes and demigods; the other a knot of        
pedlars, pickpockets, highway-men, and bullies.                             
  The Governor at my request gave the sign for Caesar and Brutus to         
advance towards us. I was struck with a profound veneration at the          
sight of Brutus, and could easily discover the most consummate virtue,      
the greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind, the truest love of           
his country, and general benevolence for mankind in every lineament of      
his countenance. I observed with much pleasure that these two               
persons were in good intelligence with each other, and Caesar freely        
confessed to me that the greatest actions of his own life were not          
equal by many degrees to the glory of taking it away. I had the             
honor to have much conversation with Brutus; and was told, that his         
ancestor Junius, Socrates, Epaminondas, Cato the younger, Sir Thomas        
More, and himself were perpetually together: a sextumvirate to which        
all the ages of the world cannot add a seventh.                             
                                                    {P_3|CH_7 ^paragraph 10}
  It would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast         
numbers of illustrious persons were called up, to gratify that              
insatiable desire I had to see the world in every period of                 
antiquity placed before me. I chiefly fed my eyes with beholding the        
destroyers of tyrants and usurpers, and the restorers of liberty to         
oppressed and injured nations. But it is impossible to express the          
satisfaction I received in my own mind, after such a manner as to make      
it a suitable entertainment to the reader.                                  
                                                                            
P_3|CH_8                                                                    
  CHAPTER VIII                                                              
-                                                                           
  Having a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit      
and learning, I set apart one day on purpose. I proposed that Homer         
and Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators;           
but these were so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in      
the court and outward rooms of the palace. I knew and could                 
distinguish those two heroes at first sight, not only from the crowd        
but from each other. Homer was the taller and comelier person of the        
two, walked very erect for one of his age, and his eyes were the            
most quick and piercing I ever beheld. Aristotle stooped much, and          
made use of a staff. His visage was meager, his hair lank and thin,         
and his voice hollow. I soon discovered that both of were perfect           
strangers to the rest of the company, and had never seen or heard of        
them before. And I had a whisper from a ghost, who shall be                 
nameless, that these commentators always kept in the most distant           
quarters from their principals in the lower world, through a                
consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly              
misrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity. I introduced      
Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them         
better than perhaps they deserved; for he soon found they wanted a          
genius to enter into the spirit of a poet. But Aristotle was out of         
all patience with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I          
presented them to him; and he asked them whether the rest of the tribe      
were as great dunces as themselves.                                         
  I then desired the Governor to call up Descartes and Gassendi,            
with whom I prevailed to explain their systems to Aristotle. This           
great philosopher freely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural           
philosophy, because he proceeded in many things upon conjecture, as         
all men must do; and he found, that Gassendi, who had made the              
doctrine of Epicurus as palatable as he could, and the vortices of          
Descartes, were equally exploded. He predicted the same fate to             
attraction, whereof the present learned are such zealous asserters. He      
said that new systems of nature were but new fashions, which would          
vary in every age; and even those who pretend to demonstrate them from      
mathematical principles, would flourish but a short period of time,         
and be out of vogue when that was determined.                               
  I spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient           
learned. I saw most of the first Roman emperors. I prevailed on the         
Governor to call up Eliogabalus's cooks to dress us a dinner, but they      
could not show us much of their skill, for want of materials. A             
helot of Agesilaus made us a dish of Spartan broth, but I was not able      
to get down a second spoonful.                                              
  The two gentlemen who conducted me to the island were pressed by          
their private affairs to return in three days, which I employed in          
seeing some of the modern dead, who had made the greatest figure for        
two or three hundred years past in our own and other countries of           
Europe; and having been always a great admirer of old illustrious           
families, I desired the Governor call up a dozen or two of kings            
with their ancestors in order for eight or nine generations. But my         
disappointment was grevious and unexpected. For instead of a long           
train with royal diadems, I saw in one family two fiddlers, three           
spruce courtiers, and an Italian prelate. In another, a barber, an          
abbot, and two cardinals. I have too great a veneration for crowned         
heads to dwell any longer on so nice a subject. But as to counts,           
marquesses, dukes, earls, and the like, I was not so scrupulous. And I      
confess it was not without some pleasure that I found myself able to        
trace the particular features, by which certain families are                
distinguished, up to their originals. I could plainly discover from         
whence one family derives a long chin, why a second has abounded            
with knaves for two generations, and fools for two more; why a third        
happened to be crack-brained, and a fourth to be sharpers. Whence it        
came what Polydore Virgil says of a certain great house, Nec vir            
fortis, nec femina casta. How cruelty, falsehood, and cowardice grew        
to be characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as        
much as by their coat of arms. Who first brought the pox into a             
noble house, which has lineally descended in scrofulous tumors to           
their posterity. Neither could I wonder at all this, when I saw such        
an interruption of lineages by pages, lackeys, valets, coachmen,            
gamesters, captains and pickpockets.                                        
  I was chiefly disgusted with modern history. For having strictly          
examined all the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes for      
a hundred years past, I found how the world had been misled by              
prostitute writers, to ascribe the greatest exploits in war to              
cowards, the wisest counsel to fools, sincerity to flatterers, Roman        
virtue to betrayers of their country, piety to atheists, chastity to        
sodomites, informers. How many innocent and excellent persons had been      
condemned to death or banishment, by the practising of great ministers      
upon the corruption of judges, and the malice of factions. How many         
villains had been exalted to the highest places of trust, power,            
dignity, and profit: how great a share in the motions and events of         
courts, councils, and senates might be challenged by bawds, whores,         
pimps, parasites, and buffoons. How low an opinion I had of human           
wisdom and integrity, when I was truly informed of the springs and          
motives of great enterprises and revolutions in the world, and of           
the contemptible accidents to which they owed their success.                
                                                     {P_3|CH_8 ^paragraph 5}
  Here I discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend          
to write anecdotes, or secret history, who send so many kings to their      
graves with a cup of poison; will repeat the discourse between a            
prince and chief minister, where no witness was by; unlock the              
thoughts and cabinets of ambassadors and secretaries of state, and          
have the perpetual misfortune to be mistaken. Here I discovered the         
secret causes of many great events that have surprised the world,           
how a whore can govern the backstairs, the backstairs a council, and        
the council a senate. A general confessed in my presence, that he           
got a victory purely by the force of cowardice and ill conduct; and an      
admiral, that for want of proper intelligence, he beat the enemy to         
whom he intended to betray the fleet. Three kings protested to me,          
that in their whole reigns they never did once prefer any person of         
merit, unless by mistake or treachery of some minister in whom they         
confided; neither would they do it if they were to live again; and          
they showed with great strength of reason that the royal throne             
could not be supported without corruption, because that positive,           
confident, restive temper, which virtue infused into man, was a             
perpetual clog to public business.                                          
  I had the curiosity to enquire in a particular manner, by what            
method great numbers had procured to themselves high titles of              
honor, and prodigious estates; and I confined my inquiry to a very          
modern period; however, without grating upon present times, because         
I would be sure to give no offense even to foreigners (for I hope           
the reader need not be told that I do not in the least intend my own        
country in what I say upon this occasion), a great number of persons        
concerned were called up, and upon a very slight examination,               
discovered such a scene of infamy, that I cannot reflect upon it            
without some seriousness. Perjury, oppression, subornation, fraud,          
panderism, and the like infirmities, were amongst the most excusable        
arts they had to mention, and for these I gave, as it was                   
reasonable, great allowance. But when some confessed they owed their        
greatness and wealth to sodomy or incest, others to the prostituting        
of their own wives and daughters; others to the betraying of their          
country or their prince; some to poisoning, more to the perverting          
of justice in order to destroy the innocent; I hope I may be                
pardoned if these discoveries inclined me little to abate of that           
profound veneration which I am naturally apt to pay to persons of high      
rank, who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their          
sublime dignity, by us their inferiors.                                     
  I had often read of some great services done to princes and               
states, and desired to see the persons by whom those services were          
performed. Upon inquiry I was told that their names were to be found        
on no record, except a few of them whom history has represented as the      
vilest rogues and traitors. As to the rest, I had never once heard          
of them. They all appeared with dejected looks, and in the meanest          
habit, most of them telling me they died in poverty and disgrace,           
and the rest on a scaffold or a gibbet.                                     
  Among the rest there was one person whose case appeared a little          
singular. He had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his           
side. He told me he had for many years been commander of a ship, and        
in the sea fight of Actium had the good fortune to break through the        
enemy's great line of battle, sink three of their capital ships, and        
take a fourth, which was the sole cause of Antony's flight, and of the      
victory that ensued; that the youth standing by him, his only son, was      
killed in action. He added that upon the confidence of some merit, the      
war being at an end, he went to Rome, and solicited at the court of         
Augustus to be preferred to a greater ship, whose commander had been        
killed; but without any regard to his pretensions, it was given to a        
youth who had never seen the sea, the son of Libertine, who waited          
on one of the emperor's mistresses. Returning back to his own               
vessel, he was charged with neglect of duty, and the ship given to a        
favorite page of Publicola, the vice-admiral; whereupon he retired          
to a poor farm at a great distance from Rome, and there ended his           
life. I was so curious to know the truth of this story, that I desired      
Agrippa might be called, who was admiral in that fight. He appeared,        
and confirmed the whole account, but with much more advantage to the        
captain, whose modesty had extenuated or concealed a great part of his      
merit.                                                                      
  I was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in          
that empire, by the force of luxury so lately introduced, which made        
me less wonder at many parallel cases in other countries, where             
vices of all kinds have reigned so much longer, and where the whole         
praise as well as pillage has been engrossed by the chief commander,        
who perhaps had the least title to either.                                  
                                                    {P_3|CH_8 ^paragraph 10}
  As every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had         
done in the world, it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how         
much the race of human kind was degenerate among us, within these           
hundred years past. How the pox under all its consequences and              
denominations had altered every lineament of an English countenance,        
shortened the size of bodies, unbraced the nerves, relaxed the              
sinews and muscles, introduced a sallow complexion, and rendered the        
flesh loose and rancid.                                                     
  I descended so low as to desire that some English yeomen of the           
old stamp might be summoned to appear, once so famous for the               
simplicity of their manners, diet and dress, for justice in their           
dealings, for their true spirit of liberty, for their valor and love        
of their country. Neither could I be wholly unmoved after comparing         
the living with the dead, when I considered how all these pure              
native virtues were prostituted for a piece of money by their               
grandchildren, who in selling their votes, and managing at                  
elections, have acquired every vice and corruption that can possibly        
be learned in a court.                                                      
                                                                            
P_3|CH_9                                                                    
  CHAPTER IX                                                                
-                                                                           
  The day of our departure being come, I took leave of his Highness         
the Governor of Glubbdubdrib, and returned with my two companions to        
Maldonada, where after a fortnight's waiting, a ship was ready to sail      
for Luggnagg. The two gentlemen, and some others, were so generous and      
kind as to furnish me with provisions, and see me on board. I was a         
month in this voyage. We had one violent storm and were under a             
necessity of steering westward to get into the tradewind, which             
holds for above sixty leagues. On the 21st of April, 1709, we sailed        
into the river of Clumegnig, which is a seaport town, at the southeast      
point of Luggnagg. We cast anchor within a league of the town, and          
made a signal for a pilot. Two of them came on board in less than half      
an hour, by whom we were guided between certain shoals and rocks,           
which are very dangerous in the passage, to a large basin, where fleet      
may ride in safety within a cable's length of the town wall.                
  Some of our sailors, whether out of treachery or inadvertence, had        
informed the pilots that I was a stranger and a traveler, whereof           
these gave notice to a custom house officer, by whom I was examined         
very strictly upon my landing. This officer spoke to me in the              
language of Balnibarbi, which by the force of much commerce is              
generally understood in that town, especially by seamen, and those          
employed in the customs. I gave him a short account of some                 
particulars, and made my story as plausible and consistent as I             
could; but I thought it necessary to disguise my country, and call          
myself an Hollander, because my intentions were for Japan, and I knew       
the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted to enter into that              
kingdom. I therefore told the officer, that having been shipwrecked         
on the coast of Balnibarbi, and cast on a rock, I was received up           
into Laputa, or the Flying Island (of which he had often heard), and        
was now endeavoring to get to Japan, from whence I might find a             
convenience of returning to my own country. The officer said I must         
be confined till he could receive orders from court, for which he           
would write immediately, and hoped to receive an answer in a                
fortnight. I was carried to a convenient lodging, with a sentry             
placed at the door; however I had the liberty of a large garden, and        
was treated with humanity enough, being maintained all the time at          
the King's charge. I was visited by several persons, chiefly out of         
curiosity, because it was reported that I came from countries very          
remote of which they had never heard.                                       
  I hired a young man who came in the same ship to be an                    
interpreter; he was a native of Luggnagg, but had lived some years          
at Maldonada, and was a perfect master of both languages. By his            
assistance I was able to hold a conversation with those who came to         
visit me; but this consisted only of their questions, and my answers.       
  The dispatch came from court about the time we expected. It               
contained a warrant for conducting me and my retinue to Traldragdubb        
or Trildrogdrib, for it is pronounced both ways as near as I can            
remember, by a party of ten horse. All my retinue was that poor lad         
for an interpreter, whom I persuaded into my service, and at my humble      
request, we had each of us a mule to ride on. A messenger was               
dispatched half a day's journey before us, to give the King notice          
of my approach, and to desire that his Majesty would please appoint         
a day and hour, when it would be his gracious pleasure that I might         
have the honor to lick the dust before his footstool. This is the           
court style, and I found it to be more than matter of form. For upon        
my admittance two days after my arrival, I was commanded to crawl on        
my belly, and lick the floor as I advanced; but on account of my being      
a stranger, care was taken to have it made so clean that the dust           
was not offensive. However, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed          
to any but persons of the highest rank, when they desire an                 
admittance. Nay, sometimes the floor is strewn with dust on purpose,        
when the person to be admitted happens to have powerful enemies at          
court. And I have seen a great lord with his mouth so crammed, that         
when he had crept to the proper distance from the throne, he was not        
able to speak a word. Neither is there any remedy, because it is            
capital for those who receive an audience to spit or wipe their mouths      
in his Majesty's presence. There is indeed another custom, which I          
cannot altogether approve of. When the king has a mind to put any of        
his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands to            
have the floor strewn with a certain brown powder, of a deadly              
composition, which being licked up infallibly kills him in twenty-four      
hours. But in justice to this prince's great clemency, and the care he      
has of his subject's lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the      
monarchs of Europe would imitate him), it must be mentioned for his         
honor, that strict orders are given to have the infected parts of           
the floor well after every such execution; which if his domestics           
neglect, they are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure. I           
myself heard him give directions, that one of his pages should be           
whipped, whose turn it was to give notice about washing the floor           
after an execution, but maliciously had omitted it; by which neglect a      
young lord of great hopes coming to an audience, was unfortunately          
poisoned, although the King at that time had not design against his         
life. But this good prince was so gracious as to forgive the poor page      
his whipping, upon promise that he would do so no more, without             
special orders.                                                             
  To return from this digression; when I had crept within four yards        
of the throne, I raised myself gently upon my knees, and then striking      
my forehead seven times on the ground, I pronounced the following           
words, as they had been taught me the night before, Ickpling                
gloffthrobb squutserumm blhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkguffh                 
slhiophad gurdlubh asht. This is the compliment established by the          
laws of the land for all persons admitted to the King's presence. It        
may be rendered into English thus: May your Celestial Majesty               
outlive the sun, eleven moons and a half. To this the King returned         
some answer, which although I could not understand, yet I replied as I      
had been directed: Fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush, which      
properly signifies, My tongue is in the mouth of my friend, and by          
this expression was meant that I desired leave to bring my                  
interpreter; whereupon the young man already mentioned was accordingly      
introduced, by whose intervention I answered as many questions as           
his Majesty could put in over an hour. I spoke in the Balnibarbian          
tongue, and my interpreter delivered my meaning in that of Luggnagg.        
                                                     {P_3|CH_9 ^paragraph 5}
  The King was much delighted with my company, and ordered his              
Bliffmarklub or High Chamberlain, to appoint a lodging in the court         
for me and my interpreter, with a daily allowance for my table, and         
a large purse of gold for my common expenses.                               
  I stayed three months in this country out of perfect obedience to         
his Majesty, who was pleased highly to favor me, and made me very           
honorable offers. But I thought it more consistent with prudence and        
justice to pass the remainder of my days with my wife and family.           
                                                                            
P_3|CH_10                                                                   
  CHAPTER X                                                                 
-                                                                           
  The Luggnaggians are a polite and generous people, and although they      
are not without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all           
Eastern countries, yet they show themselves courteous to strangers,         
especially such who are countenanced by the court. I had many               
acquaintance among persons of the best fashion, and being always            
attended by my interpreter, the conversation we had was not                 
disagreeable.                                                               
  One day in much good company I was asked by a person of quality,          
whether I had seen any of their Struldbrugs, or Immortals. I said I         
had not, and desired he would explain to me what he meant by such an        
appellation applied to a mortal creature. He told me, that                  
sometimes, though very rarely, a child happened to be born in a family      
with a red circular spot in the forehead, directly over the left            
eyebrow, which was an infallible mark that it should never die. The         
spot, as he described it, was about the compass of a silver                 
threepence, but in the course of time grew larger, and changed its          
color; for at twelve years old it became green, so continued till           
twenty-five, then turned to a deep blue; at forty-five it grew coal         
black, and as large as an English shilling, but never admitted any          
further alteration. He said these births were so rare, that he did not      
believe there could be above eleven hundred struldbrugs of both             
sexes in the whole kingdom, of which he computed about fifty in the         
metropolis, and among the rest a young girl born about three years          
ago. That these productions were not peculiar to any family, but a          
mere effect of chance; and the children of the struldbrugs                  
themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the people.                 
  I freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight        
upon hearing this account, and the person who gave it me happening          
to understand the Balnibarbian language, which I spoke very well, I         
could not forbear breaking out into expressions perhaps a little too        
extravagant. I cried out as in a rapture: Happy nation where every          
child hath at least a chance for being immortal! Happy people who           
enjoy so many living examples of ancient virtue, and have masters           
ready to instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages! but, happiest      
beyond all comparison are those excellent struldbrugs, who being            
born exempt from that universal calamity of human nature, have their        
minds free and disengaged, without the weight and depression of             
spirits caused by the continual apprehension of death. I discovered my      
admiration that I had not observed any of these illustrious persons at      
court; the black spot on the forehead being so remarkable a                 
distinction, that I could not have easily overlooked and it was             
impossible that his Majesty, a most judicious prince, should not            
provide himself with a good number of such wise and able counselors.        
Yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend sages was too strict for           
the corrupt and libertine manners of a court. And we often find by          
experience that young men are too opinionative and volatile to be           
guided by the sober dictates of their seniors. However, since the King      
was pleased to allow me access to his royal person, I was resolved          
upon the very first occasion to deliver my opinion to him on this           
matter freely and at large, by the help of my interpreter; and whether      
he would please to take my advice or not, yet in one thing I was            
determined, that his Majesty having frequently offered me an                
establishment in this country, I would with great thankfulness              
accept the favor, and pass my life here in the conversation of those        
superior beings the struldbrugs, if they would please to admit me.          
  The gentleman to whom I addressed my discourse, because (as I have        
already observed) he spoke the language of Balnibarbi, said to me with      
a sort of a smile, which usually arises from pity to the ignorant,          
that he was glad of any occasion to keep me among them, and desired my      
permission to explain to the company what I had spoke. He did so,           
and they talked together for some time in their own language,               
whereof I understood not a syllable, neither could I observe by             
their countenances what impression my discourse had made on them.           
After a short silence, the same person told me that his friends and         
mine (so he thought fit to express himself) were very much pleased          
with the judicious remarks I had made on the great happiness and            
advantages of immortal life; and they were desirous to know in a            
particular manner, what scheme of living I should have formed to            
myself, if it had fallen to my lot to have been born a struldbrug.          
  I answered, it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and                  
delightful a subject, especially to me who have been often apt to           
amuse myself with visions of what I should do if I were a king, a           
general, or a great lord; and upon this very case I had frequently run      
over the whole system how I should employ myself and pass the time          
if I were sure to live for ever.                                            
                                                    {P_3|CH_10 ^paragraph 5}
  That if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a              
struldbrug, as soon as I could discover my own happiness by                 
understanding the difference between life and death, I would first          
resolve by an arts and methods whatsoever to procure myself riches. In      
the pursuit of which by thrift and management, I might reasonably           
expect, in about two hundred years to be the wealthiest man in the          
kingdom. In the second place, I would from my earliest youth apply          
myself to the study of arts and sciences, by which I should arrive          
in time to excell all others in learning. Lastly, I would carefully         
record every action and event of consequence that happened in the           
public, impartially draw the characters of the several successions          
of princes and great ministers of state, with my own observations on        
every point. I would exactly set down the several changes in                
customs, language, fashions of dress, diet and diversions. By all           
which acquirements, I should be a living treasury of knowledge and          
wisdom, and certainly become the oracle of the nation.                      
  I would never marry after threescore, but live in an hospitable           
manner, yet still on the saving side. I would entertain myself in           
forming and directing the minds of hopeful young men, by convincing         
them from my own remembrance, experience and observation, fortified by      
numerous examples, of the usefulness of virtue in public and private        
life. But my choice and constant companions should be a set of my           
own immortal brotherhood, among whom I would elect a dozen from the         
most ancient down to my own contemporaries. Where any of these              
wanted fortunes, I would provide them with convenient lodges round          
my own estate, and have some of them always at my table, only mingling      
a few of the most valuable among you mortals, whom length of time           
would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance, and treat your        
posterity after the same manner; just as a man diverts himself with         
the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his garden, without            
regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding year.             
  These struldbrugs and I would mutually communicate our                    
observations and memorials through the course of time, remark the           
several gradations by which corruption steals into the world, and           
oppose it in every step, by giving perpetual warning and instruction        
to mankind; which, added to the strong influence of our own example,        
would probably prevent that continual degeneracy of human nature so         
justly complained of in all ages.                                           
  Add to all this the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of         
states and empires, the changes in the lower and upper world,               
ancient cities in ruins, and obscure villages become the seats of           
kings. Famous rivers lessening into shallow brooks, the ocean               
leaving one coast dry, and overwhelming another; the discovery of many      
countries yet unknown. Barbarity over-running the politest nations,         
and the most barbarous become civilized. I should then see the              
discovery of the longitude, the perpetual motion, the universal             
medicine, and many other great inventions brought to the utmost             
perfection.                                                                 
  What wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy, by outliving      
and confirming our own predictions, by observing the progress and           
returns of comets, with the changes of motion in the sun, moon, and         
stars.                                                                      
                                                   {P_3|CH_10 ^paragraph 10}
  I enlarged upon many other topics, which the natural desire of            
endless life and sublunary happiness could easily furnish me with.          
When I had ended, and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted          
as before, to the rest of the company, there was a good deal of talk        
among them the language of the country, not without some laughter at        
my expense. At last the same gentleman who had been my interpreter          
said he was desired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes,          
which I had fallen into through the common imbecility of human nature,      
and upon that allowance was less answerable for them. That this             
breed of struldbrugs was peculiar to their country, for there were          
no such people either in Balnibarbi or Japan, where he had the honor        
to be ambassador from his Majesty, and found the natives in both those      
kingdoms very hard to believe that the fact was possible; and it            
appeared from my astonishment when he first mentioned the matter to         
me, that I received it as a thing wholly new, and scarcely to be            
credited. That in the two kingdoms above mentioned, where during his        
residence he had conversed very much, he observed long life to be           
the universal desire and wish of mankind. That whoever had one foot in      
the grave was sure to hold back the other as strongly as he could.          
That the oldest had still hopes of living one day longer, and looked        
on death as the greatest evil, from which nature always prompted him        
to retreat; only in this island of Luggnagg the appetite for living         
was not so eager, from the continual example of the struldbrugs before      
their eyes.                                                                 
  That the system of living contrived by me was unreasonable and            
unjust, because it supposed a perpetuity of youth, health, and              
vigor, which no man could be so foolish to hope, however extravagant        
he may be in his wishes. That the question therefore was not whether a      
man would choose to be always in the prime of youth, attended with          
prosperity and health, but how he would pass a perpetual life under         
all the usual disadvantages which old age brings along with it. For         
although few men will avow their desires of being immortal upon such        
hard conditions, yet in the two kingdoms before mentioned of                
Balnibarbi and Japan, he observed that every man desired to put off         
death for some time longer, let it approach ever so late; and he            
rarely heard of any man who died willingly, except he were incited          
by the extremity of grief or torture. And he appealed to me whether in      
those countries I had traveled as well as my own, I had not observed        
the same general disposition.                                               
  After this preface he gave me a particular account of the                 
struldbrugs among them. He said they commonly acted like mortals, till      
about thirty years old, after which by degrees they grew melancholy         
and dejected, increasing in both till they came to fourscore. This          
he learned from their own confession; for otherwise there not being         
above two or three of that species born in an age, they were too few        
to form a general observation by. When they came to fourscore years,        
which is reckoned the extremity of living in this country, they had         
not only all the follies and infirmities of other old men, but many         
more which arose from the dreadful prospect of never dying. They            
were not only opinionative, peevish, covetous, morose, vain,                
talkative, but uncapable of friendship, and dead to all natural             
affection, which never descended below their grandchildren. Envy and        
impotent desires are their prevailing passions. But those objects           
against which their envy principally directed, are the vices of the         
younger sort, and the deaths of the old. By reflecting on the               
former, they find themselves cut off from all possibility of pleasure;      
and whenever they see a funeral, they lament and repine that others         
have gone to a harbor of rest, to which they themselves never can hope      
to arrive. They have no remembrance of anything but what they               
learned and observed in their youth and middle age, and even that is        
very imperfect. And for the truth or particulars of any fact, it is         
safer to depend on common traditions than upon their best                   
recollections. The least miserable among them appear to be those who        
turn to dotage, and entirely lose their memories; these meet with more      
pity and assistance, because they want many bad qualities which abound      
in others.                                                                  
  If a struldbrug happen to marry one of his own kind, the marriage         
is dissolved of course by the courtesy of the kingdom, as soon as           
the younger of the two comes to be fourscore. For the law thinks it         
a reasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned without any           
fault of their own to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not      
have their misery doubled by the load of a wife.                            
  As soon as they have completed the term of eighty years, they are         
looked on as dead in law; their heirs immediately succeed to their          
estates, only a small pittance is reserved for their support, and           
the poor ones are maintained at the public charge. After that period        
they are held incapable of any employment of trust or profit, they          
cannot purchase lands or take leases, neither are they allowed to be        
witnesses in any cause, either civil or criminal, not even for the          
decision of meers and bounds.                                               
                                                   {P_3|CH_10 ^paragraph 15}
  At ninety they lose their teeth and hair, they have at that age no        
distinction of taste, but eat and drink whatever they can get, without      
relish or appetite. The diseases they were subject to still continue        
without increasing or diminishing. In talking they forget the common        
appellation of things, and the names of persons, even of those who are      
their nearest friends and relations. For the same reason they never         
can amuse themselves with reading, because their memory will not serve      
to carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end; and by this      
defect they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they             
might otherwise be capable.                                                 
  The language of this country being always upon the flux, the              
struldbrugs of one age do not understand those of another, neither are      
they able after two hundred years to hold any conversation (farther         
than by a few general words) with their neighbors the mortals; and          
thus they lie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in           
their own country.                                                          
  This was the account given me of the struldbrugs, as near as I can        
remember. I afterwards saw five or six of different ages, the youngest      
not above two hundred years old, who were brought to me at several          
times by some of my friends; but although they were told that I was         
a great traveler, and had seen all the world, they had not the least        
curiosity to ask me a question; only desired I would give them              
slumskudask, or a token of remembrance, which is a modest way of            
begging, to avoid the law that strictly forbids it, because they are        
provided for by the public, although indeed with a very scanty              
allowance.                                                                  
  They are despised and hated by all sorts of people; when one of them      
is born, it is reckoned ominous, and their birth is recorded very           
particularly; so that you may know their age by consulting the              
registry, which however hath not been kept above a thousand years           
past, or at least hath been destroyed by time or public                     
disturbances. But the usual way of computing how old they are, is by        
asking them what kings or great persons they can remember, and then         
consulting history, for infallibly the last prince in their mind did        
not begin his reign after they were fourscore years old.                    
  They were the most mortifying sight I ever beheld, and the women          
more horrible than the men. Besides the usual deformities in extreme        
old age, they acquired an additional ghastliness in proportion to           
their number of years, which is not to be described; and among half         
a dozen, I soon distinguished which was the eldest, although there          
were not above a century or two between them.                               
                                                   {P_3|CH_10 ^paragraph 20}
  The reader will easily believe, that from what I had heard and seen,      
my keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated. I grew             
heartily ashamed of the pleasing visions I had formed, and thought          
no tyrant could invent a death into which I would not run with              
pleasure from such a life. The king heard of all that had passed            
between me and my friends upon this occasion, and rallied me very           
pleasantly, wishing I would send a couple of struldbrugs to my own          
country, to arm our people against the fear of death; but this it           
seems is forbidden by the fundamental laws of the kingdom, or else I        
should have been well content with the trouble and expense of               
transporting them.                                                          
  I could not but agree that the laws of this kingdom relating to           
the struldbrugs, were founded upon the strongest reasons, and such          
as any other country would be under the necessity of enacting in the        
like circumstances. Otherwise, as avarice is the necessary                  
consequent of old age, those immortals would in time become                 
proprietors of the whole nation, and engross the civil power, which,        
for want of abilities to manage, must end in the ruin of the public.        
                                                                            
P_3|CH_11                                                                   
  CHAPTER XI                                                                
-                                                                           
  I thought this account of the Struldbrugs might be some                   
entertainment to the reader, because it seems to be a little out of         
the common way, at least I do not remember to have met the like in any      
book of travels that has come to my hands; and if I am deceived, my         
excuse must be, that it is necessary for travelers, who describe the        
same country, very often to agree in dwelling on the same particulars,      
without deserving the censure of having borrowed or transcribed from        
those who wrote before them.                                                
  There is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the         
great empire of Japan, and it is very probable that the Japanese            
authors may have given some account of the struldbrugs; but my stay in      
Japan was so short, and I was so entirely a stranger to that language,      
that I was not qualified to make any inquiries. But I hope the Dutch        
upon this notice will be curious and able enough to supply my defects.      
  His Majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in his      
court, and finding me absolutely determined to return to my native          
country, was pleased to give me his license to depart, and honored          
me with a letter of recommendation under his own hand to the Emperor        
of Japan. He likewise presented me with four hundred and forty-four         
large pieces of gold (this nation delighting in even numbers), and a        
red diamond which I sold in England for eleven hundred pounds.              
  On the 6th day of May, 1709 I took a solemn leave of his Majesty and      
all my friends. This prince was so gracious as to order a guard to          
conduct me Glanguenstald, which is a royal port to the southwest            
part of the island. In six days I found a vessel ready to carry me          
to Japan, and spent fifteen days in the voyage. We landed at a small        
port town called Xamoschi, situated on the southeast part of Japan;         
the town lies on the western point, where there is a narrow strait,         
leading northward into a long arm of the sea, upon the northwest            
part of which, Yedo the metropolis stands. At landing, I showed the         
custom house officers my letter from the King of Luggnagg to his            
Imperial Majesty. They knew the seal perfectly well; it was as broad        
as the palm of my hand. The impression was, a King lifting up a lame        
beggar from the earth. The magistrates of the town hearing of my            
letter, received me as a public minister. They provided me with             
carriages and servants, and bore my charges to Yedo, where I was            
admitted to an audience, and delivered my letter, which was opened          
with great ceremony, and explained to the Emperor by an interpreter,        
who then gave me notice by his Majesty's order, that I should               
signify my request, and, whatever it were, it should be granted for         
the sake of his royal brother of Luggnagg. This interpreter was a           
person employed to transact affairs with the Hollanders; he soon            
conjectured by my countenance that I was a European, and therefore          
repeated his Majesty's commands in Low Dutch, which he spoke perfectly      
well. I answered (as I had before determined) that I was a Dutch            
merchant, shipwrecked in a very remote country, from whence I traveled      
by sea and land to Luggnagg, and then took shipping for Japan, where I      
knew my countrymen often traded, and with some of these I hoped to get      
an opportunity of returning into Europe: I therefore most humbly            
entreated his royal favor, to give order that I should be conducted in      
safety to Nangasac. To this I added another petition, that for the          
sake of my patron the King of Luggnagg, his Majesty would condescend        
to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on my countrymen, of           
trampling upon the crucifix, because I had been thrown into his             
kingdom by my misfortunes, without any intention of trading. When this      
latter petition was interpreted to the Emperor, he seemed a little          
surprised, and said he believed I was the first of my countrymen who        
ever made any scruple in this point, and that he began to doubt             
whether I was a real Hollander or not, but rather suspected I must          
be a Christian. However, for the reasons I had offered, but chiefly to      
gratify the King of Luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favor, he           
would comply with the singularity of my humor; but the affair must          
be managed with dexterity, and his officers should be commanded to let      
me pass as it were by forgetfulness. For he assured me, that if the         
secret should be discovered by my countrymen the Dutch, they would cut      
my throat in the voyage. I returned my thanks by the interpreter for        
so unusual a favor, and some troops being at that time on their             
march to Nangasac, the commanding officer had orders to convey me safe      
thither, with particular instructions about the business of the             
crucifix.                                                                   
  On the 9th day of June, 1709, I arrived at Nangasac, after a very         
long and troublesome journey. I soon fell into the company of some          
Dutch sailors belonging to the Amboyna, of Amsterdam, a stout ship          
of 450 tons. I had lived long in Holland, pursuing my studies at            
Leyden, and I spoke Dutch well. The seamen soon knew from whence I          
came last: they were curious to inquire into my voyages and course          
of life. I made up a story as short and probable as I could, but            
concealed the greatest part. I knew many persons in Holland; I was          
able to invent names for my parents, whom I pretended to be obscure         
people in the province of Gelderland. I would have given the captain        
(one Theodorus Vangrult) what he pleased to ask for my voyage to            
Holland; but understanding I was a surgeon, he was contented to take        
half the usual rate, on condition that I would serve him in the way of      
my calling. Before we took shipping, I was often asked by some of           
the crew whether I had performed the ceremony above mentioned. I            
evaded the question by general answers, that I had satisfied the            
Emperor and court in all particulars. However, a malicious rogue of         
a skipper went to an officer, and pointing to me, told him I had not        
yet trampled on the crucifix: but the other, who had received               
instructions to let me pass, gave the rascal twenty strokes on the          
shoulders with a bamboo, after which I was no more troubled with            
such questions.                                                             
                                                    {P_3|CH_11 ^paragraph 5}
  Nothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage. We sailed with a        
fair wind to the Cape of Good Hope, where we stayed only to take in         
fresh water. On the 10th of April we arrived safe at Amsterdam, having      
lost only three men by sickness in the voyage, and a fourth who fell        
from the foremast into the sea, not far from the coast of Guinea. From      
Amsterdam I soon after set sail for England in a small vessel               
belonging to that city.                                                     
  On the 16th of April, 1710, we put in at the Downs. I landed the          
next morning, and saw once more my native country after an absence          
of five years and six months complete. I went straight to Redriff,          
where I arrived the same day at two in the afternoon, and found my

  CHAPTER I                                                                 
-                                                                           
  I continued at home with my wife and children about five months in a      
very happy condition, if I could have learned the lesson of knowing         
when I was well. I left my poor wife big with child, and accepted an        
advantageous offer made me to be Captain of the Adventure, a stout          
merchantman of 350 tons: for I understood navigation well, and being        
grown weary of a surgeon's employment at sea, which however I could         
exercise upon occasion, I took a skillful young man of that calling,        
one Robert Purefoy, into my ship. We set sail from Portsmouth upon the      
seventh day of August, 1710; on the fourteenth we met with Captain          
Pocock of Bristol, at Teneriffe, who was going to the bay of Campechy,      
to cut logwood. On the sixteenth he was parted from us by a storm; I        
heard since my return that his ship foundered, and none escaped but         
one cabin boy. He was an honest man, and a good sailor, but a little        
too positive in his own opinions, which was the cause of his                
destruction, as it has been of several others. For if he had                
followed my advice, he might have been safe at home with his family at      
this time, as well as myself.                                               
  I had several men die in my ship of calentures, so that I was forced      
to get recruits out of Barbadoes, and the Leeward Islands, where I          
touched by the direction of the merchants who employed me, which I had      
soon too much cause to repent: for I found afterwards that most of          
them had been buccaneers. I had fifty hands on board, and my orders         
were that I should trade with the Indians in the South Sea, and make        
what discoveries I could. These rogues whom I had picked up                 
debauched my other men, and they all formed a conspiracy to seize           
the ship and secure me; which they did one morning, rushing into my         
cabin, and binding me hand and foot, threatening to throw me                
overboard, if I offered to stir. I told them I was their prisoner           
and would submit. This they made me swear to do, and then they unbound      
me, only fastening one of my legs with a chain near my bed, and placed      
a sentry at my door with his piece charged, who was commanded to shoot      
me dead, if I attempted my liberty. They sent me down victuals and          
drink, and took the government of the ship to themselves. Their design      
was to turn pirates, and plunder the Spaniards, which they could not        
do, till they got more men. But first they resolved to sell the             
goods in the ship, and then go to Madagascar for recruits, several          
among them having died since my confinement. They sailed many weeks,        
and traded with the Indians, but I knew not what course they took,          
being kept a close prisoner in my cabin, and expecting nothing less         
than to be murdered, as they often threatened me.                           
  Upon the ninth day of May, 1711, one James Welch came down to my          
cabin; and said he had orders from the Captain to set me ashore. I          
expostulated with him but in vain; neither would he so much as tell me      
who their new Captain was. They forced me into the longboat, letting        
me put on my best suit of clothes, which were as good as new, and a         
small bundle of linen, but no arms except my hanger; and they were          
so civil as not to search my pockets, into which I conveyed what money      
I had, with some other little necessaries. They rowed about a               
league, and then set me down on a strand. I desired them to tell me         
what country it was. They all swore they knew no more than myself, but      
said that the Captain (as they called him) was resolved, after they         
had sold the lading, to get rid of me in the first place where they         
could discover land. They pushed off immediately, advising me to            
make haste, for fear of being overtaken by the tide, and so bade me         
farewell.                                                                   
  In this desolate condition I advanced forward, and soon got upon          
ground, where I sat down on a bank to rest myself, and consider what I      
had best do. When I was a little refreshed I went up into the country,      
resolving to deliver myself to the first savages I should meet, and         
purchase my life from them by some bracelets, glass rings, and other        
toys which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages,        
and whereof I had some about me. The land was divided by long rows          
of trees, not regularly planted, but naturally growing; there was           
plenty of grass, and several fields of oats. I walked very                  
circumspectly for fear of being surprised, or suddenly shot with an         
arrow from behind or on either side. I fell into a beaten road,             
where I saw many tracks of human feet, and some of cows, but most of        
horses. At last I beheld several animals in a field, and one or two of      
the same kind sitting in trees. Their shape was very singular and           
deformed, which a little discomposed me, so that I lay down behind a        
thicket to observe them better. Some of them coming forward near the        
place where I lay, gave me an opportunity of distinctly marking             
their form. Their heads and breasts were covered with a thick hair,         
some frizzled and others lank; they had beards like goats, and a            
long ridge of hair down their backs and the foreparts of their legs         
and feet, but the rest of their bodies were bare, so that I might           
see their skins, which were of a brown buff color. They had no              
tails, nor any hair at all on their buttocks, except about the anus;        
which, I presume, nature had placed there to defend them as they sat        
on the ground; for this posture they used, as well as lying down and        
often stood on their hind feet. They climbed high trees, as nimbly          
as a squirrel, for they had strong extended claws before and behind,        
terminating in sharp points, and hooked. They would often spring and        
bound and leap with prodigious agility. The females were not so             
large as the males; they had long lank hair on their heads, but none        
on their faces, nor anything more than a sort of down on the rest of        
their bodies, except about the anus, and pudenda. Their dugs hung           
between their forefeet, and often reached almost to the ground as they      
walked. The hair of both sexes was of several colors, brown, red,           
black, and yellow. Upon the whole, I never beheld in all my travels so      
disagreeable an animal, nor one against which I naturally conceived so      
strong an antipathy. So that thinking I had seen enough, full of            
contempt and aversion, I got up and pursued the beaten road, hoping it      
might direct me to the cabin of some Indian. I had not got far when         
I met one of these creatures full in my way, and coming up directly to      
me. The ugly monster, when he saw me, distorted several ways every          
feature of his visage, and stared as at an object he had never seen         
before; then approaching nearer, lifted up his forepaw, whether out of      
curiosity or mischief, I could not tell. But I drew my hanger, and          
gave him a good blow with the flat side of it, for I dare not strike        
him with the edge, fearing the inhabitants might be provoked against        
me, if they should come to know that I had killed or maimed any of          
their cattle. When the beast felt the smart, he drew back, and              
roared so loud that a herd of at least forty came flocking about me         
from the next field, howling and making odious faces; but I ran to the      
body of a tree, and leaning my back against it, kept them off by            
waving my hanger. Several of this cursed brood getting hold of the          
branches behind, leaped up into the tree, from where they began to          
discharge their excrements on my head; however, I escaped pretty well,      
by sticking close to the stem of the tree, but was almost stifled with      
the filth, which fell about me on every side.                               
  In the midst of this distress, I observed them all to run away of         
a sudden as fast as they could, at which I ventured to leave the tree,      
and pursue the road, wondering what it was that could put them into         
this fright. But looking on my left hand, I saw a horse walking softly      
in the field; which my persecutors having sooner discovered, was the        
cause of their flight. The horse started a little when he came near         
me, but soon recovering himself, looked full in my face with                
manifest tokens of wonder; he viewed my hands and feet, walking             
round me several times. I would have pursued my journey, but he placed      
himself directly in the way, yet looking with a very mild aspect,           
never offering the least violence. We stood gazing at each other for        
some time; at last I took the boldness to reach my hand towards his         
neck, with a design to stroke it, using the common style and whistle        
of jockeys when they are going to handle a strange horse. But this          
animal seeming to receive my civilities with disdain, shook his             
head, and bent his brows, softly raising up his right forefoot to           
remove my hand. Then he neighed three or four times, but in so              
different a cadence, that I almost began to think he was speaking to        
himself in some language of his own.                                        
                                                     {P_4|CH_1 ^paragraph 5}
  While he and I were thus employed, another horse came up; who             
applying himself to the first in a very formal manner, they gently          
struck each other's right hoof before, neighing several times by            
turns, and varying the sound, which seemed to be almost articulate.         
They went some paces off, as if it were to confer together, walking         
side by side, backward and forward, like persons deliberating upon          
some affair of weight, but often turning their eyes towards me, as          
it were to watch that I might not escape. I was amazed to see such          
actions and behavior in brute beasts, and concluded with myself,            
that if the inhabitants of this country were endued with a                  
proportionable degree of reason, they must needs be the wisest              
people upon earth. This thought gave me so much comfort, that I             
resolved to go forward until I could discover some house or village,        
or meet with any of the natives, leaving the two horses to discourse        
together as they pleased. But the first, who was a dapple gray,             
observing me to steal off, neighed after me in so expressive a tone,        
that I fancied myself to understand what he meant; whereupon I              
turned back, and came near him, to expect his farther commands, but         
concealing my fear as much as I could, for I began to be in some pain,      
how this adventure might terminate; and the reader will easily believe      
I did not much like my present situation.                                   
  The two horses came up close to me, looking with great earnestness        
upon my face and hands. The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with         
his right forehoof, and discomposed it so much that I was forced to         
adjust it better, by taking it off, and settling it again; whereat          
both he and his companion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much         
surprised; the latter felt the lappet of my coat, and finding it to         
hang loose about me, they both looked with new signs of wonder. He          
stroked my right hand, seeming to admire the softness and color; but        
he squeezed it so hard between his hoof and his pastern, that I was         
forced to roar; after which they both touched me with all possible          
tenderness. They were under great perplexity about my shoes and             
stockings, which they felt very often, neighing to each other, and          
using various gestures, not unlike those of a philosopher, when he          
would attempt to solve some new and difficult phenomenon.                   
  Upon the whole, the behavior of these animals was so orderly and          
rational, so acute and judicious, that I at last concluded they must        
needs be magicians, who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some         
design, and seeing a stranger the way, were resolved to divert              
themselves with him; or perhaps were really amazed at the sight of a        
man so very different in habit, feature, and complexion from those who      
might probably live so remote a climate. Upon the strength of this          
reasoning, I ventured to address them in the following manner:              
Gentlemen, if you be conjurers, as I have good cause to believe, you        
can understand any language; therefore I make bold to let your              
worships know that I am a poor distressed Englishman, driven by his         
misfortunes upon your coast, and I entreat one of you, to let me            
ride upon his back, as if he were a real horse, to some house or            
village where I can be relieved. In return of which favor I will            
make you a present of this knife and bracelet (taking them out of my        
pocket). The two creatures stood silent while I spoke, seeming to           
listen with great attention; and when I had ended, they neighed             
frequently towards each other, as if they were engaged in serious           
conversation. I plainly observed, that their language expressed the         
passions very well, and the words might with little pains be                
resolved into an alphabet more easily than the Chinese.                     
  I could frequently distinguish the word Yahoo, which was repeated by      
each of them several times; and although it was impossible for me to        
conjecture what it meant, yet while the two horses were busy in             
conversation, I endeavored to practice this word upon my tongue; and        
as soon as they were silent, I boldly pronounced Yahoo in a loud            
voice, imitating, at the same time, as near as I could, the neighing        
of a horse; at which they were both visibly surprised, and the gray         
repeated the same word twice, as if he meant to teach me the right          
accent, wherein I spoke after him as well as I could, and found myself      
perceivably to improve every time, though very far from any degree          
of perfection. Then the bay tried me with a second word, much harder        
to be pronounced; but reducing it to the English orthography, may be        
spelt thus, Houyhnhnm. I did not succeed in this so well as the             
former, but after two or three farther trials, I had better fortune;        
and they both appeared amazed at my capacity.                               
  After some further discourse, which I then conjectured might              
relate to me, the two friends took their leave, with the same               
compliment of striking each other's hoof; and the gray made me signs        
that I should walk before him, wherein I thought it prudent to comply,      
till I could find a better director. When I offered to slacken my           
pace, he would cry Hhuun, Hhuun; I guessed his meaning, and gave him        
to understand as well as I could, that I was weary, and not able to         
walk faster; upon which he would stand a while to let me rest.              
                                                                            
P_4|CH_2                                                                    
  CHAPTER II                                                                
-                                                                           
  Having traveled about three miles, we came to a long kind of              
building, made of timber stuck in the ground, and wattled across;           
the roof was low, and covered with straw. I now began to be a little        
comforted, and took out some toys, which travelers usually carry for        
presents to the savage Indians of America and other parts, in hopes         
the people of the house would be thereby encouraged to receive me           
kindly. The horse made me a sign to go in first; it was a large room        
with a smooth clay floor, and a rack and manger extending the whole         
length on one side. There were three nags, and two mares, not               
eating, but some of them sitting down upon their hams, which I very         
much wondered at; but wondered more to see the rest employed in             
domestic business. These seemed but ordinary cattle; however, this          
confirmed my first opinion, that a people who could so far civilize         
brute animals, must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the            
world. The gray came in just after, and thereby prevented any ill           
treatment which the others might have given me. He neighed to them          
several times in a style of authority, and received answers.                
  Beyond this room there were three others, reaching the length of the      
house, to which you passed through three doors, opposite to each            
other, in the manner of a vista; we went through the second room            
towards the third; here the gray walked in first, beckoning me to           
attend: I waited in the second room, and got ready my presents for the      
master and mistress of the house: they were two knives, three               
bracelets of pearl, a small looking glass, and a bead necklace. The         
horse neighed three or four times, and I waited to hear some answers        
in a human voice, but I heard no other returns than in the same             
dialect, only one or two a little shriller than his. I began to             
think that this house must belong to some person of great note among        
them, because there appeared so much ceremony before I could gain           
admittance. But, that a man of quality should be served all by horses,      
was beyond my comprehension. I feared my brain was disturbed by my          
sufferings and misfortunes: I roused myself, and looked about me in         
the room where I was left alone; this was furnished like the first,         
only after a more elegant manner. I rubbed my eyes often, but the same      
objects still occurred. I pinched my arms and sides to awake myself,        
hoping I might be in a dream. then absolutely concluded, that all           
these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic.           
But I had no time to pursue these reflections; for the gray horse came      
to the door, and made me a sign to follow him into the third room,          
where I saw a very comely mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting      
on their haunches, upon mats of straw, not unartfuUy made, and              
perfectly neat and clean.                                                   
  The mare soon after my entrance, rose from her mat, and coming up         
close, after having nicely observed my hands and face, gave me a            
most contemptuous look; then turning to the horse, I heard the word         
Yahoo often repeated betwixt them; the meaning of which word I could        
not then comprehend, although it were the first I had learned to            
pronounce; but I was soon better informed, to my everlasting                
mortification: for the horse beckoning to me with his head, and             
repeating the word Hhuun, Hhuun, as he did upon the road, which I           
understood was to attend him, led me out into a kind of court, where        
was another building at some distance from the house. Here we entered,      
and I saw three of these detestable creatures, whom I first met             
after my landing, feeding upon roots, and the flesh of some animals,        
which I afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs, and now and          
then a cow dead by accident or discase. were all tied by the neck with      
strong withes, fastened to a beam; they held their food between the         
claws of their forefeet, and tore it with their teeth.                      
  The master horse ordered a sorrel nag, one of his servants, to untie      
the largest of these animals, and take him into the yard. The beast         
and I were brought close together, and our countenances diligently          
compared, both by master and servant, who thereupon repeated several        
times the word Yahoo. My horror and astonishment are not to be              
described, when I observed in this abominable animal a perfect human        
figure: the face of it indeed was flat and broad, the nose                  
depressed, the lips large, and the mouth wide. But these differences        
are common to all savage nations, where the lineaments of the               
countenance are distorted by the natives suffering their infants to         
lie groveling on the earth, or by carrying them on their backs,             
nuzzling with their face against the mother's shoulders. The fore feet      
of the Yahoo differed from my hands in nothing else but the length          
of the nails, the coarseness and brownness of the palms, and the            
hairiness on the backs. There was the same resemblance between our          
feet, with the same differences, which I knew very well, though the         
horses did not, because of my shoes and stockings; the same in every        
part of our bodies, except as to hairiness and color, which I have          
already described.                                                          
  The great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was        
to see the rest of my body so very different from that of a Yahoo, for      
which I was obliged to my clothes whereof they had no conception.           
The sorrel nag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner,        
as we shall describe in its proper place) between his hoof and              
pastern; I took it in my hand, and having smelt it, returned it to him      
again as civilly as I could. He brought out of the Yahoo's kennel a         
piece of ass's flesh, but it smelt so offensively that I turned from        
it with loathing: he then threw it to the Yahoo, by whom it was             
greedily devoured. He afterwards showed me a wisp of hay, and a             
fetlock full of oats; but I shook my head, to signify that neither          
of these were food for me. And indeed, I now apprehended that I must        
absolutely starve, if I did not get to some of my own species; for          
as to those filthy Yahoos, although there were few greater lovers of        
mankind, at that time, than myself, yet I confess I never saw any           
sensitive being so detestable on all accounts; and the more I came          
near them, the more hateful they grew, while I stayed in that country.      
This the master horse observed by my behavior, and therefore sent           
the Yahoo back to his kennel. He then put his fore hoof to his              
mouth, at which I was much surprised, although he did it with ease,         
and with a motion that appeared perfectly natural, and made other           
signs to know what I would eat; but I could not return him such an          
answer as he was able to apprehend; and if he had understood me, I did      
not see how it was possible to contrive any way for finding myself          
nourishment. While we were thus engaged, I observed a cow passing           
by, whereupon I pointed to her, and expressed a desire to let me go         
and milk her. This had its effect; for he led me back into the              
house, and ordered a mareservant to open a room, where a good store of      
milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels, after a very orderly and            
cleanly manner. She gave me a large bowl full, of which I drank very        
heartily, and found myself well refreshed.                                  
                                                     {P_4|CH_2 ^paragraph 5}
  About noon I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle, drawn        
like a sledge by four Yahoos. There was in it an old steed, who seemed      
to be of quality; he alighted with his hind feet forward, having by         
accident got a hurt in his left fore foot. He came to dine with our         
horse, who received him with great civility. They dined in the best         
room, and had oats boiled in milk for the second course, which the old      
horse ate warm, but the rest cold. Their mangers were placed                
circular in the middle of the room, and divided into several                
partitions, round which they sat on their haunches upon bosses of           
straw. In the middle was a large rack with angles answering to every        
partition of the manger; so that each horse and mare ate their own          
hay, and their own mash of oats and milk, with much decency and             
regularity. The behavior of the young colt and foal appeared very           
modest, and that of the master and mistress extremely cheerful and          
complaisant to their guest. The gray ordered me to stand by him, and        
much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me, as I        
found by the stranger's often looking on me, and the frequent               
repetition of the word Yahoo.                                               
  I happened to wear my gloves, which the master gray observing,            
seemed perplexed, discovering signs of wonder what I had done to my         
fore feet; he put his hoof three or four times to them, as if he would      
signify that I should reduce them to their former shape, which I            
presently did, pulling off both my gloves, and putting them into my         
pocket. This occasioned farther talk, and I saw the company was             
pleased with my behavior, whereof I soon found the good effects. I was      
ordered to speak the few words I understood, and while they were at         
dinner the master taught the names for oats, milk, fire, water, and         
some others; which I could readily pronounce after him, having from my      
youth a great facility in learning languages.                               
  When dinner was done the master horse took me aside, and by signs         
and words made me understand the concern that he was in, that I had         
nothing to eat. Oats in their tongue are called hlunnh. This word I         
pronounced two or three times; for although I had refused them at           
first, yet upon second thoughts I considered that I could contrive          
to make of them a kind of bread, which might be sufficient with milk        
to keep me alive, till I could make my escape to some other country         
and to creatures of my own species. The horse immediately ordered a         
white mare-servant of his family to bring me a good quantity of oats        
in a sort of wooden tray. These I heated before the fire as well as         
I could, and rubbed them till the husks came off, which I made a shift      
to winnow from the grain; I ground and beat them between two stones,        
then took water, and made them into a paste or cake, which I toasted        
at the fire, and ate warm with milk. It was at first a very insipid         
diet, though common enough in many parts of Europe, but grew tolerable      
by time; and having been often reduced to hard fare in my life, this        
was not the first experiment I had made how easily nature is                
satisfied. And I cannot but observe, that I never had one hour's            
sickness while I stayed in this island. 'Tis true, I sometimes made         
a shift to catch a rabbit or bird by springes made of Yahoos' hairs,        
and I often gathered wholesome herbs, which I boiled, or ate as salads      
with my bread, and now and then, for a rarity, I made a little butter,      
and drank the whey. I was at first at a great loss for salt; but            
custom soon reconciled the want of it; and I am confident that the          
frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury, and was first         
introduced only as a provocative to drink; except where it is               
necessary for preserving of flesh in long voyages, or in places remote      
from great markets. For we observe no animal to be fond of it but man:      
and as to myself, when I left this country, it was a great while            
before I could endure the taste of it in anything that I ate.               
  This is enough to say upon the subject of my diet, wherewith other        
travelers fill their books, as if the readers were personally               
concerned whether we fared well or ill. However, it necessary to            
mention this matter, lest the world should think it impossible that         
I could find sustenance for three years in such a country, and among        
such inhabitants.                                                           
  When it grew towards evening, the master horse ordered a place for        
me to lodge in; it was but six yards from the house, and separated          
from the stable of the Yahoos. Here I got some straw, and covering          
myself with my own clothes, slept very sound. But I was in a short          
time better accommodated, as the reader shall know hereafter, when I        
come to treat more particularly about my way of living.                     
                                                                            
P_4|CH_3                                                                    
  CHAPTER III                                                               
-                                                                           
  My principal endeavor was to learn the language, which my master          
(for so I shall henceforth call him) and his children, and every            
servant of his house, were desirous to teach me. For they looked            
upon it as a prodigy that a brute animal should discover such marks of      
a rational creature. I pointed to every thing and inquired the name of      
it, which I wrote down in my journal book when I was alone, and             
corrected my bad accent by desiring those of the family to pronounce        
it often. In this employment, a sorrel nag, one of the under servants,      
was ready to assist me.                                                     
  In speaking they pronounce through the nose and throat, and their         
language approaches nearest to the High Dutch or German of any I            
know in Europe; but is much more graceful and significant. The Emperor      
Charles made almost the same observation, when he said that if he were      
to speak to his horse it should be in High Dutch.                           
  The curiosity and impatience of my master were so great, that he          
spent many hours of his leisure to instruct me. He was convinced (as        
he afterwards told me) that I must be a Yahoo, but my teachableness,        
civility, and cleanliness, astonished him; which were qualities             
altogether so opposite to those animals. He was most perplexed about        
my clothes, reasoning sometimes with himself whether they were a            
part of my body; for I never pulled them off till the family were           
asleep, and got them on before they waked in the morning. My master         
was eager to learn from where I came, how I acquired those appearances      
of reason which I discovered in all my actions, and to know my story        
from my own mouth, which he hoped he should soon do by the great            
proficiency I made in learning and pronouncing their words and              
sentences. To help my memory, I formed all I learned into the               
English alphabet, and wrote the words down with the translations. Ibis      
last after some time I ventured to do in my master's presence. It cost      
me much trouble to explain to him what I was doing; for the                 
inhabitants have not the least idea of books or literature.                 
  In about ten weeks time I was able to understand most of his              
questions, and in three months could give him some tolerable                
answers. He was extremely curious to know from what part of the             
country I came, and how I was taught to imitate a rational creature;        
because the Yahoos (whom he saw I exactly resembled in my head, hands,      
and face, that were only visible), with some appearance of cunning,         
and the strongest disposition to mischief, were observed to be the          
most unteachable of all brutes. I answered that I came over the sea         
from a far place, with many others of my own kind, in a great hollow        
vessel made of the bodies of trees. That my companions forced me to         
land on this coast, and then left me to shift for myself. It was            
with some difficulty, and by the help of many signs, that I brought         
him to understand me. He replied, that I must needs be mistaken, or         
that I said the thing which was not. (For they have no word in their        
language to express lying or falsehood.) He knew it was impossible          
that there could be a country beyond the sea, or that a parcel of           
brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water.          
He was sure no Houyhnhnm alive could make such a vessel, nor would          
trust Yahoos to manage it.                                                  
  The word Houyhnhnm, in their tongue, signifies a horse, and in its        
etymology, the perfection of nature. I told my master, that I was at a      
loss for expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and hoped        
in a short time I should be able to tell him wonders: he was pleased        
to direct his own mare, his colt and foal, and the servants of the          
family, to take all opportunities of instructing me, and every day for      
two or three hours he was at the same pains himself. Several horses         
and mares of quality in the neighborhood came often to our house            
upon the report spread of a wonderful Yahoo, that could speak like a        
Houyhnhnm, and seemed in his words and actions to discover some             
glimmerings of reason. These delighted to converse with me: they put        
many questions, and received such answers as I was able to return.          
By all these advantages I made so great a progress that in five months      
from my arrival I understood whatever was spoke, and could express          
myself tolerably well.                                                      
                                                     {P_4|CH_3 ^paragraph 5}
  The Houyhnhnms who came to visit my master with the design of seeing      
and talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right Yahoo,           
because my body had a different covering from others of my kind.            
They were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin,          
except on my head, face, and hands; but I discovered that secret to my      
master, upon an accident which happened about a fortnight before.           
  I have already told the reader, that every night when the family          
were gone to bed it was my custom to strip and cover myself with my         
clothes. It happened one morning early, that my master sent for me          
by the sorrel nag, who was his valet; when he came I was fast               
asleep, my clothes fallen off on one side, and my shirt above my            
waist. I awakened at the noise he made, and observed him to deliver         
his message in some disorder; after which he went to my master, and in      
a great fright gave him a very confused account of what he had seen.        
This I presently discovered; for going as soon as I was dressed to pay      
my attendance upon his Honor, he asked me the meaning of what his           
servant had reported, that I was not the same thing when I slept as         
I appeared to be at other times; that his valet assured him, some part      
of me was white, some yellow, at least not so white, and some brown.        
  I had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress, in order to              
distinguish myself as much as possible from that cursed race of             
Yahoos; but now I found it in vain to do so any longer. Besides, I          
considered that my clothes and shoes would soon wear out, which             
already were in a declining condition, and must be supplied by some         
contrivance from the hides of Yahoos or other brutes; whereby the           
whole secret would be known. I therefore told my master that in the         
country from which I came those of my kind always covered their bodies      
with the hairs of certain animals prepared by art, as well for decency      
as to avoid the inclemencies of air, both hot and cold; of which, as        
to my own person, I would give him immediate conviction, if he pleased      
to command me; only desiring his excuse, if I did not expose those          
parts that nature taught us to conceal. He said my discourse was all        
very strange, but especially the last part; for he could not                
understand why nature should teach us to conceal what nature had            
given. That neither himself nor family were ashamed of any parts of         
their bodies; but however I might do as I pleased. Whereupon I first        
unbuttoned my coat and pulled it off. I did the same with my                
waistcoat; I drew off my shoes, stockings, and breeches. I let my           
shirt down to my waist, and drew up the bottom, fastening it like a         
girdle about my middle to hide my nakedness.                                
  My master observed the whole performance with great signs of              
curiosity and admiration. He took up all my clothes in his pastern,         
one piece after another, and examined them diligently; he then stroked      
my body very gently and looked round me several times, after which          
he said it was plain I must be a perfect Yahoo; but that I differed         
very much from the rest of my species, in the softness and whiteness        
and smoothness of my skin, my want of hair in several parts of my           
body, the shape and shortness of my claws behind and before, and my         
affectation of walking continually on my two hind feet. He desired          
to see no more, and gave me leave to put on my clothes again, for I         
was shuddering with cold.                                                   
  I expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the                   
appellation of Yahoo, an odious animal for which I had so utter a           
hatred and contempt. I begged he would forbear applying that word to        
me, and take the same order in his family, and among his friends            
whom he suffered to see me. I requested likewise that the secret of my      
having a false covering to my body might be known to none but himself,      
at least as long as my present clothing should last; for as to what         
the sorrel nag his valet had observed, his Honor might command him          
to conceal it.                                                              
                                                    {P_4|CH_3 ^paragraph 10}
  All this my master very graciously consented to, and thus the secret      
was kept till my clothes began to wear out, which I was forced to           
supply by several contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned. In        
the meantime he desired I would go on with my utmost diligence to           
learn their language, because he was more astonished at my capacity         
for speech and reason than at the figure of my body, whether it were        
covered or not; adding that he waited with some impatience to hear the      
wonders which I promised to tell him.                                       
  From thenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct        
me; he brought me into all company, and made them treat me with             
civility, because, as he told them privately, this would put me into        
good humor and make me more diverting.                                      
  Every day when I waited on him, beside the trouble he was at in           
teaching, he would ask me several questions concerning myself, which I      
answered as well as I could; and by these means he had already              
received some general ideas, though very imperfect. It would be             
tedious to relate the several steps by which I advanced to a more           
regular conversation: but the first account I gave of myself in any         
order and length, was to this purpose:                                      
  That I came from a very far country, as I already had attempted to        
tell him, with about fifty more of my own species; that we traveled         
upon the seas, in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger            
than his Honor's house. I described the ship to him in the best             
terms I could, and explained by the help of my handkerchief displayed,      
how it was driven forward by the wind. That upon a quarrel among us, I      
was set on shore on this coast, where I walked forward without knowing      
whither, till he delivered me from the persecution of those                 
execrable Yahoos. He asked me who made the ship, and how it was             
possible that the Houyhnhnms of my country would leave it to the            
management of brutes? My answer was that I dare proceed no further          
in my relation, unless he would give me his word and honor that he          
would not be offended, and then I would tell him the wonders I had          
so often promised. He agreed; and I went on by assuring him that the        
ship was made by creatures was myself, who in all the countries I           
had traveled, as well as in my own, were the only governing,                
rational animals; and that upon my arrival here I was as much               
astonished to see the Houyhnhnms act like rational beings, as he or         
his friends could be finding some marks of reason in a creature he was      
pleased to call a Yahoo, to which I owned my resemblance in every           
part, but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature.         
I said farther that if good fortune ever restored me to my native           
country, to relate my travels here, as I resolved to do, everybody          
would believe that I said the thing which was not; that I invented the      
story out of my own head; and with all possible respect to himself,         
his family and friends, and under his promise of not being offended,        
our countrymen would hardly think it probable, that a Houyhnhnm should      
be the presiding creature of a nation, and a Yahoo the brute.               
                                                                            
P_4|CH_4                                                                    
  CHAPTER IV                                                                
-                                                                           
  My master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his            
countenance, because doubting, or not believing, are so little known        
in this country, that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave             
themselves under such circumstances. And I remember in frequent             
discourses with my master concerning the nature of manhood in other         
parts of the world, having occasion to talk of lying and false              
representation, it was with much difficulty that he comprehended            
what I meant, although he had otherwise a most acute judgment. For          
he argued thus: that the use of speech was to make us understand one        
another, and to receive information of facts; now if anyone said the        
thing which was not, these ends were defeated; because I cannot             
properly be said to understand him; and I am so far from receiving          
information, that he leaves me worse than in ignorance, for I am led        
to believe a thing black when it is white, and short when it is             
long. And these were all the notions he had concerning that faculty of      
lying, so perfectly well understood among human creatures.                  
  To return from this digression; when I asserted that the Yahoos were      
the only governing animals in my country, which my master said was          
altogether past his conception, he desired to know whether we had           
Houyhnhnms among us, and what was their employment: I told him we           
had great numbers, that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in         
winter were kept in houses, with hay and oats, where Yahoo servants         
were employed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick             
their feet, serve them with food, and make their beds. I understand         
you well, said my master, it is now very plain, from all you have           
spoken, that whatever share of reason the Yahoos pretend to, the            
Houyhnhnms are your masters; I heartily wish our Yahoos would be so         
tractable. I begged his Honor would please to excuse me from                
proceeding any farther, because I was very certain that the account he      
expected from me would be highly displeasing. But he insisted in            
commanding me to let him know the best and the worst: I told him he         
should be obeyed. I owned that the Houyhnhnms among us, whom we called      
horses, were the most generous and comely animals we had, that they         
excelled in strength and swiftness; and when they belonged to               
persons of quality, employed in traveling, racing, or drawing               
chariots, they were treated with much kindness and till they fell into      
diseases or became foundered in the feet; and then they were sold, and      
used to all kind of drudgery till they died; after which their skins        
were stripped and sold for what they were worth, and their bodies left      
to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey. But the common race of            
horses had not so good fortune, being kept by farmers and carriers,         
and other mean people, who put them to great labor, and fed them            
worse. I described, as well as I could, our way of riding, the shape        
and use of a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip, of harness and           
wheels. I added that we fastened plates of a certain hard substance         
called iron at the bottom of their feet, to preserve their hoofs            
from being broken by the stony ways on which we often traveled.             
  My master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered how      
we dared to venture upon a Houyhnhnm's back, for he was sure that           
the weakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the             
strongest Yahoo, or by lying down and rolling on his back squeeze           
the brute to death. I answered that our horses were trained up from         
three or four years old to the several uses we intended them for; that      
if any of them proved intolerably vicious, they were employed for           
carriages; that they were severely beaten while they were young, for        
any mischievous tricks; that the males, designed for common use of          
riding or draught, were generally castrated about two years after           
their birth, to take down their spirits and make them more tame and         
gentle; that they were indeed sensible of rewards and punishments; but      
his Honor would please to consider, that they had not the least             
tincture of reason any more than the Yahoos in this country.                
  It put me to the pains of many circumlocutions to give my master a        
right idea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in           
variety of words, because their wants and passions are fewer than           
among us. But it is impossible to represent his noble resentment at         
our savage treatment of the Houyhnhnm race, particularly after I had        
explained the manner and use of castrating horses among us, to              
hinder them from propagating their kind, and to render them more            
servile. He said if it were possible there could be any country             
where Yahoos alone were endued with reason, they certainly must be the      
governing animal, because reason will in time always prevail against        
brutal strength. But considering the frame of our bodies, and               
especially of mine, he thought no creature of equal bulk was so ill         
contrived, for employing that reason in the common offices of life;         
whereupon he desired to know whether those among whom I lived               
resembled me or the Yahoos of his country. I assured him, that I was        
as well shaped as most of my age; but the younger and the females were      
much more soft and tender, and the skins of the latter generally as         
white as milk. He said I differed indeed from other Yahoos, being much      
more cleanly, and not altogether so deformed, but in point of real          
advantage he thought I differed for the worse. That my nails were of        
no use either to my fore or hind feet; as to my fore feet, he could         
not properly call them by that name, for he never observed me to            
walk upon them; that they were too soft to bear the ground; that I          
generally went with them uncovered, neither was the covering I              
sometimes wore on them of the same shape or so strong as that on my         
feet behind. That I could not walk with any security, for if either of      
my hind feet slipped, I must inevitably fall. He then began to find         
fault with other parts of my body, the flatness of my face, the             
prominence of my nose, my eyes placed directly in front, so that I          
could not look on either side without turning my that I was not able        
to feed myself without lifting one of my fore feet to my mouth; and         
therefore nature had placed these joints to answer that necessity.          
He knew not what could be the use of those several clefts and               
divisions in my feet behind; that these were too soft to bear the           
hardness and sharpness of stones without a covering made from the skin      
of some other brute; that my whole body wanted a fence against heat         
cold, which I was forced to put on and off every day with                   
tediousness and trouble. And lastly that he observed every animal in        
this country naturally to abhor the Yahoos, whom the weaker avoided         
and the stronger drove from them. So that supposing us to have the          
gift of reason, he could not see how it were possible to cure that          
natural antipathy which every creature discovered against us; nor           
consequently, how we could tame and render them serviceable.                
However, he would (as he said) debate the matter no farther, because        
he was more desirous to know my own story, the country where I was          
born, and the several actions and events of my life before I came           
here.                                                                       
  I assured him how extremely desirous I was that he should be              
satisfied on every point; but I doubted much whether it would be            
possible for me to explain myself on several subjects whereof his           
Honor could have no conception, because I saw nothing in his country        
to which I could resemble them. That however I would do my best, and        
strive to express myself by similitudes, humbly desiring his                
assistance when I wanted proper words; which he was pleased to promise      
me.                                                                         
                                                     {P_4|CH_4 ^paragraph 5}
  I said my birth was of honest parents in an island called England,        
which was remote from this country, as many days' journey as the            
strongest of his Honor's servants could travel in the annual course of      
the sun. That I was bred a surgeon, whose trade it is to cure wounds        
and hurts in the body, got by accident or violence; that my country         
was governed by a female man, whom we called a Queen. That I left it        
to get riches, whereby I might maintain myself and family when I            
should return. That in my last voyage I was Commander of the ship, and      
had about fifty Yahoos under me, many of which died at sea, and I           
was forced to supply them by others picked out from several nations.        
That our ship was twice in danger of being sunk; the first time by a        
great storm, and the second, by striking against a rock. Here my            
master interposed, by asking me how I could persuade strangers out          
of different countries to venture with me, after the losses I had           
sustained, and the hazards I had run. I said they were fellows of           
desperate fortunes, forced to fly from the places of their birth, on        
account of their poverty or their crimes. Some were undone by               
lawsuits; others spent all they had in drinking, whoring, and gaming;       
others fled for treason; many for murder, theft, poisoning, robbery,        
perjury, forgery, coining false money, for committing rapes or              
sodomy, for flying from their colors, or deserting to the enemy, and        
most of them had broken prison; none of these dared return to their         
native countries for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a jail;        
and therefore were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in           
other places.                                                               
  During this discourse my master was pleased to interrupt me               
several times; I had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to      
him the nature of the several crimes, for which most of our crew had        
been forced to fly their country. This labor took up several days'          
conversation before he was able to comprehend me. He was wholly at a        
loss to know what could be the use or necessity of practicing those         
vices. To clear up which I endeavored to give some ideas of the desire      
of power and riches, of the terrible effects of lust, intemperance,         
malice and envy. All this I was forced to define and describe by            
putting of cases, and making of suppositions. After which, like one         
whose imagination was struck with something never seen or heard of          
before, he would lift up his eyes with amazement and indignation.           
Power, government, war, law, punishment, and a thousand other things        
had no terms wherein that language could express them, which made           
the difficulty almost insuperable to give my master any conception          
of what I meant. But being of an excellent understanding, much              
improved by contemplation and converse, he at last arrived at a             
competent knowledge of what human nature in our parts of the world          
is capable to perform, and desired I would give him some particular         
account of that land which we call Europe, but especially of my own         
country.                                                                    
                                                                            
P_4|CH_5                                                                    
  CHAPTER V                                                                 
-                                                                           
  The reader may please to observe, that the following extract of many      
conversations I had with my master, contains a summary of the most          
material points which were discoursed at several times for above two        
years; his Honor often desiring fuller satisfaction as I farther            
improved in the Houyhnhnm tongue. I laid before him, as well as I           
could, the whole state of Europe; I discoursed of trade and                 
manufactures, of arts and sciences; and the answers I gave to all           
the questions he made, as they arose upon several subjects, were a          
fund of conversation not to be exhausted. But I shall here only set         
down the substance of what passed between us concerning my own              
country, reducing it into order as well as I can, without any regard        
to time or other circumstances, while I strictly adhere to truth. My        
only concern is that I shall hardly be able to do justice to my             
master's arguments and expressions, which must needs suffer by my want      
of capacity, as well as by a translation into our barbarous English.        
  In obedience therefore to his Honor's commands, I related to him the      
Revolution under the Prince of Orange; the long war with France             
entered into by the said prince, and renewed by his successor the           
present Queen, wherein the greatest powers of Christendom were              
engaged, and which still continued: I computed at his request that          
about a million of Yahoos might have been killed in the whole progress      
of it, and perhaps a hundred or more cities taken, and thrice as            
many ships burnt or sunk.                                                   
  He asked me what were the usual causes or motives that made one           
country go to war with another. I answered they were innumerable,           
but I should only mention a few of the chief. Sometimes the ambition        
of princes, who never think they have land or people enough to govern;      
sometimes the corruption of ministers, who engage their master in a         
war in order to stifle or divert the clamor of the subjects against         
their evil administration. Difference in opinions has cost many             
millions of lives: for instance, whether flesh be bread, or bread be        
flesh; whether the juice of a certain berry be blood or wine;               
whether whistling be vice or a virtue; whether it be better to kiss         
a post, or throw it into the fire; what is the best color for a             
coat, whether black, white, red, or gray; and whether it should be          
long or short, narrow or wide, dirty or clean; with many more. Neither      
are any wars so furious and bloody, or of so long continuance, as           
those occasioned by difference in opinion, especially if it be in           
things indifferent.                                                         
  Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to which of them             
shall dispossess a third of his dominions, where neither of them            
pretend to any right. Sometimes one prince quarrels with another,           
for fear the other should quarrel with him. Sometimes a war is entered      
upon, because the enemy is too strong, and sometimes because he is too      
weak. Sometimes our neighbors want the things which we have, or have        
the things which we want; and we both fight, till they take ours or         
give us theirs. It is a very justifiable cause of a war to invade a         
country after the people have been wasted by famine, destroyed by           
pestilence, or embroiled by factions among themselves. It is                
justifiable to enter into war against our nearest ally, when one of         
his towns lies convenient for us, or a territory of land, that would        
render our dominions round and complete. If a prince sends forces into      
a nation where the people are poor and ignorant, he may lawfully put        
half of them to death, and make slaves of the rest, in order to             
civilize and reduce them from their barbarous way of living. It is a        
very kingly, honorable, and frequent practice, when one prince desires      
the assistance of another to secure him against an invasion, that           
the assistant, when he has driven out the invader, should seize on the      
dominions himself, and kill, imprison or banish the prince he came          
to relieve. Alliance by blood or marriage is a frequent cause of war        
between princes; and the nearer the kindred is, the greater is their        
disposition to quarrel: poor nations are hungry, and rich nations           
are proud; and pride and hunger will ever be at variance. For these         
reasons, the trade of a soldier is held the most honorable of all           
others; because a soldier is a Yahoo hired to kill in cold blood as         
many of his own species, who have never offended him, as possibly he        
can.                                                                        
  There is likewise a kind of beggarly princes in Europe, not able          
to make war by themselves, who hire out their troops to richer              
nations, for so much a day to each man; of which they keep                  
three-fourths to themselves, and it is the best part of their               
maintenance; such are those in Germany and other northern parts of          
Europe.                                                                     
                                                     {P_4|CH_5 ^paragraph 5}
  What you have told me (said my master) upon the subject of war, does      
indeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you               
pretend to: however, it is happy that the shame is greater than the         
danger; and that nature has left you utterly uncapable of doing much        
mischief.                                                                   
  For your mouths lying flat with your faces, you can hardly bite each      
other to any purpose, unless by consent. Then as to the claws upon          
your feet before and behind, they are so short and tender, that one of      
our Yahoos would drive a dozen of yours before him. And therefore in        
recounting the numbers of those who have been killed in battle, I           
cannot but think that you have said the thing which is not.                 
  I could not forbear shaking my head and smiling a little at his           
ignorance. And being no stranger to the art of war, I gave him a            
description of cannons, culverins, muskets, carabines, pistols,             
bullets, powder, swords, bayonets, battles, sieges, retreats, attacks,      
undermines, countermines, bombardments, sea fights; ships sunk with         
a thousand men, twenty thousand killed on each side; dying groans,          
limbs flying in the air, smoke, noise, confusion, trampling to death        
under horses' feet; flight, pursuit, victory; fields strewed with           
carcases left for food to dogs, and wolves, and birds of prey;              
plundering, stripping, ravishing, burning, and destroying. And to           
set forth the valor of my own dear countrymen, I assured him that I         
had seen them blow up a hundred enemies at once in a siege, and as          
many in a ship, and beheld the dead bodies come down in pieces from         
the clouds, to the great diversion of the spectators.                       
  I was going on to more particulars, when my master commanded me           
silence. He said whoever understood the nature of Yahoos might              
easily believe it possible for so vile animals to be capable of             
every action I had named, if their strength and cunning squalled their      
malice. But as my discourse had increased his abhorrence of the             
whole species, so he found it gave him a disturbance in his mind, to        
which he was wholly a stranger before. He thought his ears being            
used to such abominable words, might by degrees admit them with less        
detestation. That although he hated the Yahoos of this country, yet he      
no more blamed them for their odious qualities, than he did a gnnayh        
(a bird of prey) for its cruelty, or a sharp stone for cutting his          
hoof. But when a creature pretending to reason could be capable of          
such enormities, he dreaded lest the corruption of that faculty             
might be worse than brutality itself. He seemed therefore confident,        
that instead of reason, we were only possessed of some quality              
fitted to increase our natural vices; as the reflection from a              
troubled stream returns the image of an ill-shapen body, not only           
larger, but more distorted.                                                 
  He added, that he had heard too much upon the subject of war, both        
in this and some former discourses. There was another point which a         
little perplexed him at present. I had informed him, that some of           
our crew left their country on account of being ruined by Law; that         
I had already explained the meaning of the word; but he was at a            
loss how it should come to pass, that the law which was intended for        
every man's preservation, should be any man's ruin. Therefore he            
desired to be further satisfied what I meant by law, and the                
dispensers thereof, according to the present practice in my own             
country; because he thought nature and reason were sufficient guides        
for a reasonable animal, as we pretended to be, in showing us what          
we ought to do, and what to avoid.                                          
                                                    {P_4|CH_5 ^paragraph 10}
  I assured his Honor that law was a science wherein I had not much         
conversed, further than by employing advocates, in vain, upon some          
injustices that had been done me: however, I would give him all the         
satisfaction I was able.                                                    
  I said there was a society of men among us, bred up from their youth      
in the art of proving by words multiplied for the purpose, that             
white is black, and black is white, according as they are paid. To          
this society all the rest of the people are slaves. For example, if my      
neighbor has a mind to my cow, he hires a lawyer to prove that he           
ought to have my cow from me. I must then hire another to defend my         
right, it being against all rules of law that any man should be             
allowed to speak for himself. Now in this case I who am the right           
owner lie under two great disadvantages. First, my lawyer, being            
practiced almost from his cradle in defending falsehood, is quite           
out of his element when he would be an advocate for justice, which          
as an office unnatural, he always attempts with great awkwardness if        
not with ill-will. The second disadvantage is that my lawyer must           
proceed with great caution, or else he will be reprimanded by the           
judges, and abhorred by his brethren, as one that would lessen the          
practice of the law. And therefore I have but two methods to                
preserve my cow. The first is to gain over my adversary's lawyer            
with a double fee, who will then betray his client by insinuating that      
he has justice on his side. The second way is for my lawyer to make my      
cause appear as unjust as he can by the cow to belong to my adversary:      
and this, if it be skillfully done will certainly bespeak the favor of      
the bench.                                                                  
  Now, your Honour is to know that these judges an appointed to decide      
all controversies of property, as well as for the trial of                  
criminals, and picked out from the most dexterous lawyers, who are          
grown old or lazy, and having been biassed all their lives against          
truth and equity, are under such a fatal necessity of favoring              
fraud, perjury, and oppression, that I have known several of them           
refuse a large bribe from the side where justice lay, rather than           
injure the faculty, by doing any thing unbecoming their nature or           
their office.                                                               
  It is a maxim among these lawyers, that whatever has been done            
before may legally be done again: and therefore they take special care      
to record all the decisions formerly made against common justice and        
the general reason of mankind. These, under the name of precedents,         
they produce as authorities, to justify the most iniquitous                 
opinions; and the judges never fail of directing accordingly.               
  In pleading they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the         
cause, but are loud, violent, and tedious in dwelling upon all              
circumstances which are not to the purpose. For instance, in the            
case already mentioned, they never desire to know what claim or             
title my adversary has to my cow; but whether the said cow were red or      
black, her horns long or short, whether the field I graze her in be         
round or square, whether she was milked at home or abroad, what             
diseases she is subject to, and the like; after which they consult          
precedents, adjourn the cause from time to time, and in ten, twenty,        
or thirty years, come to an issue.                                          
                                                    {P_4|CH_5 ^paragraph 15}
  It is likewise to be observed, that this society has a peculiar cant      
and jargon of their own, that no other mortal can understand, and           
wherein all their laws are written, which they take special care to         
multiply; whereby they have wholly confounded the very essence of           
truth and falsehood, of right and wrong; so that it will take thirty        
years to decide whether the field left me by my ancestors for six           
generations belongs to me, or to a stranger three hundred miles off.        
  In the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state the          
method is much more short and commendable: the judge first sends to         
sound the disposition of those in power, after which he can easily          
hang or save the criminal, strictly preserving all due forms of law.        
  Here my master interposing, said it was a pity that creatures             
endowed with such prodigious abilities of mind as these lawyers, by         
the description I gave of them, must certainly be, were not rather          
encouraged to be instructors of others in wisdom and knowledge. In          
answer to which I assured his Honor that in all points out of their         
own trade, they were usually the most ignorant and stupid generation        
among us, the most despicable in common conversation, avowed enemies        
to all knowledge and learning, and equally to pervert the general           
reason of mankind in every other subject of discourse, as in that of        
their own profession.                                                       
                                                                            
P_4|CH_6                                                                    
  CHAPTER VI                                                                
-                                                                           
  My master was yet wholly at a loss to understand what motives             
could incite this race of lawyers to perplex, disquiet, and weary           
themselves, and engage in a confederacy of injustice, merely for the        
sake of injuring their fellow animals; neither could he comprehend          
what I meant in saying they did it for hire. Whereupon I was at much        
pains to describe to him the use of money, the materials it was made        
of, and the value of the metals; that when a Yahoo had got a great          
store of this precious substance, he was able to purchase whatever          
he had a mind to; the finest clothing, the noblest houses, great            
tracts of land, the most costly meats and drinks, and have his              
choice of the most beautiful females. Therefore since money alone           
was able to perform all these feats, our Yahoos thought they could          
never have enough of it to spend or save, as they found themselves          
inclined from their natural bent either to profusion or avarice.            
That the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor man's labor, and the        
latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former. That the         
bulk of our people were forced to live miserably, by laboring every         
day for small wages to make a few live plentifully. I enlarged              
myself much on these and many other particulars to the same purpose;        
but his Honor was still to seek; for he went upon a supposition that        
all animals had a title to their share in the productions of the            
earth, and especially those who presided over the rest. Therefore he        
desired I would let him know what these costly meats were, and how any      
of us happened to want them. Whereupon I enumerated as many sorts as        
came into my head, with the various methods of dressing them, which         
could not be done without sending vessels by sea to every part of           
the world, as well for liquors to drink, as for sauces, and                 
innumerable other conveniences. I assured him that this whole globe of      
earth must be at least three times gone round, before one of our            
better female Yahoos could get her breakfast or a cup to put it in. He      
said that must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish            
food for its own inhabitants. But what he chiefly wondered at, was how      
such vast tracts of ground as I described should be wholly without          
fresh water, and the people put to the necessity of sending over the        
sea for drink. I replied that England (the dear place of my                 
nativity) was computed to produce three times the quantity of food,         
more than its inhabitants are able to consume, as well as liquors           
extracted from grain, or pressed out of the fruit of certain trees,         
which made excellent drink, and the same proportion in every other          
convenience of life. But, in order to feed the luxury and intemperance      
of the males, and the vanity of the females, we sent away the greatest      
part of our necessary things to other countries, from whence in return      
we brought the materials of diseases, folly, and vice, to spend             
among ourselves. Hence it follows of necessity that vast numbers of         
our people are compelled to seek their livelihood by begging, robbing,      
stealing, cheating, pimping, forswearing, flattering, suborning,            
forging, gaming, lying, fawning, hectoring, voting, scribbling,             
star-gazing, poisoning, whoring, canting, libeling, free thinking, and      
the like occupations: every one of which terms, I was at much pains to      
make him understand.                                                        
  That wine was not imported among us from foreign countries, to            
supply the want of water or other drinks, but because it was a sort of      
liquid which made us merry by putting us out of our senses, diverted        
all melancholy thoughts, begat wild extravagant imaginations in the         
brain, raised our hopes, and banished our fears, suspended every            
office of reason for a time, and deprived us of the use of our              
limbs, till we fell into a profound sleep; although it must be              
confessed, that we always awoke sick and dispirited and that the use        
of this liquor filled us with diseases, which made our lives                
uncomfortable and short.                                                    
  But beside all this, the bulk of our people supported themselves          
by furnishing the necessities or conveniences of life to the rich, and      
to each other. For instance, when I am at home and dressed as I             
ought to be, I carry on my body the workmanship of a hundred                
tradesmen; the building and furniture of my house employ as many more,      
and five times the number to adorn my wife.                                 
  I was going on to tell him of another sort of people, who get             
their livelihood by attending the sick, having upon some occasions          
informed his Honor that many of my crew had died of diseases. But here      
it was with the utmost difficulty that I brought him to apprehend what      
I meant. He could easily conceive that a Houyhnhnm grew weak and heavy      
a few days before his death, or by some accident might hurt a limb.         
But that nature, who works all things to perfection, should suffer any      
pains to breed in our bodies, he thought impossible, and desired to         
know the reason of so unaccountable an evil. I told him we fed on a         
thousand things which operated contrary to each other; that we ate          
when we were not hungry, and drank without the provocation of               
thirst; that we sat whole nights strong liquors without eating a            
bit, which disposed us to sloth, inflamed our bodies, and precipitated      
or prevented digestion. That prostitute female Yahoos acquired a            
certain malady, which bred rottenness in the bones of those who fell        
into their embraces; that this and many other diseases were propagated      
from father to son, so that great numbers come into the world with          
complicated maladies upon them; that it would be endless to give him a      
catalogue of all diseases incident to human bodies; for they could not      
be fewer than five or six hundred, spread over every limb and joint;        
in short, every part, external and intestine, having diseases               
appropriated to them. To remedy which there was a sort of people            
bred up among us, in the profession or pretense of curing the sick.         
And because I had some skill in the faculty, I would in gratitude to        
his Honor let him know the whole mystery and method by which they           
proceed.                                                                    
  Their fundamental is that all diseases arise from repletion, from         
which they conclude that a great evacuation of the body is                  
necessary, either through the natural passage or upwards at the mouth.      
Their next business is from herbs, minerals, gums, oils, shells,            
salts, juices, seaweed, excrements, barks of trees, serpents, toads,        
frogs, spiders, dead men's flesh and bone, birds, beasts and fishes,        
to form a composition for smell and taste the most abominable,              
nauseous and detestable they can possibly contrive, which the               
stomach immediately rejects with loathing; and this they call a vomit;      
or else from the same storehouse, with some other poisonous additions,      
they command us to take in at the orifice above or below (just as           
the physician then happens to be disposed) a medicine equally annoying      
and disgustful to the bowels; which relaxing the belly, drives down         
all before it, and this they call a purge or a cluster. For nature (as      
the physicians allege) having intended the superior anterior orifice        
only for the intromission of solids and liquids, and the inferior           
posterior for ejection, these artists ingeniously considering that          
in all diseases nature is forced out of her seat, therefore to replace      
her in it the body must be treated in a manner directly contrary, by        
interchanging the use of each orifice, forcing solids and liquids in        
at the anus, and making evacuations at the mouth.                           
                                                     {P_4|CH_6 ^paragraph 5}
  But besides real diseases we are subject to many that are only            
imaginary, for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures;          
these have their several names, and so have the drugs that are              
proper for them, and with these our female Yahoos are always infested.      
  One great excellency in this tribe is their skiff at prognostics,         
wherein they seldom fail; their predictions in real diseases, when          
they rise to any degree of malignity, generally portending death,           
which is always in their power, when recovery is not: and therefore,        
upon any unexpected signs of amendment, after they have pronounced          
their sentence, rather than be accused as false prophets, they know         
how to approve their sagacity to the world by a seasonable dose.            
  They are likewise of special use to husbands and wives who are grown      
weary of their mates, to eldest sons, to great ministers of state, and      
often to princes.                                                           
  I had formerly upon occasion discoursed with my master upon the           
nature of government in general, and particularly of our own excellent      
constitution, deservedly the wonder and envy of the whole world. But        
having here accidentally mentioned a minister of state, he commanded        
me some time after to inform him what species of Yahoo I                    
particularly meant by that appellation.                                     
  I told him that a First or Chief Minister of State, who was the           
person I intended to describe, was a creature wholly exempt from joy        
and grief, love and hatred, pity and anger; at least made use of no         
other passions but a violent desire of wealth, power, and titles; that      
he applies his words to all uses, except to the indication of his           
mind; that he never tells a truth but with an intent that you should        
take it for a lie; nor a lie but with a design that you should take it      
for a truth; that those he speaks worst of behind their backs are in        
the surest way of preferment; and whenever he begins to praise you          
to others or to yourself, you are from that day forlorn. The worst          
mark you can receive is a promise, especially when it is confirmed          
with an oath; after which every wise man retires, and gives over all        
hopes.                                                                      
                                                    {P_4|CH_6 ^paragraph 10}
  There are three methods by which a man may rise to be chief               
minister: the first is by knowing how with prudence to dispose of a         
wife, a daughter, or a sister: the second, by betraying or undermining      
his predecessor: and the third is by a furious zeal in public               
assemblies against the corruptions of the court. But a wise prince          
would rather choose to employ those who practice the last of these          
methods; because such zealots prove always the most obsequious and          
subservient to the will and passions of their master. That these            
ministers having all employments at their disposal, preserve                
themselves in power by bribing the majority of a senate or great            
council; and at last, by an expedient called an Act of Indemnity            
(whereof I described the nature to him) they secure themselves from         
after reckonings, and retire from the public, laden with the spoils of      
the nation.                                                                 
  The palace of a chief minister is a seminary to breed up others in        
his own trade: the pages, lackeys, and porter, by imitating their           
master, become ministers of state in their several districts, and           
learn to excel in the three principal ingredients of insolence, lying,      
and bribery. Accordingly they have a subaltern court paid to them by        
persons of the best rank, and sometimes by the force of dexterity           
and impudence arrive through several gradations to be successors to         
their lord.                                                                 
  He is usually governed by a decayed wench or favorite footman, who        
are the tunnels through which all graces are conveyed, and may              
properly be called, in the last resort, the governors of the kingdom.       
  One day in discourse my master, having heard me mention the nobility      
of my country, was pleased to make me a compliment which I could not        
pretend to deserve: that he was sure I must have been born of some          
noble family, because I far exceeded in shape, color, and cleanliness,      
all the Yahoos of his nation, although I seemed to fail in strength         
and agility, which must be imputed to my different way of living            
from those other brutes; and besides I was not only endowed with the        
faculty of speech, but likewise with some rudiments of reason, to a         
degree that with all his acquaintance I passed for a prodigy.               
  He made me observe, that among the Houyhnhnms, the white, the             
sorrel, and the iron grey were not so exactly shaped as the bay, the        
dapple grey, and the black; nor born with equal talents of the mind,        
or a capacity to improve them; and therefore continued always in the        
condition of servants, without ever aspiring to match out of their own      
race, which in that country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural.      
                                                    {P_4|CH_6 ^paragraph 15}
  I made his Honor my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion      
he was pleased to conceive of me; but assured him at the same time          
that my birth was of the lower sort, having been born of plain              
honest parents, who were just able to give me a tolerable education;        
that nobility among us was altogether a different thing from the            
idea he had of it; that our young noblemen are bred from their              
childhood in idleness and luxury; that as soon as years will permit,        
they consume their vigor and contract odious diseases among lewd            
females; and when their fortunes are almost ruined, they marry some         
woman of mean birth, disagreeable person, and unsound constitution,         
merely for the sake of money, whom they hate and despise. That the          
productions of such marriages are generally scrofulous, rickety, or         
deformed children; by which means the family seldom continues above         
three generations, unless the wife takes care to provide a healthy          
father among her neighbors or domestics, in order to improve and            
continue the breed. That a weak diseased body, a meagre countenance,        
and sallow complexion, are the true marks of noble blood; and a             
healthy robust appearance is so disgraceful in a man of quality,            
that the world concludes his real father to have been a groom or a          
coachman. The imperfections of his mind run parallel with those of his      
body, being a composition of spleen, dullness, ignorance, caprice,          
sensuality and pride.                                                       
  Without the consent of this illustrious body no law can be                
enacted, repealed, or altered; and these have the decision of all           
our possessions without appeal.                                             
                                                                            
P_4|CH_7                                                                    
  CHAPTER VII                                                               
-                                                                           
  The reader may be disposed to wonder how I could prevail on myself        
to give so free a representation of my own species, among a race of         
mortals who were already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of          
human kind, from that entire congruity betwixt me and their Yahoos.         
But I must freely confess that the many virtues of those excellent          
quadrupeds placed in opposite view to human corruptions, had so far         
opened my eyes and enlarged my understanding, that I began to view the      
actions and passions of man in a very different light, and to think         
the honor of my own kind not worth managing; which, besides, it was         
impossible for me to do before a person of so acute a judgment as my        
master, who daily convinced me of a thousand faults in myself, whereof      
I had not the least perception before, and which among us would             
never be numbered even among human infirmities. I had likewise learned      
from his example an utter detestation of all falsehood or disguise,         
and truth appeared so amiable to me, that I determined upon                 
sacrificing everything to it.                                               
  Let me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was      
yet a much stronger motive for the freedom I took in my representation      
of things. I had not been a year in this country before I contracted        
such a love and veneration for the inhabitants, that I entered on a         
firm resolution never to return to human kind, but to pass the rest of      
my life among these admirable Houyhnhnms in the contemplation and           
practice of every virtue; where I could have no example or                  
incitement to vice. But it was decreed by fortune, my perpetual enemy,      
that so great a felicity should not fall to my share. However, it is        
now some comfort to reflect that in what I said of my countrymen I          
extenuated their faults as much as I dared before so strict an              
examiner, and upon every article gave as favorable a turn as the            
matter would bear. For indeed who is there alive that will not be           
swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of his birth?                
  I have related the substance of several conversations I had with          
my master, during the greatest part of the time I had the honor to          
be in his service, but have indeed for brevity sake omitted much            
more than is here set down.                                                 
  When I had answered all his questions, and his curiosity seemed to        
be fully satisfied, he sent for me one morning early, and commanding        
me to sit down at some distance (an honor which he had never before         
conferred upon me), he said he had been very seriously considering          
my whole story, as far as it related both to myself and my country;         
that he looked upon us as sort of animals to whose share, by what           
accident he could not conjecture, some small pittance of reason had         
fallen, whereof we made no other use than by its assistance to              
aggravate our natural corruptions, and to acquire new ones which            
nature had not given us. That we disarmed ourselves of the few              
abilities she had bestowed, had been very successful in multiplying         
our original wants, and seemed to spend our whole lives in vain             
endeavors to supply them by our own inventions. That as to myself,          
it was manifest I had neither the strength or agility of a common           
Yahoo, that I walked infirmly on my hinder feet, had found out a            
contrivance to make my claws of no use or defense, and to remove the        
hair from my chin, which was intended as a shelter from the sun and         
the weather. Lastly, that I could neither run with speed, nor climb         
trees like my brethren (as he called them) the Yahoos in this country.      
  That our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to         
our gross defects in reason, and by consequence, in virtue; because         
reason alone is sufficient to govern a rational creature; which was         
therefore a character we had no pretense to challenge, even from the        
account I had given of my own people; although he manifestly perceived      
that in order to favor them I had concealed many particulars, and           
often said the thing which was not.                                         
                                                     {P_4|CH_7 ^paragraph 5}
  He was the more confirmed in this opinion, because he observed            
that as I agreed in every feature of my body with other Yahoos, except      
where it was to my real disadvantage in point of strength, speed and        
activity, the shortness of my claws, and some other particulars             
where nature had no part; so from the representation I had given him        
of our lives, our manners, and our actions, he found as near a              
resemblance in the disposition of our minds. He said the Yahoos were        
known to hate one another more than they did any different species          
of animals; and the reason usually assigned was the odiousness of           
their own shapes, which all could see in the rest, but not in               
themselves. He had therefore begun to think it not unwise in us to          
cover our bodies, and by that invention conceal many of our own             
deformities from each other, which would else be hardly supportable.        
But he now found he had been mistaken, and that the dissensions of          
those brutes in his country were owing to the same cause with ours, as      
I had described them. For if (said he) you throw among five Yahoos          
as much food as would be sufficient for fifty, they will, instead of        
eating peaceably, fall together by the ears, each single one impatient      
to have all to itself; and therefore a servant was usually employed to      
stand by while they were feeding abroad, and those kept at home were        
tied at a distance from each other: that if a cow died of age or            
accident, before a Houyhnhnm could secure it for his own Yahoos, those      
in the neighborhood would come in herds to seize it, and then would         
ensue such a battle as I had described, with terrible wounds made by        
their claws on both sides, although they seldom were able to kill           
one another, for want of such convenient instruments of death as we         
had invented. At other times the like battles have been fought between      
the Yahoos of several neighborhoods without any visible cause; those        
of one district watching all opportunities to surprise the next before      
they are prepared. But if they find their project has miscarried, they      
return home, and, for want of enemies, engage in what I call a civil        
war among themselves.                                                       
  That in some fields of his country there are certain shining              
stones of several colors, whereof the Yahoos are violently fond, and        
when part of these stones is fixed in the earth, as it sometimes            
happens, they will dig with their claws for whole days to get them          
out, then carry them away, and hide them by heaps in their kennels;         
but still looking round with great caution, for fear their comrades         
should find out their treasure. My master said he could never discover      
the reason of this unnatural appetite, or how these stones could be of      
any use to a Yahoo; but now he believed it might proceed from the same      
principle of avarice which I had ascribed to mankind: that he had           
once, by way of experiment, privately removed a heap of these stones        
from the place where one of his Yahoos had buried it: whereupon the         
sordid animal missing his treasure, by his loud lamenting brought           
the whole herd to the place, there miserably howled, then fell to           
biting and tearing the rest, began to pine away, would neither eat nor      
sleep nor work, till he ordered a servant privately to convey the           
stones into the same hole and hide them as before; which when his           
Yahoo had found, he presently recovered his spirits and good humor,         
but took good care to remove them to a better hiding place, and has         
ever since been a very serviceable brute.                                   
  My master farther assured me, which I also observed myself, that          
in the fields where the shining stones abound, the fiercest and most        
frequent battles are fought, occasioned by perpetual inroads of the         
neighboring Yahoos.                                                         
  He said it was common when two Yahoos discovered such a stone in a        
field, and were contending which of them should be the proprietor, a        
third would take the advantage, and carry it away from them both;           
which my master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance        
with our suits at law; wherein I thought it for our credit not to           
undeceive him; since the decision he mentioned was much more equitable      
than many decrees among us; because the plaintiff and defendant             
there lost nothing beside the stone they contended for, whereas our         
courts of equity would never have dismissed the cause while either          
of them had any thing left.                                                 
  My master, his discourse, said there was nothing that rendered the        
Yahoos more odious than their undistinguishing appetite to devour           
every thing that came in their way, whether herbs, roots, berries, the      
corrupted flesh of animals, or all mingled together; and it was             
peculiar in their temper that they were fonder of what they could           
get by rapine or stealth at a greater distance than much better food        
provided for them at home. If their prey held out, they would eat till      
they were ready to burst, after which nature had pointed out to them a      
certain root that gave them a general evacuation.                           
                                                    {P_4|CH_7 ^paragraph 10}
  There was also another kind of root very juicy, but somewhat rare         
and difficult to be found, which the Yahoos sought for with much            
eagerness, and would suck it with great delight; and it produced in         
them the same effects that wine has upon us. It would make them             
sometimes hug, and sometimes tear one another; they would howl and          
grin, and chatter, and reel, and tumble, and then fall asleep in the        
dirt.                                                                       
  I did indeed observe that the Yahoos were the only animals in this        
country subject to any diseases; which, however, were much fewer            
than horses have among us, and contracted not by any ill treatment          
they meet with, but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid          
brute. Neither has their language any more than a general                   
appellation for those maladies, which is borrowed from the name of the      
beast, and called Hnea-Yahoo, or the Yahoo's evil, and the cure             
prescribed is a mixture of their own dung and urine forcibly put            
down the Yahoo's throat. This I have since often known to have been         
taken with success, and do freely recommend it to my countrymen, for        
the public good, as an admirable specific against all diseases              
produced by repletion.                                                      
  As to learning, government, arts, manufactures, and the like, my          
master confessed he could find little or no resemblance between the         
Yahoos of that country and those in ours. For he only meant to observe      
what parity there was in our natures. He had heard indeed some curious      
Houyhnhnms observe that in most herds there was a sort of ruling Yahoo      
(as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in a         
park), who was always more deformed in body and mischievous in              
disposition than any of the rest. That this leader had usually a            
favorite as like himself as he could get, whose employment was to lick      
his master's feet and posteriors, and drive the female Yahoos to his        
kennel; for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of ass's        
flesh. This favorite is hated by the whole herd, and therefore to           
protect himself, keeps always near the person of his leader. He             
usually continues in office till worse can be found; but the very           
moment he is discarded, his successor, at the head of all the Yahoos        
in that district, young and old, male and female, come in a body,           
and discharge their excrements upon him from head to foot. But how far      
this might be applicable to our courts and favorites, and ministers of      
state, my master said I could best determine.                               
  I dared make no return to this malicious insinuation, which               
debased human understanding below the sagacity of a common hound,           
who has judgment enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the            
ablest dog in the pack, without being ever mistaken.                        
  My master told me there were some qualities remarkable in the             
Yahoos, which he had not observed me to mention, or at least very           
slightly, in the accounts I had given him of human kind. He said those      
animals, like other brutes, had their females in common; but in this        
they differed, that the she Yahoo would admit the male while she was        
pregnant; and that the hes would quarrel and fight with the females as      
fiercely as with each other. Both which practices were such degrees of      
brutality, that no other sensitive creature ever arrived at.                
                                                    {P_4|CH_7 ^paragraph 15}
  Another thing he wondered at in the Yahoos was their strange              
disposition to nastiness and dirt, whereas there appears to be a            
natural love of cleanliness in all other animals. As to the former          
accusation, I was glad to let it pass without any reply, because I had      
not a word to offer upon it in defense of my species, which                 
otherwise I certainly had done from my own inclinations. But I could        
have easily vindicated human kind from the imputation of singularity        
upon the last article, if there had been any swine in that country (as      
unluckily for me there were not), which although it may be a sweeter        
quadruped than a Yahoo, cannot I humbly conceive in justice pretend to      
more cleanliness; and so his Honor himself must have owned, if he           
had seen their filthy way of feeding, and their custom of wallowing         
and sleeping in the mud.                                                    
  My master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants           
had discovered in several Yahoos, and to him was wholly unaccountable.      
He said, a fancy would sometimes take a Yahoo to retire into a corner,      
to lie down and howl and groan, and spurn away all that came near him,      
although he were young and fat, wanted neither food nor water; nor did      
the servants imagine what could possibly ail him. And the only              
remedy they found was to set him to hard work, after which he would         
infallibly come to himself. To this I was silent out of partiality          
to my own kind; yet here I could plainly discover the true seeds of         
spleen, which only seizes on the lazy, the luxurious, and the rich;         
who, if they were forced to undergo the same regimen, I would               
undertake for the cure.                                                     
  His Honor had further observed that a female Yahoo would often stand      
behind a bank or a bush, to gaze on the young males passing by, and         
then appear, and hide, using many antic gestures and grimaces, at           
which time it was observed that she had a most offensive smell; and         
when any of the males advanced, would slowly retire, looking often          
back, and with a counterfeit show of fear, run off into some                
convenient place where she knew the male would follow her.                  
  At other times if a female stranger came among them, three or four        
of her own sex would get about her, and stare and chatter, and grin,        
and smell her all over; and then turn off with gestures that seemed to      
express contempt and disdain.                                               
  Perhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations, which      
he had drawn from what he observed himself, or had been told him by         
others; however, I could not reflect without some amazement, and            
much sorrow, that the rudiments of coquetry, censure, and scandal,          
should have place by instinct in womankind.                                 
                                                    {P_4|CH_7 ^paragraph 20}
  I expected every moment that my master would accuse the Yahoos of         
those unnatural appetites in both sexes, so common among us. But            
nature, it seems, has not been so expert a school mistress; and             
these politer pleasures are entirely the productions of art and             
reason, on our side of the globe.                                           
                                                                            
P_4|CH_8                                                                    
  CHAPTER VIII                                                              
-                                                                           
  As I ought to have understood human nature much better than I             
supposed it possible for my master to do, so it was easy to apply           
the character he gave of the Yahoos to myself and my countrymen; and I      
believed I could yet make farther discoveries from my own observation.      
I therefore often begged his favor to let me go among the herds of          
Yahoos in the neighborhood, to which he always very graciously              
consented, being perfectly convinced that the hatred I bore those           
brutes would never suffer me to be corrupted by them; and his Honor         
ordered one of his servants, a strong sorrel nag, very honest and           
good-natured, to be my guard, without whose protection I dare not           
undertake such adventures. For I have already told the reader how much      
I was pestered by those odious animals upon my first arrival. And I         
afterwards failed very narrowly three or four times of falling into         
their clutches, when I happened to stray at any distance without my         
hanger. And I have reason to believe they had some imagination that         
I was of their own species, which I often assisted myself, by               
stripping up my sleeves, and showing my naked arms and breast in their      
sight, when my protector was with me. At which times they would             
approach as near as they dare, and imitate my actions after the manner      
of monkeys, but ever with great signs of hatred; as a tame jackdaw          
with cap and stockings is always persecuted by the wild ones, when          
he happens to get among them.                                               
  They are prodigiously nimble from their infancy; however, I once          
caught a young male of three years old, and endeavored by all marks of      
tenderness to make it quiet; but the little imp fell a squalling and        
scratching and biting with such violence that I was forced to let it        
go; and it was high time, for a whole troop of old ones came about          
us at the noise, but finding the cub was safe (for away it ran), and        
my sorrel nag being by, they dare not venture near us. I observed           
the young animal's flesh to smell very rank, and the stink was              
somewhat between a weasel and a fox, but much more disagreeable. I          
forgot another circumstance (and perhaps I might have the reader's          
pardon if it were wholly omitted), that while I held the odious vermin      
in my hands, it voided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid             
substance, all over my clothes; but by good fortune there was a             
small brook hard by, where I washed myself as clean as I could;             
although I dare not come into my master's presence, until I were            
sufficiently aired.                                                         
  By what I could discover, the Yahoos appear to be the most                
unteachable of all animals, their capacities never reaching higher          
than to draw or carry burdens. Yet I am of opinion this defect              
arises chiefly from a perverse, restive disposition. For they are           
cunning, malicious, treacherous, and revengeful. They are strong and        
hardy, but of a cowardly spirit, and by consequence, insolent, abject,      
and cruel. It is observed that the red haired of both sexes are more        
libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in      
strength and activity.                                                      
  The Houyhnhnms keep the Yahoos for present use in huts not far            
from the house; but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields,             
where they dig up roots, eat several kinds of herbs, and search             
about for carrion, or sometimes catch weasels and luhimuhs (a sort          
of wild rat), which they greedily devour. Nature has taught them to         
dig deep holes with their nails on the side of a rising ground,             
wherein they lie by themselves; only the kennels of the females are         
larger, sufficient to hold two or three cubs.                               
  They swim from their infancy like frogs, and are able to continue         
long under water, where they often take fish, which the females             
carry home to their young. And upon this occasion, I hope the reader        
will pardon my relating an odd adventure.                                   
                                                     {P_4|CH_8 ^paragraph 5}
  Being one day abroad with my protector, the sorrel nag, and the           
weather exceeding hot, I entreated him to let me bathe in a river that      
was near. He consented, and I immediately stripped myself stark naked,      
and went down softly into the stream. It happened that a young              
female Yahoo, standing behind a bank, saw the whole proceeding, and         
inflamed by desire, as the nag and I conjectured, came running with         
all speed, and leaped into the water, within five yards of the place        
where I bathed. I was never in my life so terribly frighted; the nag        
was grazing at some distance, not suspecting any harm. She embraced me      
after a most fulsome manner; I roared as loud as I could, and the           
nag came galloping towards me, whereupon she quitted her grasp, with        
the utmost reluctancy, and leaped upon the opposite bank, where she         
stood gazing and howling all the time I was putting on my clothes.          
  This was matter of diversion to my master and his family, as well as      
of mortification to myself. For now I could no longer deny that I           
was a real Yahoo in every limb and feature, since the females had a         
natural propensity to me, as one of their own species. Neither was the      
hair of this brute of a red color (which might have been some excuse        
for an appetite a little irregular), but black as a sloe, and her           
countenance did not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the         
rest of the kind; for, I think, she could not be above eleven years         
old.                                                                        
  Having lived three years in this country, the reader I suppose            
will expect that I should, like other travelers, give him some account      
of the manners and customs of its inhabitants, which it was indeed          
my principal study to learn.                                                
  As these noble Houyhnhnms are endowed by nature with a general            
disposition to all virtues, and have no conceptions or ideas of what        
is evil in a rational creature, so their grand maxim is to cultivate        
reason, and to be wholly governed by it. Neither is reason among            
them a point problematical as with us, where men can argue with             
plausibility on both sides of the question; but strikes you with            
immediate conviction; as it must needs do where it is not mingled,          
obscured, or discolored by passion and interest. I remember it was          
with extreme difficulty that I could bring my master to understand the      
meaning of the word opinion, or how a point could be disputable;            
because reason taught us to affirm or deny only where we are                
certain, and beyond our knowledge we cannot do either. So that              
controversies, wranglings, disputes, and positiveness in false or           
dubious propositions, are evils unknown among the Houyhnhnms. In the        
like manner when I used to explain to him our several systems of            
natural philosophy, he would laugh that a creature pretending to            
reason should value itself upon the knowledge of other people's             
conjectures, and in things where that knowledge, if it were certain,        
could be of no use. Wherein he agreed entirely with the sentiments          
of Socrates, as Plato delivers them; which I mention as the highest         
honor I can do that prince of philosophers. I have often since              
reflected what destruction such a doctrine would make in the libraries      
of Europe, and how many paths to fame would be then shut up in the          
learned world.                                                              
  Friendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the        
Houyhnhnms, and these not confined to particular objects, but               
universal to the whole race. For a stranger from the remotest part          
is equally treated with the nearest neighbor, and wherever he goes          
looks upon himself as at home. They preserve decency and civility in        
the highest degrees, but are altogether ignorant of ceremony. They          
have no fondness for their colts or foals, but the care they take in        
educating them proceeds entirely from the dictates of reason. And I         
observed my master to show the same affection to his neighbor's             
issue that he had for his own. They will have it that nature teaches        
them to love the whole species, and it is reason only that makes a          
distinction of persons, where there is a superior degree of virtue.         
                                                    {P_4|CH_8 ^paragraph 10}
  When the matron Houyhnhnms have produced one of each sex, they no         
longer accompany with their consorts, except they lose one of their         
issue by some casualty, which very seldom happens; but in such a            
case they meet again; or when the like accident befalls a person whose      
wife is past bearing, some other couple bestow on him one of their own      
colts, and then go together again till the mother is pregnant. This         
caution is necessary to prevent the country from being overburdened         
with numbers. But the race of inferior Houyhnhnms bred up to be             
servants is not so strictly limited upon this article; these are            
allowed to produce three of each sex, to be domestics in the noble          
families.                                                                   
  In their marriages they are exactly careful to choose such colors as      
will not make any disagreeable mixture in the breed. Strength is            
chiefly valued in the male, and comeliness in the female; not upon the      
account of love, but to preserve the race from degenerating; for where      
a female happens to excel in strength, a consort is chosen with regard      
to comeliness. Courtship, love, presents, jointures, settlements, have      
no place in their thoughts, or terms whereby to express them in             
their language. The young couple meet and are joined, merely because        
it is the determination of their parents and friends: it is what            
they see done every day, and they look upon it as one of the necessary      
actions of a rational being. But the violation of marriage, or any          
other unchastity, was never heard of; and the married pair pass             
their lives with the same friendship and mutual benevolence that            
they bear to all others of the same species who come in their way;          
without jealousy, fondness, quarrelling, or discontent.                     
  In educating the youth of both sexes, their method is admirable, and      
highly deserves our imitation. These are not suffered to taste a grain      
of oats, except upon certain days, till eighteen years old; nor             
milk, but very rarely; and in summer they graze two hours in the            
morning, and as long in the evening, which their parents likewise           
observe; but the servants are not allowed above half that time, and         
a great part of their grass is brought home, which they eat at the          
most convenient hours, when they can be best spared from work.              
  Temperance, industry, exercise and cleanliness, are the lessons           
equally enjoined to the young ones of both sexes; and my master             
thought it monstrous in us to give the females a different kind of          
education from the males, except in some articles of domestic               
management; whereby, as he truly observed, one half of our natives          
were good for nothing but bringing children into the world; and to          
trust the care of our children to such useless animals, he said, was        
yet a greater instance of brutality.                                        
  But the Houyhnhnms train up their youth to strength, speed, and           
hardiness, by exercising them in running races up and down steep            
hills, and over hard stony grounds; and when they are all in a              
sweat, they are ordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or           
river. Four times a year the youth of a certain district meet to            
show their proficiency in running and leaping, and other feats of           
strength and agility; where the victor is rewarded with a song made in      
his or her praise. On this festival the servants drive a herd of            
Yahoos into the field, laden with hay and oats and milk, for a              
repast to the Houyhnhnms; after which these brutes are immediately          
driven back again, for fear of being noisome to the assembly.               
                                                    {P_4|CH_8 ^paragraph 15}
  Every fourth year, at the vernal equinox, there is a                      
representative council of the whole nation, which meets in a plain          
about twenty miles from our house, and continues about five or six          
days. Here they inquire into the state and condition of the several         
districts; whether they abound or be deficient in hay or oats, or cows      
or Yahoos. And wherever there is any want (which is seldom) it is           
immediately supplied by unanimous consent and contribution. Here            
likewise the regulation of children is settled: as for instance, if         
a Houyhnhnm has two males, he changes one of them with another that         
has two females; and when a child has been lost by any casualty, where      
the mother is past breeding, it is determined what family in the            
district shall breed another to supply the loss.                            
                                                                            
P_4|CH_9                                                                    
  CHAPTER IX                                                                
-                                                                           
  One of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three            
months before my departure, whither my master went as the                   
representative of our district. In this council was resumed their           
old debate, and indeed, the only debate which ever happened in that         
country; whereof my master after his return gave me a very                  
particular account.                                                         
  The question to be debated was whether the Yahoos should be               
exterminated from the face of the earth. One of the members for the         
affirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight,         
alleging that as the Yahoos were the most filthy, noisome, and              
deformed animal which nature ever produced, so they were the most           
restive and indocible, mischievous and malicious: they would privately      
suck the teats of the Houyhnhnms' cows, kill and devour their cats,         
trample down their oats and grass, if they were not continually             
watched, and commit a thousand other extravagancies. He took notice of      
a general tradition, that Yahoos had not been always in that                
country; but that many ages ago two of these brutes appeared                
together upon a mountain, whether produced by the heat of the sun upon      
corrupted mud and slime, or from the ooze and froth of the sea, was         
never known. That these Yahoos engendered, and their brood in a             
short time grew so numerous as to overrun and infest the whole nation.      
That the Houyhnhnms to get rid of this evil, made a general hunting,        
and at last enclosed the whole herd; and destroying the elder, every        
Houyhnhnm kept two young ones in a kennel, and brought them to such         
a degree of tameness, as an animal so savage by nature can be               
capable of acquiring; using them for draught and carriage. That             
there seemed to be much truth in this tradition, and that those             
creatures could not be Ylnhniamshy (or aborigines of the land),             
because of the violent hatred the Houyhnhnms, as well as all other          
animals, bore them; which although their evil disposition sufficiently      
deserved, could never have arrived at so high a degree, if they had         
been aborigines, or else they would have long since been rooted out.        
That the inhabitants taking a fancy to use the service of the               
Yahoos, had very imprudently neglected to cultivate the breed of            
asses, which were a comely animal, easily kept, more tame and orderly,      
without any offensive smell, strong enough for labor, although they         
yield to the other in agility of body; and if their braying be no           
agreeable sound, it is far preferable to the horrible howlings of           
the Yahoos.                                                                 
  Several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose, when        
my master proposed an expedient to the assembly, whereof he had indeed      
borrowed the hint from me. He approved of the tradition mentioned by        
the honorable member who spoke before, and affirmed that the two            
Yahoos said to be first seen among them had been driven there over the      
sea; that coming to land and being forsaken by their companions they        
retired to the mountains, and degenerating by degrees, became in            
process of time, much more savage than those of their own species in        
the country from where these two originals came. The reason of his          
assertion was that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful         
Yahoo (meaning myself), which most of them had heard of, and many of        
them had seen. He then related to them how he first found me; that          
my body was all covered with an artificial composure of the skins           
and hairs of other animals; that I spoke in a language of my own,           
and had thoroughly learned theirs; that I had related to him the            
accidents which brought me there; that when he saw me without my            
covering I was an exact Yahoo in every part, only of a whiter color,        
less hairy, and with shorter claws. He added how I had endeavored to        
persuade him that in my own and other countries the Yahoos acted as         
the governing, rational animal, and held the Houyhnhnms in                  
servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities of a Yahoo, only a      
little more civilized by some tincture of reason, which however was in      
a degree as far inferior to the Houyhnhnm race as the Yahoos of             
their country were to me; that among other things I mentioned a custom      
we had of castrating Houyhnhnms when they were young, in order to           
render them tame; that the operation was easy and safe; that it was no      
shame to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is taught by the ant,        
and building by the swallow. (For so I translate the word lyhannh,          
although it be a much larger fowl.) That this invention might be            
practiced upon the younger Yahoos here, which, besides rendering            
them tractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end to the        
whole species without destroying life. That in the meantime the             
Houyhnhnms should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses,              
which, as they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they            
have this advantage, to be fit for service at five years old, which         
the others are not till twelve.                                             
  This was all my master thought fit to tell me at that time of what        
passed in the grand council. But he was pleased to conceal one              
particular, which related personally to myself, whereof I soon felt         
the unhappy effect, as the reader will know in its proper place, and        
from which I date all the succeeding misfortunes of my life.                
  The Houyhnhnms have no letters, and consequently their knowledge          
is all traditional. But there happening few events of any moment among      
a people so well united, naturally disposed to every virtue, wholly         
governed by reason, and cut off from all commerce with other                
nations, the historical part is easily preserved without burdening          
their memories. I have already observed that they are subject to no         
diseases, and therefore can have no need of physicians. However,            
they have excellent medicines composed of herbs, to cure accidental         
bruises and cuts in the pastern or frog of the foot by sharp stones,        
as well as other maims and hurts in the several parts of the body.          
                                                     {P_4|CH_9 ^paragraph 5}
  They calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and the moon,        
but use no subdivisions into weeks. They are well enough acquainted         
with the motions of those two luminaries, and understand the nature of      
eclipses; and this is the utmost progress of their astronomy.               
  In poetry they must be allowed to excel all other mortals; wherein        
the justness of their similes, and the minuteness, as well as               
exactness of their descriptions, are indeed inimitable. Their verses        
abound very much in both of these, and usually contain either some          
exalted notions of friendship and benevolence, or the praises of those      
who were victors in races and other bodily exercises. Their buildings,      
although very rude and simple, are not inconvenient, but well               
contrived to defend them from all injuries of cold and heat. They have      
a kind of tree, which at forty years old loosens in the root, and           
falls with the first storm: they grow very straight, and being pointed      
like stakes with a sharp stone (for the Houyhnhnms know not the use of      
iron), they stick them erect in the ground about ten inches asunder,        
and then weave in oat straw, or sometimes wattles betwixt them. The         
roof is made after the same manner, and so are the doors.                   
  The Houyhnhnms use the hollow part between the pastern and the            
hoof of their fore feet as we do our hands, and this with greater           
dexterity than I could at first imagine. I have seen a white mare of        
our family thread a needle (which I lent her on purpose) with that          
joint. They milk their cows, reap their oats, and do all the work           
which requires hands, in the same manner. They have a kind of hard          
flints, which by grinding against other stones, they form into              
instruments, that serve instead of wedges, axes, and hammers. With          
tools made of these flints they likewise cut their hay and reap             
their oats, which there groweth naturally in several fields: the            
Yahoos draw home the sheaves in carriages, and the servants tread them      
in certain covered huts, to get out the grain, which is kept in             
stores. They make a rude kind of earthen and wooden vessels, and            
bake the former in the sun.                                                 
  If they can avoid casualties, they die only of old age, and are           
buried in the most obscure places that can be found, their friends and      
relations expressing neither joy nor grief at their departure; nor          
does the dying person discover the least regret that he is leaving the      
world, any more than if he were upon returning home from a visit to         
one of his neighbors. I remember my master having once made an              
appointment with a friend and his family to come to his house upon          
some affair of importance, on the day fixed the mistress and her two        
children came very late; she made two excuses, first for her                
husband, who, as she said, happened that very morning to shnuwnh.           
The word is strongly expressive in their language, but not easily           
rendered into English; it signifies, to retire to his first mother.         
Her excuse for not coming sooner was that her husband dying late in         
the morning, she was a good while consulting her servants about a           
convenient place where his body should be laid; and I observed she          
behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as the rest, and died about      
three months after.                                                         
  They live generally to seventy or seventy-five years, very seldom to      
fourscore: some weeks before their death they feel a gradual decay,         
but without pain. During this time they are much visited by their           
friends, because they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and            
satisfaction. However, about ten days before their death, which they        
seldom fail in computing, they return the visits that have been made        
them by those who are nearest in the neighborhood, being carried in         
a convenient sledge drawn by Yahoos; which vehicle they use, not            
only upon this occasion, but when they grow old, upon long journeys,        
or when they are lamed by any accident. And therefore when the dying        
Houyhnhnms return those visits, they take a solemn leave of their           
friends, as if they were going to some remote part of the country,          
where they designed to pass the rest of their lives.                        
                                                    {P_4|CH_9 ^paragraph 10}
  I know not whether it may be worth observing that the Houyhnhnms          
have no word in their language to express any thing that is evil,           
except what they borrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the        
Yahoos. Thus they denote the folly of a servant, an omission of a           
child, a stone that cuts their feet, a continuance of foul or               
unseasonable weather, and the like, by adding to each the epithet of        
Yahoo. For instance, Hhnm Yahoo, Whnaholm Yahoo, Ynlhmndwihlma Yahoo,       
and an ill-contrived house Ynholmhnmrohlnw Yahoo.                           
  I could with great pleasure enlarge further upon the manners and          
virtues of this excellent people; but intending in a short time to          
publish a volume by itself expressly upon that subject, I refer the         
reader there, and in the meantime, proceed to relate my own sad             
catastrophe,                                                                
                                                                            
P_4|CH_10                                                                   
  CHAPTER X                                                                 
-                                                                           
  I had settled my little economy to my own heart's content. My master      
had ordered a room to be made for me after their manner, about six          
yards from the house; the sides and floors of which I plastered with        
clay, and covered with rushmats of my own contriving; I had beaten          
hemp, which there grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this I      
filled with the feathers of several birds I had taken with springes         
made of Yahoos' hairs, and were excellent food. I had worked two            
chairs with my knife, the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and          
more laborious part. When my clothes were worn to rags, I made              
myself others with the skins of rabbits, and of a certain beautiful         
animal about the same size, called nnuhnoh, the skin of which is            
covered with a fine down. Of these I likewise made very tolerable           
stockings. I soled my shoes with wood which I cut from a tree and           
fitted to the upper leather, and when this was worn out, I supplied it      
with the skins of Yahoos dried in the sun. I often got honey out of         
hollow trees, which I mingled with water, or ate with my bread. No man      
could more verify the truth of these two maxims, That nature is very        
easily satisfied; and That necessity is the mother of invention. I          
enjoyed perfect health of body, and tranquillity of mind; I did not         
feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend, nor the injuries of a        
secret or open enemy. I had no occasion of bribing, flattering, or          
pimping to procure the favor of any great man or of his minion. I           
wanted no fence against fraud or oppression; here was neither               
physician to destroy my body, nor lawyer to ruin my fortune; no             
informer to watch my words and actions, or forge accusations against        
me for hire; here were no gibers, censurers, backbiters,                    
pickpockets, highwaymen, housebreakers, attorneys, bawds, buffoons,         
gamesters, politicians, wits, splenetics, tedious talkers,                  
controvertists, ravishers, murderers, robbers, virtuosos; no leaders        
or followers of party and faction; no encouragers to vice, by               
seducement or examples; no dungeon, axes, gibbets, whipping posts,          
or pillories; no cheating shopkeepers or mechanics; no pride,               
vanity, or affectation; no fops, bullies, drunkards, strolling whores,      
or poxes; no ranting, lewd, expensive wives; no stupid, proud pedants;      
no importunate, overbearing, quarrelsome, noisy, roaring, empty,            
conceited, swearing companions; no scoundrels, raised from the dust         
for the sake of their vices, or nobility thrown into it on account          
of their virtues: no lords, fiddlers, judges, or dancing masters.           
  I had the favor of being admitted to several Houyhnhnms, who came to      
visit or dine with my master; where his Honor graciously suffered me        
to wait in the room, and listen to their discourse. Both he and his         
company would often descend to ask me questions, and receive my             
answers. I had also sometimes the honor of attending my master in           
his visits to others. I never presumed to speak, except in answer to a      
question; and then I did it with inward regret, because it was a            
loss of so much time for improving myself; but I was infinitely             
delighted with the station of an humble auditor in such conversations,      
where nothing passed but what was useful, expressed in the fewest           
and most significant words; where the greatest decency was observed,        
without the least degree of ceremony; where no person spoke without         
being pleased himself, and pleasing his companions; where there was no      
interruption, tediousness, heat, or difference of sentiments. They          
have a notion that when people are met together, a silence does much        
improve conversation: this I found to be true; for during those little      
intermissions of talk, new ideas would arise in their thoughts,             
which very much enlivened the discourse. Their subjects are                 
generally on friendship and benevolence, or order and economy;              
sometimes upon the visible operations of nature, or ancient                 
traditions; upon the bounds and limits of virtue; upon the unerring         
rules of reason, or upon some determinations to be taken at the next        
great assembly; and often upon the various excellencies of poetry. I        
may add without vanity that my presence often gave them sufficient          
matter for discourse, because it afforded my master an occasion of          
letting his friends into the history of me and my country, upon             
which they were all pleased to descant in a manner not very                 
advantageous to human kind; and for that reason I shall not repeat          
what they said: only I may be allowed to observe that his Honor, to my      
great admiration, appeared to understand the nature of Yahoos in all        
countries much better than myself. He went through all our vices and        
follies, and discovered many which I had never mentioned to him, by         
only supposing what qualities a Yahoo of their country, with a small        
proportion of reason, might be capable of exerting; and concluded,          
with too much probability, how vile as well as miserable such a             
creature must be.                                                           
  I freely confess that all the little knowledge I have of any value        
was acquired by the lectures I received from my master, and from            
hearing the discourses of him and his friends; to which I should be         
prouder to listen than to dictate to the greatest and wisest                
assembly in Europe. I admired the strength, comeliness, and speed of        
the inhabitants; and such a constellation of virtues in such amiable        
persons produced in me the highest veneration. At first, indeed, I did      
not feel that natural awe which the Yahoos and all other animals            
bear towards them; but it grew upon me by degrees, much sooner than         
I imagined, and was mingled with a respectful love and gratitude, that      
they would condescend to distinguish me from the rest of my species.        
  When I thought of my family, my friends, my countrymen, or human          
race in general, I considered them as they really were, Yahoos in           
shape and disposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and                 
qualified with the gift of speech, but making no other use of reason        
than to improve and multiply those vices whereof their brethren in          
this country had only the share that nature allotted them. When I           
happened to behold the reflection of my own form in a lake or               
fountain, I turned away my face in horror and detestation of myself,        
and could better endure the sight of a common Yahoo than of my own          
person. By conversing with the Houyhnhnms, and looking upon them            
with delight, I fell to imitate their gait and gesture, which is now        
grown into an habit, and my friends often tell me in a blunt way, that      
I trot like a horse; which, however, I take for a great compliment.         
Neither shall I disown that in speaking I am apt to fall into the           
voice and manner of the Houyhnhnms, and hear myself ridiculed on            
that account without the least mortification.                               
  In the midst of all this happiness, and when I looked upon myself to      
be fully settled for life, my master sent for me one morning a              
little earlier than his usual hour. I observed by his countenance that      
he was in some perplexity, and at a loss how to begin what he had to        
speak. After a short silence he told me he did not know how I would         
take what he was going to say; that in the last general assembly, when      
the affair of the Yahoos was entered upon, the representatives had          
taken offense at his keeping a Yahoo (meaning myself) in his family         
more like a Houyhnhnm than a brute animal. That he was known                
frequently to converse with me, as if he could receive some                 
advantage or pleasure in my company; that such a practice was not           
agreeable to reason or nature, nor a thing ever heard of before             
among them. The assembly did therefore exhort him, either to employ me      
like the rest of my species, or command me to swim back to the place        
from where I came. That the first of these expedients was utterly           
rejected by all the Houyhnhnms who had ever seen me at his house or         
their own: for they alleged that because I had some rudiments of            
reason, added to the natural pravity of those animals, it was to be         
feared I might be able to seduce them into the woody and mountainous        
parts of the country, and bring them in troops by night to destroy the      
Houyhnhnms cattle, as being naturally of the ravenous kind, and averse      
from labor.                                                                 
                                                    {P_4|CH_10 ^paragraph 5}
  My master added that he was daily pressed by the Houyhnhnms of the        
neighborhood to have the assembly's exhortation executed, which he          
could not put off much longer. He doubted it would be impossible for        
me to swim to another country, and therefore wished I would contrive        
some sort of vehicle resembling those I had described to him, that          
might carry me on the sea; in which work I should have the                  
assistance of his own servants, as well as those of his neighbors.          
He concluded that for his own part he could have been content to            
keep me in his service as long as I lived; because he found I had           
cured myself of some bad habits and dispositions, by endeavoring, as        
far as my inferior nature was capable, to imitate the Houyhnhnms.           
  I should here observe to the reader, that a decree of the general         
assembly in this country is expressed by the word hnhloayn, which           
signifies an exhortation, as near as I can render it; for they have no      
conception how a rational creature can be compelled, but only               
advised or exhorted, because no person can disobey reason without           
giving up his claim to be a rational creature.                              
  I was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my master's             
discourse, and being unable to support the agonies I was under, I fell      
into a swoon at his feet; when I came to myself he told me that he          
concluded I had been dead (for these people are subject to no such          
imbecilities of nature). I answered in a faint voice that death             
would have been too great a happiness; that although I could not blame      
the assembly's exhortation, or the urgency of his friends, yet, in          
my weak and corrupt judgment, I thought it might consist with reason        
to have been less rigorous. That I could not swim a league, and             
probably the nearest land to theirs might be distant above a                
hundred; that many materials necessary for making a small vessel to         
carry me off, were wholly wanting in this country, which, however, I        
would attempt in obedience and gratitude to his Honor, although I           
concluded the thing to be impossible, and therefore looked on myself        
as already devoted to destruction. That the certain prospect of an          
unnatural death was the least of my evils; for supposing I should           
escape with life by some strange adventure, how could I think with          
temper of passing my days among Yahoos, and relapsing into my old           
corruptions, for want of examples to lead and keep me within the paths      
of virtue? That I knew too well upon what solid reasons all the             
determinations of the wise Houyhnhnms were founded, not to be shaken        
by arguments of mine, a miserable Yahoo; and therefore, after               
presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants'         
assistance in making a vessel, and desiring a reasonable time for so        
difficult a work, I told him I would endeavor to preserve a wretched        
being; and if ever I returned to England, was not without hopes of          
being useful to my own species by celebrating the praises of the            
renowned Houyhnhnms, and proposing their virtues to the imitation of        
mankind.                                                                    
  My master in a few words made me a very gracious reply, allowed me        
the space of two months to finish my boat; and ordered the sorrel nag,      
my fellow servant (for so this distance I may presume to call him)          
to follow my instructions, because I told my master that his help           
would be sufficient, and I knew he had a tenderness for me.                 
  In his company my first business was to go to that part of the coast      
where my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore. I got upon      
a height, and looking on every side into the sea, fancied I saw a           
small island towards the northeast: I took out my pocket-glass, and         
could then clearly distinguish it about five leagues off, as I              
computed; but it appeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud;        
for as he had no conception of any country beside his own, so he could      
not be as expert in distinguishing remote objects at sea as we who          
so much converse in that element.                                           
                                                   {P_4|CH_10 ^paragraph 10}
  After I had discovered this island, I considered no farther; but          
resolved it should, if possible, be the first place of my                   
banishment, leaving the consequence to fortune.                             
  I returned home, and consulting with the sorrel nag, we went into         
a copse at some distance, where I with my knife, and he with a sharp        
flint fastened very artificially after their manner to a wooden             
handle, cut down several oak wattles about the thickness of a               
walking-staff, and some larger pieces. But I shall not trouble the          
reader with a particular description of my own mechanics; let it            
suffice to say that in six weeks time, with the help of the sorrel          
nag, who performed the parts that required most labor, I finished a         
sort of Indian canoe, but much larger, covering it with the skins of        
Yahoos well stitched together, with hempen threads of my own making.        
My sail was likewise composed of the skins of the same animal; but I        
made use of the youngest I could get, the older being too tough and         
thick; and I likewise provided myself with four paddles. I laid in a        
stock of boiled flesh, of rabbits and fowls, and took with me two           
vessels, one fined with milk and the other with water.                      
  I tried my canoe in a large pond near my master's house, and then         
corrected in it what was amiss; stopping all the chinks with Yahoos'        
tallow, till I found it staunch, and able to bear me and my freight.        
And when it was as complete as I could possibly make it, I had it           
drawn on a carriage very gently by Yahoos to the seaside, under the         
conduct of the sorrel nag and another servant.                              
-                                                                           
  When all was ready, and the day came for my departure, I took             
leave of my master and lady and the whole family, my eyes flowing with      
tears, and my heart quite sunk with grief. But his Honor, out of            
curiosity, and perhaps (if I may speak it without vanity) partly out        
of kindness, was determined to see me in my canoe, and got several          
of his neighboring friends to accompany him. I was forced to wait           
above an hour for the tide, and then observing the wind very                
fortunately bearing towards the island to which I intended to steer my      
course, I took a second leave of my master; but as I was going to           
prostrate myself to kiss his hoof, he did me the honor to raise it          
gently to my mouth. I am not ignorant how much I have been censured         
for mentioning this last particular. For my detractors are pleased          
to think it improbable that so illustrious a person should descend          
to give so great a mark of distinction to a creature so inferior as I.      
Neither have I forgot how apt some travelers are to boast of                
extraordinary favors they have received. But if these censurers were        
better acquainted with the noble and courteous disposition of the           
Houyhnhnms, they would soon change their opinion.                           
                                                   {P_4|CH_10 ^paragraph 15}
  I paid my respects to the rest of the Houyhnhnms in his Honor's           
company; then getting into my canoe, I pushed off from shore.               
                                                                            
P_4|CH_11                                                                   
  CHAPTER XI                                                                
-                                                                           
  I began this desperate voyage on February 15, 1714-5, at 9 o'clock        
in the morning. The wind was very favorable; however, I made use at         
first only of my paddles; but considering I should soon be weary,           
and that the wind might chop about, I ventured set up my little             
sail; and thus with the help of the tide I went at the rate of a            
league and a half an hour, as near as I could guess. My master and his      
friends continued on the shore till I was almost out of sight; and I        
often heard the sorrel nag (who always loved me) crying out, Hnuy illa      
nyha majah Yahoo, Take care of thyself, gentle Yahoo.                       
  My design was, if possible, to discover some small island                 
uninhabited, yet sufficient by my labor to furnish me with the              
necessaries of life, which I would have thought a greater happiness         
than to be first minister in the politest court of Europe; so horrible      
was the idea I conceived of returning to live in the society and under      
the government of Yahoos. For in such a solitude as I desired I             
could at least enjoy my own thoughts, and reflect with delight on           
the virtues of those inimitable Houyhnhnms, without any opportunity of      
degenerating into the vices and corruptions of my own species.              
  The reader may remember what I related when my crew conspired             
against me and confined me to my cabin. How I continued there               
several weeks without knowing what course we took; and when I was           
put ashore in the long-boat, how the sailors told me with oaths,            
whether true or false, that not in what part of the world we were.          
However, I did then believe us to be about ten degrees southward of         
the Cape of Good Hope, or about 45'degrees souther latitude, as I           
gathered from some general words I overheard among them, being I            
supposed to the southeast in their intended voyage to Madagascar.           
And although this were but little better than conjecture, I resolved        
to steer my course eastward, hoping to reach the south-west coast of        
New Holland, and perhaps some such island as I desired, lying westward      
of it. The wind was full west, and by six in the evening I computed         
I had gone eastward at least eighteen leagues, when I spied a very          
small island about half a league off, which I soon reached. It was          
nothing but a rock, with one creek, naturally arched by the force of        
tempests. Here I put in my canoe, and climbing up a part of the             
rock, I could plainly discover land to the east, extending from             
south to north. I lay all night in my canoe; and repeating my voyage        
early in the morning, I arrived in seven hours to the south-east point      
of New Holland. This confirmed me in the opinion I have long                
entertained, that the maps and charts place this country at least           
three degrees more to the east than it really is; which thought I           
communicated many years ago to my worthy friend Mr. Herman Moll, and        
gave him my reasons for it, although he has rather chosen to follow         
other authors.                                                              
  I saw no inhabitants in the place where I landed, and being unarmed,      
I was afraid of venturing far into the country. I found some shellfish      
on the shore, and ate them raw, not daring to kindle a fire, for            
fear of being discovered by the natives. I continued three days             
feeding on oysters and limpets, to save my own provisions; and I            
fortunately found a brook of excellent water, which gave me great           
relief.                                                                     
  On the fourth day, venturing out early a little too far, I saw            
twenty or thirty natives upon a height, not above five hundred yards        
from me. They were stark naked, men, women, and children, round a           
fire, as I could discover by the smoke. One of them spied me, and gave      
notice to the rest; five of them advanced towards me, leaving the           
women and children at the fire. I made what haste I could to the            
shore, and getting into my canoe, shoved off: the savages observing me      
retreat, ran after me; and before I could get far enough into the sea,      
discharged an arrow, which wounded me deeply on the inside of my            
left knee (I shall carry the mark to my grave). I apprehended the           
arrow might be poisoned, and paddling out of the reach of their             
darts (being a calm day), I made a shift to suck the wound and dress        
it as well as I could.                                                      
                                                    {P_4|CH_11 ^paragraph 5}
  I was at a loss what to do, for I durst not return to the same            
landing-place, but stood to the north, and was forced to paddle; for        
the wind, though very gentle, was against me, blowing northwest. As         
I was looking about for a secure landing-place, I saw a sail to the         
north-northeast, which appearing every minute more visible, I was in        
some doubt whether I should wait for them or no; but at last my             
detestation of the Yahoo race prevailed, and turning my canoe, I            
sailed and paddled together to the south, and got into the same             
creek from whence I set out in the morning, choosing rather to trust        
myself among these barbarians, than live with European Yahoos. I            
drew up my canoe as close as I could to the shore, and hid myself           
behind a stone by the little brook, which, as I have already said, was      
excellent water.                                                            
  The ship came within half a league of this creek, and sent her            
long-boat with vessels to take in fresh water (for the place it             
seems was very well known), but I did not observe it till the boat was      
almost on shore, and it was too late to seek another hiding-place. The      
seamen at their landing observed my canoe, and rummaging it all             
over, easily conjectured that the owner could not be far off. Four          
of them well armed searched every cranny and lurking-hole, till at          
last they found me flat on my face behind the stone. They gazed awhile      
in admiration at my strange uncouth dress, my coat made of skins, my        
wooden-soled shoes, and my furred stockings; from whence, however,          
they concluded I was not a native of the place, who all go naked.           
One of the seamen in Portuguese bid me rise, and asked who I was. I         
understood that language very well, and getting upon feet, said I           
was a poor Yahoo, banished from the Houyhnhnms, and desired they would      
please to let me depart. They admired to hear me answer them in             
their own tongue, and saw by my complexion I must be a European, but        
were at a loss to know what I meant by Yahoos and Houyhnhnms, and at        
the same time fell a laughing at my strange tone in speaking, which         
resembled the neighing of a horse. I trembled all the while between         
fear and hatred: I again desired leave to depart, and was gently            
moving to my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know what         
country I was of, whence I came, with many other questions. I told          
them I was born in England, from whence I came about five years ago,        
and then their country and ours were at peace. I therefore hoped            
they would not treat me as an enemy, since I meant them no harm, but        
was a poor Yahoo, seeking some desolate place where to pass the             
remainder of his unfortunate life.                                          
  When they began to talk, I thought I never heard or saw any thing so      
unnatural; for it appeared to me as dog or a cow should speak in            
England, or a Yahoo in Houyhnhnm-land The honest Portuguese were            
equally amazed at my strange dress, and the odd manner of delivering        
my words, which however they understood very well. They spoke to me         
with great humanity, and said they were sure the Captain would carry        
me gratis to Lisbon, from whence I might return to my own country;          
that two of the seamen would go back to the ship, inform the Captain        
of what they had seen, and receive his order; in the mean time, unless      
I would give my solemn oath not to fly, they would secure me by force.      
I thought it best to comply with their proposal. They were very             
curious to know my story, but I gave them very little satisfaction;         
and they all conjectured my misfortunes had impaired my reason. In two      
hours the boat, which went laden with vessels of water, returned            
with the Captain's command to fetch me on board. I fell on my knees to      
preserve my liberty; but all was in vain, and the men having tied me        
with cords, heaved me into the boat, from whence I was taken into           
the ship, and from thence into the Captain's cabin.                         
  His name was Pedro de Mendez; he was a very courteous and generous        
person; he entreated me to give some account of myself, and desired to      
know what I would eat or drink; said I should be used as well as            
himself, and spoke so many obliging things, that I wondered to find         
such civilities from a Yahoo. However, I remained silent and sullen; I      
was ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men. At last I          
desired something to eat out of my own canoe; but he ordered me a           
chicken and some excellent wine, and then directed that I should be         
put to bed in a very clean cabin. I would not undress myself, but           
lay on the bed-clothes, and in half an hour stole out, when I               
thought the crew was at dinner, and getting to the side of the ship         
was going to leap into the sea, and swim for my life, rather than           
continue among Yahoos. But one of the seamen prevented me, and              
having informed the Captain, I was chained to my cabin.                     
  After dinner Don Pedro came to me, and desired to know my reason for      
so desperate an attempt, assured me he only meant to do me all the          
service he was able, and spoke so very movingly, that at last I             
descended to treat him like an animal which had some little portion of      
reason. I gave him a very short relation of my voyage, of the               
conspiracy against me by own men, of the country where they set me          
on shore, and of my three years residence there. All which he looked        
upon as if it were a dream or a vision; whereat I took great                
offense, for I had quite forgotten the faculty of lying, so peculiar        
to Yahoos in all countries where they preside, and, consequently the        
disposition of suspecting truth in others of their own I asked him          
whether it were the custom in his country to say the thing that was         
not. I assured him I had almost forgotten what he meant by                  
falsehood, and if I had lived a thousand years in Houyhnhnm-land, I         
should never have heard a lie from the meanest servant, that I was          
altogether indifferent whether he believed me or not, but however,          
in return for his favors, I would give so much allowance to the             
corruption of his nature as to answer any objection he would please to      
make, and then he might easily discover the truth.                          
                                                   {P_4|CH_11 ^paragraph 10}
  The Captain, a wise man, after many endeavors to catch me tripping        
in some part of my story, at last began to have a better opinion of my      
veracity, and the rather, because he confessed he met with a Dutch          
skipper, who pretended to have landed with five others of his crew          
upon a certain island or continent south of New Holland, where they         
went for fresh water, and observed a horse driving before him               
several animals exactly resembling those I described under the name of      
Yahoos, with some other particulars, which the Captain said he had          
forgotten; because he then concluded them all to be lies. But he added      
that since I professed so inviolable an attachment to truth, I must         
give him my word of honor to bear him company in this voyage,               
without attempting any thing against my life, or else he would              
continue me a prisoner till we arrived at Lisbon. I gave him the            
promise he required, but at the same time protested that I would            
suffer the greatest hardships rather than return to live among Yahoos.      
  Our voyage passed without any considerable accident. In gratitude to      
the Captain I sometimes sat with him at his earnest request, and            
strove to conceal my antipathy to human kind, although it often             
broke out, which he suffered to pass without observation. But the           
greatest part of the day I confined myself to my cabin, to avoid            
seeing any of the crew. The Captain had often entreated me to strip         
myself of my savage dress, and offered to lend me the best suit of          
clothes he had. This I would not be prevailed on to accept,                 
abhorring to cover myself with any thing that had been on the back          
of a Yahoo. I only desired he would lend me two clean shirts, which         
having been washed since he wore them, I believed would not so much         
defile me. These I changed every second day, and washed them myself.        
  We arrived at Lisbon, Nov. 5, 1715. At our landing the Captain            
forced me to cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from        
crowding about me. I was conveyed to his own house, and at my               
earnest request he led me up to the highest room backwards. I conjured      
him to conceal from all persons what I had told him of the Houyhnhnms,      
because the least hint of such a story would not only draw numbers          
of people to see me, but probably put me in danger of being                 
imprisoned, or burned by the Inquisition. The Captain persuaded me          
to accept a suit of clothes newly made; but I would not suffer the          
tailor to take my measure; however, Don Pedro being almost of my size,      
they fitted me well enough. He accoutred me with other necessaries all      
new, which I aired for twenty-four hours before I would use them.           
  The Captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which          
were suffered to attend at meals, and his whole deportment was so           
obliging, added to very good human understanding, that I really             
began to tolerate his company. He gained so far upon me that I              
ventured to look out of the back window. By degrees I was brought into      
another room, from whence I peeped into the street, but drew my head        
back in a fright. In a week's time he seduced me down to the door. I        
found my terror gradually lessened, but my hatred and contempt              
seemed to increase. I was at last bold enough to walk the street in         
his company, but kept my nose well stopped with rue, or sometimes with      
tobacco.                                                                    
  In ten days Don Pedro, to whom I had given some account of my             
domestic affairs, put it upon me as a matter of honor and                   
conscience, that I ought to return to my native country, and live at        
home with my wife and children. He told me there was an English ship        
in the port just ready to sail, and he would furnish me with all            
things necessary. It would be tedious to repeat his arguments, and          
my contradictions. He said it was altogether impossible to find such a      
solitary island as I had desired to live in; but I might command in my      
own house, and pass my time in a manner as recluse as I pleased.            
                                                   {P_4|CH_11 ^paragraph 15}
  I complied at last, finding I could not do better. I left Lisbon the      
24th day of November, in an English merchantman, but who was the            
master I never inquired. Don Pedro accompanied me to the ship, and          
lent me twenty pounds. He took kind leave of me, and embraced me at         
parting, which I bore as well as I could. During this last voyage I         
had no commerce with the master or any of his men; but pretending I         
was sick, kept close in my cabin. On the fifth of December, 1715, we        
cast anchor in the Downs about nine in the morning, and at three in         
the afternoon I got safe to my house at Rotherhith.                         
  My wife and family received me with great surprise and joy,               
because they concluded me certainly dead; but I must freely confess         
the sight of them filled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt,        
and the more by reflecting on the near alliance I had to them. For          
although since my unfortunate exile from the Houyhnhnm country, I           
had compelled myself to tolerate the sight of Yahoos, and to                
converse with Don Pedro de Mendez, yet my memory and imagination            
were perpetually filled with the virtues and ideas of those exalted         
Houyhnhnms. And when I began to consider that by copulating with one        
of the Yahoo species I had become a parent of more, it struck me            
with the utmost shame, confusion, and horror.                               
  As soon as I entered the house, my wife took me in her arms and           
kissed me, at which, having not been used to the touch of that              
odious animal for so many years, I fell in a swoon for almost an hour.      
At the time I am writing it is five years since my last return to           
England: during the first year I could not endure my wife or                
children in my presence, the very smell of them was intolerable,            
much less could I suffer them to eat in the same room. To this hour         
they dare not presume to touch my bread, or drink out of the same cup,      
neither was I ever able to let one of them take me by the hand. The         
first money I laid out was to buy two young stone-horses, which I keep      
in a good stable, and next to them the groom is my greatest                 
favorite; for I feel my spirits revived by the smell he contracts in        
the stable. My horses understand me tolerably well; I converse with         
them at least four hours every day. They are strangers to bridle or         
saddle; they live in great amity with me, and friendship to each            
other.

  CHAPTER XII                                                               
-                                                                           
  Thus, gentle reader, I have given thee faithful history of my             
travels for sixteen years and above seven months; wherein I have not        
been so studious of ornament as truth. I could perhaps like others          
have astonished you with strange improbable tales; but I rather             
chose to relate plain matter of fact in the simplest manner and style;      
because my principal design was to inform, and not to amuse you.            
  It is easy for us who travel into remote countries, which are seldom      
visited by Englishmen or other Europeans, to form descriptions of           
wonderful animals both at sea and land. Whereas a traveler's chief aim      
should be to make men wiser and better, and to improve their minds          
by the bad as well as good example of what they deliver concerning          
foreign places.                                                             
  I could heartily wish a law was enacted, that every traveler, before      
he were permitted to publish his voyages, should be obliged to make         
oath before the Lord High Chancellor that all he intended to print was      
absolutely true to the best of his knowledge; for then the world would      
no longer be deceived as it usually is, while some writers, to make         
their works pass the better upon the public, impose the grossest            
falsities on the unwary reader. I have perused several books of             
travels with great delight in my younger days; but having since gone        
over most parts of the globe, and been able to contradict many              
fabulous accounts from my own observation, it has given me a great          
disgust against this part of reading, and some indignation to see           
the credulity of mankind so impudently abused. Therefore since my           
acquaintances were pleased to think my poor endeavors might not be          
unacceptable to my country, I imposed on myself as a maxim, never to        
be swerved from, that I would strictly adhere to truth; neither indeed      
can I be ever under the least temptation to vary from it, while I           
retain in my mind the lectures and example of my noble master, and the      
other illustrious Houyhnhnms, of whom I had so long the honor to be         
a humble bearer.                                                            
-                                                                           
      ---Nec si miserum Fortuna Sinonem

-                                                                           
  I know very well how little reputation is to be gotten by writings        
which require neither genius nor learning, nor indeed any other             
talent, except a good memory or an exact journal. I know likewise that      
writers of travels, like dictionary-makers, are sunk into oblivion          
by the weight and bulk of those who come after, and therefore lie           
uppermost. And it is highly probable that such travelers who shall          
hereafter visit the countries described in this work of mine, may,          
by detecting my errors (if there be any), and adding many new               
discoveries of their own, jostle me out of vogue, and stand in my           
place, making the world forget that I was ever an author. This              
indeed would be too great a mortification if I wrote for fame: but, as      
my sole intention was the PUBLIC GOOD, I cannot be altogether               
disappointed. For who can read of the virtues I have mentioned in           
the glorious Houyhnhnms, without being ashamed of his own vices,            
when he considers himself as the reasoning, governing animal of his         
country? I shall say nothing of those remote nations where Yahoos           
preside; amongst which the least corrupted are the Brobdingnagians,         
whose wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness      
to observe. But I forbear descanting farther, and rather leave the          
judicious reader to own remarks and applications.                           
  I am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet        
with no censurers: for what objections can be made against a writer         
who relates only plain facts that happened in such distant                  
countries, where we have not the least interest with respect either to      
trade or negotiations? I have carefully avoided every fault with which      
common writers of travels are often too justly charged. Besides, I          
meddle not the least with any party, but write without passion,             
prejudice, or illwill against any man or number of men whatsoever. I        
write for the noblest end, to inform and instruct mankind, over whom I      
may, without breach of modesty, pretend to some superiority, from           
the advantages I received by conversing so long among the most              
accomplished Houyhnhnms. I write without any view towards profit or         
praise. I never suffer a word to pass that may look like reflection,        
or possibly give the least offence even to those who are most ready to      
take it. So that I hope I may with justice pronounce myself an              
author perfectly blameless, against whom the tribes of answerers,           
considerers, observers, reflecters, detecters, remarkers, will never        
be able to find matter for exercising their talents.                        
  I confess it was whispered to me that I was bound in duty as a            
subject of England to have given in a memorial to a Secretary of State      
at my first coming over; because whatever lands are discovered by a         
subject belong to the Crown. But I doubt whether our conquests in           
the countries I treat of, would be as easy as those of Ferdinando           
Cortez over the naked Americans. The Lilliputians I think are hardly        
worth the charge of a fleet and army to reduce them; and I question         
whether it might be prudent or safe to attempt the Brobdingnagians; or      
whether an English army would be much at their ease with the Flying         
Island over their heads. The Houyhnhnms, indeed, appear not to be so        
well prepared for war, a science to which they are perfect                  
strangers, and especially against missive weapons. However,                 
supposing myself to be a minister of state, I could never give my           
advice for invading them. Their prudence, unanimity,                        
unacquaintedness with fear, and their love of their country, would          
amply supply all defects in the military art. Imagine twenty                
thousand of them breaking into the midst of a European army,                
confounding the confounding the ranks, overturning the carriages,           
battering the warriors' faces into mummy by terrible yerks from             
their hinder hoofs. For they would well deserve the character given to      
Augustus: Recalcitrat unclique tutus. But instead of proposals for          
conquering that magnanimous nation, I rather wish they were in a            
capacity or disposition to send a number of their inhabitants for           
civilizing Europe, by teaching us the first principles of honor,            
truth, temperance, public spirit, fortitude, chastity, benevolence,         
and fidelity. The names of all which virtues are still retained             
among us in languages, and are to be met with in modern as well as          
ancient which I am able to assert from my own small reading.                
                                                   {P_4|CH_12 ^paragraph 10}
  But I had another reason which made me less forward to enlarge his        
Majesty's dominions by my discoveries. To say the truth, I had              
conceived a few scruples with relation to the distributive justice          
of princes upon those occasions. For instance, a crew of pirates are        
driven by a storm they know not whither, at length a boy discovers          
land from the topmast, they go on shore to rob and plunder, they see a      
harmless people, are entertained with kindness, they give the               
country a new name, they take formal possession of it for their             
King, they set up a rotten plank or a stone for a memorial, they            
murder two or three dozen of the natives, bring away a couple more          
by force for a sample, return home, and get their pardon. Here              
commences a new dominion acquired with a title by divine right.             
Ships are sent with the first opportunity, the natives driven out or        
destroyed, their princes tortured to discover their gold, a free            
license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust, the earth reeking         
with the blood of its inhabitants: and this execrable crew of butchers      
employed in so pious an expedition, is a modern colony sent to convert      
and civilize an idolatrous and barbarous people.                            
  But this description, I confess, does by no means affect the British      
nation, who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom,          
care, and justice in planting colonies; their liberal endowments for        
the advancement of religion and learning; their choice of devout and        
able pastors to propagate Christianity; their caution in stocking           
their provinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this      
the mother kingdom; their strict regard to the distribution of              
justice, in supplying the civil administration through all their            
colonies with officers of the greatest abilities, utter strangers to        
corruption; and to crown all, by sending the most vigilant and              
virtuous governors, who have no other views than the happiness of           
the people over whom they preside, and the honor of the King their          
master.                                                                     
  But, as those countries which I have described do not appear to have      
any desire of being conquered, and enslaved, murdered or driven out by      
colonies, nor abound either in gold, silver, sugar, or tobacco; I           
did humbly conceive they were by no means proper objects of our             
zeal, our valor, or our interest. However, if those whom it more            
concerns think fit to be of another opinion, I am ready to depose,          
when I shall be lawfully called, that no European did ever visit these      
countries before me. I mean, if the inhabitants ought to he                 
believed; unless a dispute may arise about the two Yahoos, said to          
have been seen many ages ago in a mountain in Houyhnhnm-land, from          
whence the opinion is, that the race of those brutes has descended;         
and these, for anything I know, may have been English, which indeed         
I was apt to suspect from the lineaments of their posterity's               
countenances, although very much defaced. But, how far that will go to      
make out a title, I leave to the learned in colony-law.                     
  But as to the formality of taking possession in my Sovereign's name,      
it never came once into my thoughts; and if it had, yet as my               
affairs then stood, I should perhaps in point of prudence and               
self-preservation have put it off to a better opportunity.                  
  Having thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised           
against me as a traveler, I here take a final leave of all my               
courteous readers, and return to enjoy my own speculations in my            
little garden at Redriff, to apply those excellent lessons of virtue        
which I learned among the Houyhnhnms, to instruct the Yahoos of my own      
family as far as I shall find them docile animals; to behold my figure      
often in a glass, and thus if possible habituate myself by time to          
tolerate the sight of a human creature; to lament the brutality of          
Houyhnhnms in my own country, but always treat their persons with           
respect, for the sake of my noble master, his family, his friends, and      
the whole Houyhnhnm race, whom these ours have the honor to resemble        
in all their lineaments, however their intellectuals came to                
degenerate.                                                                 
                                                   {P_4|CH_12 ^paragraph 15}
  I began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me, at the      
farthest end of a long table, and to answer (but with the utmost            
brevity) the few questions I ask her. Yet the smell of a Yahoo              
continuing very offensive, I always keep my nose well stopped with          
rue, lavender, or tobacco leaves. And although it be hard for a man         
late in life to remove old habits, I am not altogether out of hopes in      
some time to suffer a neighbor Yahoo in my company, without the             
apprehensions I am yet under of his teeth or his claws.                     
  My reconcilement to the Yahoo-kind in general might not be so             
difficult, if they would be content with those vices and follies            
only which nature has entitled them to. I am not in the least provoked      
at the sight of a lawyer, a pick-pocket, a colonel, a fool, a lord,         
a gamester, a politician, a whore-master, a physician, an evidence,         
a suborner, an attorney, a traitor, or the like; this is all according      
to the due course of things: but when I behold a lump of deformity and      
diseases both in body and mind, smitten with pride, it immediately          
breaks all the measures of my patience; neither shall I be ever able        
to comprehend how such an animal and such a vice could tally together.      
The wise and virtuous Houyhnhnms, who abound in all excellencies            
that can adorn a rational creature, have no name for this vice in           
their language, which has no terms to express anything that is evil,        
except those whereby they describe the detestable qualities of their        
Yahoos, among which they were not able to distinguish this of pride,        
for want of thoroughly understanding human nature, as it shows              
itself in other countries, where that animal presides. But I, who           
had more experience, could plainly observe some rudiments of it             
among the wild Yahoos.                                                      
  But the Houyhnhnms, who live under the government of reason, are          
no more proud of the good qualities they possess, than I should be for      
not wanting a leg or an arm, which no man in his wits would boast           
of, although he must be miserable without them. I dwell the longer          
upon this subject from the desire I have to make the society of an          
English Yahoo by any means not insupportable; and therefore I here          
entreat those who have any tincture of this absurd vice, that they          
will not presume to come in my sight.                                       
-                                                                           
                             THE END

                    THE WOLF AND THE CRANE

   Once upon a time . . . a wolf well known for his ferocity received his 
punishment for being greedy. As he was devouring a lamb, a tiny sharp bone 
stuck in his throat. And from that day on, he could swallow nothing except 
sips of water, which neither soothed the pain nor appeased his hunger. Though 
he tried every remedy he knew, he was unable to dislodge the bone. In despair,
he started to ask everyone he knew for help. But, scared of his awful 
reputation, folk made excuses to avoid the wolf and would have nothing to do 
with him. One day, from behind his barred door, the fox said: "I'm not well, 
so I can't open the door, but I think you ought to have a word with the crane 
down at the end of the big pond. Folk say she's the best doctor around here.
   Without much hope and feeling sorry for himself, the wolf went to see the 
crane. And when he got to her house, he tried his best to be pleasant.
   "Mrs Crane, I'm told you're enormously clever. If you can help me, I'll 
give you a rich reward!"
   At first, the crane, well aware of the wolf's reputation, was alarmed, 
though also proud at the idea of treating such a famous patient. And, 
attracted too by the promise of a reward, she said she'd see what she could 
do.
   The wolf opened wide his huge mouth. The crane shuddered at the thought of
peering inside the red jaws with their sharp fangs, but plucking up her 
courage, she said: "Now, please keep your mouth wide open, or I won't be able 
to remove the bone!" And she poked her long beak down the wolf's throat and 
pulled out the little bone.
   "There! You can close your mouth again. You'll be able to swallow whatever 
you like now!" The wolf could hardly believe it. His throat was clear at last!
Highly delighted, the crane said: "See how clever I am? You didn't feel a 
thing! I whipped out that nasty bone with my long beak! And as for my 
reward..." The wolf interrupted with a scowl.
   "Reward? What reward? You ought to be grateful that I didn't bite your head
off while it was down my throat! You should give me a reward for sparing your 
life!"
   Seeing the wolf's bloodshot eyes, the crane realized she was now in danger.
What more could she expect from such a wicked wolf? And she vowed that, from 
then on, she'd only treat patients too harmless ever to threaten her.

                       THE SNOW MAIDEN

   Once upon a time there was a beautiful garden which became even more
beautiful that day, after a heavy fall of snow covered the ground, the trees
and bushes in a soft white mantle. A little boy and girl were playing happily
in the garden, they were brother and sister.
   They chased each other, threw snowballs and played hide and seek under the 
fir trees. Then the little girl said,
   "Let's make a snow doll."
   They began to make a snow doll and decided it would be a girl.
   "So there will be three of us and we'll have more fun!" said the little 
girl. So they carefully built a doll made of snow, with a pretty oval face, 
long hair, large eyes and a delicate little mouth. It looked just like a real
little girl.
   "Let's give her a kiss and maybe her lips will turn red like ours," said the
sister. So they kissed the doll... and lo and behold, its lips turned red!
   And the snow doll's cheeks turned pink. When a sudden gust of wind blew from
the north, the doll came to life. It moved, smiled at the two children and
started to play with them.
   Some time later, the children's father returned from town. When he saw the
girl in white playing with his own children, he said to himself,
   "It must be one of the neighbour's daughters." Then he said to the little
snow doll, "Come into the house and get warm." But the snow maiden made a 
frightened sign as though to say "No!" The man, however led her into the house,
saying,
   "Oh, you're so cold! The fire will soon warm you up!" But the snow maiden
sighed sadly, though she didn't have the courage to speak. In she went and
stood by the window, looking out at the white garden. Then she began to wep -
as slowly and gently, she began to melt... until nothing was left of her except
a trace of white snow on the floor...

                    THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN KIDS

   Once upon a time . . . a Mother Goat lived in a pretty little house with
her seven kids. Mother often had to leave home to do the shopping, and on that
fateful day, she had given her children the usual warnings, before setting off
to market.
   "You mustn't open the door to anyone. Don't forget, there's a wicked wolf
lurking about here. It's black, with horrible paws and a nasty deep voice. If
it knocks, keep the door tightly shut!" Mother Goat's words were wise indeed,
for as she was telling one of her neighbours about her fears, the wolf
disguised as a peasant was hiding close by, listening to every word.
   "Good! Very good!" said the wolf to himself."If the goat goes market, I'II
drop by her house and gobble the kids!' Then,trying not to look too 
conspicuous, the wolf hurried along to the goat's house. There, he threw off
his disguise. He then growled in a deep voice: "Open the door! Open the door!
It's Mother! I've just come back from market! Open the door!" When the kids
heard the deep voice, they remembered their mother's warning. From behind the
barred door, they said to the wolf: "We know who you are! You're the wolf! Our
mother has a sweet gentle voice, not a deep nasty one like yours! Go away! 
We'll never open the door to you!"
   And though the wolf banged furiously on the door, the kids, though
trembling with terror, refused to let him into the house, and so the door
remained shut. Then the wolf had a brainwave. He dashed off to the baker's and
got a big cake dripping with honey. He hoped this would sweeten his voice. And
in fact, after eating it, his voice didn't sound quite so deep. Over and over
again, he practised imitating Mother Goat's voice. You see, he'd heard it in
the woods. When he felt certain he could easily be mistaken for Mother Goat
herself, he rushed back to the house and the seven kids.
   "Open the door! Open the door! It's Mother! I've just come back from
market! Open the door!" he called. This time, the kids had doubts: the voice
did rather sound like mother's, and they were about to unlock the door, when 
the black kid suspiciously cried: "Mother, let us see your foot!" Without
thinking, the wolf raised a black hairy paw. And the kids knew that the wolf
had come back.
   "You're not our mother! She doesn't have horrid black paws!" cried the
kids. "Go away, you wicked wolf!"
   And once more, in spite of all his hard work, the wolf found the door
locked against him. The wolf ran down to the mlll, and found a sack of flour. 
He thrust his paws into it until they were pure white.
   "I'll trick them this time," he said. "Mmm! My mouth's watering already!
I'm hungry! My tummy's empty and my trousers are falling off! I'll swallow
these tender kids whole!" Again he knocked on the door. 
   "Open the door! Open the door! It's Mother! I've just come back from
market! Open the door!" The voice seemed exactly like mother's, but the wary
kids quickly called out: "Mother, let us see your foot!" The wily wolf lifted
a snow white paw, and the kids, now reassured, threw open the door. What a
shock they received! An enormous set of jaws with sharp fangs growled 
fiercely. Cruel claws reached out for their prey. The kids scattered in
terror. One dived under the table, while other crawled below the bed. Another 
kid hid in the cupboard and one tried to hide in the oven, though the stove
was still hot. One kid crouched inside a barrel and one hid in the grandfather
clock. There he huddled, holding his breath, as the wolf hunted down his 
brothers. One by one, the kids were pulled from their hiding places. All 
except for the kid in the clock. The wicked wolf's appetite did not pass until
he had found them and swallowed each in a single gulp.
   The only one to escape was the little black kid, for the wolf never 
imagined that there was room for a kid inside the very narrow grandfather 
clock. In the meantime, Mother Goat had really come back from market.  When, 
from a distance, she noticed that the door was ajar, she rushed home, her 
heart in her mouth. She had a sinking feeling: what she feared had really 
happened. The wicked wolf had gobbled up all her children. She dropped into a 
chair, sobbing bitterly, but as she cried, the door of the grandfather clock 
swung open and out ran the black kid.
   "Mummy! Mummy!" wept the kid. "It was terrible! The wolf came, and I think 
he's eaten all my brothers!"
   "My poor child!" sobbed Mother Goat. "You're the only one left! That evil 
brute has gobbled them all!"
   Not long after, Mother Goat and her son left the house to take a stroll in 
the garden. Suddenly, she heard a low wheezing sound: someone was snoring 
heavily. It was the greedy wolf. His feast of kids had been too much for him 
and he was fast asleep, dead to the world. In a flash, Mother Goat had a 
brainwave. She said to her son: "Run and fetch me a needle and thread and a 
pair of scissors!" With these, she swiftly slit open the wolf's stomach. As 
she had hoped, the ravenous brute had swallowed every kid whole. There they 
were all stlll alive alive inside his tummy. One by one, out they popped from
the wolf's tummy.
   "Hurry! Hurry! Not a sound! We must get away before he wakens up! Wait!
Fetch me a heap of stones!" And so they filled the wolf's stomach with stones
and stitched it up again. The wolf woke later with a raging thirst.
   "What a heavy tummy I have!" he said. "I've eaten too much! All these 
kids!" But when he went down the river to drink, his tummy full of stones 
tipped him over and he fell into the water. The weight took him straight to 
the bottom, and the goat and her kids shrieked with joy as he sank. The 
wicked wolf was dead and the kids trotted home happily with Mother.

MATRIARCHAL SHEPHERD   
  by Marc Edwards

  She gazed out her third-floor apartment window and saw simpler times. 

  After the economic upturn following the Great Depression, the 
streets were hand-laid with red brick and flanked by hardwood trees. 
The surplus brick was used to build storefronts, houses, and apartment 
buildings. Flowers, adorning the shiny storefronts, could be seen and 
smelled. The sidewalks, always busy, were filled with peoples. Her 
neighborhood had seen many changes over the years; some said too many.

  Because of the area's economic growth, the neighborhood became a 
community. People flocked to this mecca of renewed hope; took jobs, 
bought homes, and raised families. The bustling community evolved into 
a city; the city into a major metropolis, and everywhere you looked -- 
signs of rapid growth and prosperity.

  That was then; this is now.

  She gazed out her third-floor apartment window and finished a silent 
prayer -- she sighed. Tons of asphalt cover those same red brick streets, 
and the trees not paved over are dead and gone. Flowers. What flowers?
dandelions and other weeds emerge from cracks in the asphalt. A large 
portion of the population had moved away, many businesses with them, and 
the city has been reduced. Nearly all the buildings remain, most skeletons 
of their former selves blankly staring at you through shattered windows, 
many, abandoned for years. The people who still inhabit the area fall into 
two categories: the sheep and the wolves.

  Martha is one of these.

  "I've lived in this neighborhood most my life," she was fond of
telling everyone. "Worked here, raised a family, and made life-long
friends."

  Her youngest daughter asked, "Momma, why don't you move in with us? 
You don"t need to stay alone in this big old building. Come live with us, 
please?"

  Martha's reply was gentle but firm. "Why, Liz'beth, you know I can't
do that; your daddy wouldn't hear of it."

  "Momma," Elizabeth reminded her, "Daddy's dead, remember?"

  "Just his body, dear, not his *soul*," Martha replied, her eyes
glistening with confidence and happiness at the mention of her husband.

  Each of her five children made the same request, repeatedly. She 
addressed them on each occasion, tenderly explaining her decision to 
stay. So convincing was her magic all gave up on suggesting she move 
out of her long time home. Instead, they respected her independence, 
and telephoned and visited "Gramma" with their children regularly.

                              *  *  *

  About fifteen years before his demise, Martha and her husband Lyle
had arranged to buy the apartment house. "It's a lovely old buildin',"
he told her, "as long as you and me are here, she'll hold together. It'll 
be our little paradise." The same day they signed the papers, they made 
that a promise to themselves and a solemn oath before God. And they agreed,
mutually, the promise would never be broken.

  Years later -- only a day before his death -- Lyle told Martha, "Passin'
-on ain't no reason for sorrow. When I shed this old body, I don't want no 
cryin'. It ain't fittin' for people to be cryin' at a party."

  Nearly two hundred people attended Lyle's funeral, which didn't 
resemble a conventional funeral at all. Would be mourners -- friends and 
family alike -- were treated to a Dixieland style wake, complete with 
five-piece brass ensemble, a feast, and liquor. Two days later, the last 
of the family and friends left to resume their lives. In keeping with his 
wishes, his empty husk was cremated and placed in a simple urn. He found 
an eternal resting place on the mantle in their apartment. Martha turned 
the mantle into a shrine -- dedicated to his memory -- replacing J.F.K. 

  Martha was then on her own; serving as matriarch to the family and the
apartment house. From the beginning of the Jennings apartments, Martha
had been manager, super, surrogate parent, and defender of all persons
housed there. On a first-name basis with adults and children alike, she
made it her business to do all she could for every man, woman, and child
that resided there.
              
  The living arrangements in Jennings House -- like Lyle's going-away 
party -- was unique. Without imposing herself or her values on anyone, 
she collected rent, saw to repairs, and negotiated contracts. Everyone 
living there came to appreciate Martha Jennings as a saint. When money 
was tight, Martha waited patiently for the rent. Occasionally, she excused 
the payment altogether. She would often sit children for harried parents 
when regular sitters were inconveniently unavailable. And when families 
would move on to homes of their own, she met another proviso of her and 
Lyle's pact:

  She gathered the extended family of the house, threw a goodbye party, 
and secretly tucked the deposit money and a rebate of one-months rent into 
a thank you card. This token of generosity was often discovered by the 
recipient, and when they tried to return the gift, "My mind's made up," 
she would say, beaming with glee. "I want you kids to be happy where 
you're going. If you won't keep it, give it to the Lord and your church."

  These gestures of cash gifts were one of the reasons the wolves soon 
flocked to Jennings House. The violence of the streets drew near.

  "Martha, we gotta take care." cautioned Bill Hanson, a downstairs
tenant. "Johnson's Grocery -- down the street -- was robbed last night."

  "Now Bill, don't you worry," she said, sipping tea in his living room.
"The Lord is our shepherd and He's watchin' out for us."

  Bill's face was etched with fear, as he informed her, "I called the 
police today, and they told me they'd step-up patrols going through the 
neighborhood for the next few nights. But, ain't much more they can do."

  "Don't you fret 'bout it," Martha said to calm him. "The Lord is in
this house, and He will provide and care for us."
           
  That same evening, Bill invited the other adult house-members to his
apartment to discuss their situation. An hour later, Martha joined them. 
Although not intending to circumvent her, most of them felt shame in 
leaving her out of this discussion. "I'm sorry, Martha. I didn't mean any 
disrespect, but I don't think you're taking this serious enough," Bill 
explained.

  "I'm not slighted, dear. But, I told you earlier, the Lord is in this 
house. He won't allow us to come to harm."

  Martha encouraged them to discuss it. "Get it all out in the open,"
she said. So they did. 

  "The situation with the gangs is just getting' worse," Bill remarked.

  "We're sittin' ducks," muttered another.

  "Two weeks ago I installed double dead-bolts on my door. I'm scared
for the first time since I moved here. And I don't let the children play 
outside unless some of us are out there too," replied Evelyn, who lived
on the second-floor.

  "I think we should form a neighborhood watch," countered Bill, "and be
prepared to call the police at the first sign of trouble."

  "I just want my babies to be safe! What happens to us if those . . .
*those damned* . . ." Evelyn's words broke off in mid-sentence; in tears
she buried her face in her husband's comforting arms.

  "I have a gun," Bill said blankly.

  "Folks, we've known each other a lotta' years," Martha said, "and I
know we never told you no guns." She crossed the room and opened the 
door, standing in the doorway she added, "I've listened to you talk about 
fear, and I've heard you suggest vigilance. But, I can't abide by guns. 
I told you the Lord will provide . . . I'll leave it there."

  For a long, awkward moment nobody spoke. For the second time in one
night, Bill had been embarrassed in his home. All were embarrassed.
Little by little, the visitors excused themselves and thanked Bill
for having them. After they left, Bill sat alone in his apartment and 
thought about moving.

                              *  *  *

  Rumors of Martha's generosity were circulating among the gangmembers.
They said Jennings House was full of wealthy people, wallets and safes 
full of cash and jewels. 
  
  For over a year, the opposing forces had engaged in a running-battle 
that frustrated law enforcement. Their criminal acts were independent of 
each other, but their timing and brutality often coincided, perplexing
police. For instance, within minutes of the grocery store robbery the 
police received word of a drive-by shooting blocks away. With one patrol 
already dispatched to the market, another was needed at the shooting.
While these patrolmen were involved, a third call came from three blocks 
in the opposite direction: a multiple murder with wounded.
              
  An officer was summoned by Bill, to give advice on their Neighborhood
Watch program, "The pattern's well established, and law enforcement is 
strained in its efforts to protect and serve," said the patrolman. "What 
with crime on the rise -- well, we can't be every place at once." 

  "You know it's the gangs, right?" Bill Hanson prompted the officer.
"Why don't you just arrest them all?"

  "Without reliable information, little can be done," officer Danielson
said, looking a little bewildered at the suggestion. Turning to Martha, 
he added, "You could hire private security, Mrs. Jennings. They could be 
here round-the-clock and offer protection for all you folks."

  Martha rejected the idea, despite the urgings of the patrolman and Bill.

  "But Martha, listen to reason," Bill implored her. "Officer Danielson,
please tell her."

  "The gangs in the area are about to get busy, Mrs. Jennings. The 
information we've been able to gather indicates they're about to have a 
major confrontation, and your building will be in the battle zone."

  Martha's moist brown eyes reminded Danielson of a deer frozen in its 
tracks, facing an oncoming semi, transfixed by light and unaware of its 
predicament.

  "The streets are your matter," Martha began, looking blissful and
committed, "and this house is the Lord's." That ended her involvement in 
the conversation; she turned and walked away, reciting the Lord's prayer.

   "Yeah, right. The meek will inherit the earth," Danielson muttered to
Bill, "a six-by-six plot."

                              *  *  *

  Mobilized in neighborhood watch fashion, they manned the apartments 
facing streets and alleys, reasoning those would be the first to witness 
any assault on the building. Fire equipment was inspected and tested.

  Still, they were not prepared to do anything to defend themselves. If 
anybody beside Bill had a firearm, they didn't mention it. The Watch kept 
in close contact with law enforcement; they were told of any and all gang 
movement, but nothing substantial occurred.
                   
  Martha had not participated in the watch, the tenants made it a point 
to visit her every day. She didn't agree with their actions, "I know you 
folks mean well," she remarked to Evelyn, "but it's unnecessary."

  Later that night it happened.

   The police were alerted to a rampage by arsonists, ten-blocks from 
Jennings House. Minutes later, observers reported a gang war erupting 
seven blocks to the north. A few minutes later, police were summoned to 
an abandoned factory to the south, another suspected case of arson. In 
less than an hour, the section of city surrounding Jennings House was 
involved in fire and violence.

  No patrols were available when members of the two gangs began their 
combat just outside Jennings House. The warring factions now used guns 
as clubs -- almost useless without bullets. With knives and other make-
shift weapons the Flow battled the Blades in for the right to take the 
prize: Jennings House.

  Bill crouched by his street-front window watching the onslaught, he was
mesmerized by the violence and brutality. When it seemed one group was 
winning over the other, he ran out into the hall with his pistol and cried 
out to the residents to be on the defense.

  No one responded.

  Bounding up the steps toward Martha's apartment, he slipped and fell.
Bouncing half-way down the first flight of stairs, dazed, he tried to 
stand, and found his legs tangled in the spindles of the banister. "Oh, 
shit," he mumbled between swelling lips, "oh, God."  He had dropped his 
gun and could see it at the base of the stairs -- then -- the lights 
went out.

  The front door came crashing in and Bill was near unconscious. During 
his fall, his head had hit a number of steps. Through the darkness of the 
hall and thickening fog in his head, he made out a group of people 
standing in the doorway, silhouetted by the streetlights.

  "Help me, Jesus," he whimpered, unable to move. "Oh, Lord! Please help 
me," he cried.

  The group began to enter the house. A chant of "Blood will *Flow*!" 
echoed in his aching head.

  "Be at peace," a vaguely familiar voice said in his ear. Bill wasn't 
startled by the voice. Shock had detached him from his surroundings.
Where he had earlier felt anxiety, pain, and self pity, there was now 
rest and an odd sense of security. In his addled brain, he accepted he 
was going to die, and God's angel was ready to collect his soul.

  All he could do was laugh weakly.

  "What the hell is that!" a gang member cried, pointing to a dimly 
glowing form descending the steps. It looked vaguely human, but unnatural, 
just the same.

  "Whoever the hell it is, it's DEAD!" their leader challenged, running
forward to attack it with a length of pipe.

  At the bottom of the stairs, the two came together. To those near the
door, it seemed as if the vague figure crumpled to the floor. Laughing 
and whooping, the wolves streamed forward to their champion to give
congratulations to their leader.

  Without warning, the pipe was being used against them! The first two 
never knew what hit them. The cheers of the others became fearful howls 
amid sickening sounds of splitting skulls and crunching bones. Facing 
them was no longer their leader, but a homicidal maniac, with eyes glowing 
red and a voice foreign to them. He savagely caved-in heads, until those 
remaining fell back to the doorway and regrouped.

  "This is `The House of the Lord'!" the unearthly voice boomed. In the 
darkness, the blood covered leader picked up Bill's gun and fired a round 
at the entrance. Those remaining scattered to the street.

  "HE WHO LIVES BY THE SWORD SHALL DIE BY THE SWORD!" the voice intoned,
firing the remaining rounds toward anyone moving. Lifeless bodies hit the
street.

  "PREPARE YE THE WAY OF THE LORD!" the ominous voice declared, from the
doorway. Throwing the pistol out into the street, the body shook violently 
then fell down the landing to the sidewalk. Where the body had stood, a 
ghostly image remained erect in the doorway, Bill could barely make it out.

  The gang leader shook his head, as he got to his feet. He turned to the
doorway, transfixed by the spirit -- as if listening to it -- and finally 
charged down the sidewalk, screaming and running into the night.

  "I'm in shock. That's it," Bill reasoned to himself, as he watched the
after-image shimmering as it moved toward him. He wondered, "Maybe it's 
time for me to die."

  "You will be well," it said to him, as it slowly dissipated. "But, you 
and I have much to do." Bill passed out.


                              *  *  *

  When the police arrived, they were shocked at the scene. For a hundred 
yards on either side of Jennings House, the street and sidewalks were 
littered with bodies of gangmembers. One thing confused all who surveyed
the scene: there were no signs of blood or struggle on any of the bodies
found near Jennings House.

  Martha met Danielson at the door of the house and welcomed him in. He 
declined the invitation to her apartment, choosing to question her there.
"I need to talk to all the residents about what's happened," he said.

  "Then you'll want to come upstairs," she implored, gently taking
him by the arm and walking him upstairs.

  Once he entered the apartment, he found everyone was there; even Bill, 
who was lying on Martha's couch. "What happened here?" the policeman asked.

  "I fell down the stairs and hit my head," Bill remarked, wincing at the 
pain and grinning slightly. "Tripped over my own two feet."

  "What happened outside?" Danielson asked.

  "I couldn't tell you," replied Bill. I was coming upstairs to warn the 
others and then -- pow! Out like a light. When I came to, I was here."

  "We know the power and phones went out," Danielson said to Martha.
"Who was watching the action in the street? I'll need to know what you
folks saw." 

  Martha told him, but he refused to believe it. Consequently, he  
interviewed each and every man, woman, and child.

  Finishing his investigation, he thanked them for their cooperation. 
"No need to see me to the door," he told Martha, "I know the way."

  The Watch Commander questioned him at length on the accuracy of his 
report, Danielson vehemently defended his investigation. "Just look at 
the facts, sir. Nowhere in the house or just outside, did I or any other 
officers find any indications of struggle, and -- not ONE drop of blood! 
The crime scene photos will bear-out the report. The gangs butchered each 
other in the street. But not in or around the Jennings House. Case closed."

  "You're telling me nobody saw *anything*?" queried the captain, shaking 
his head. "I'd say that was impossible!"

  "None of 'em saw anything, and wouldn't budge on their stories -- not 
even the kids."

  "Dismissed," was the superior's last remark. Danielson left the room 
knowing the explanation wasn't satisfactory, but what could they do?
All the dead belonged to one gang or the other, and all the fingerprints
on weapons corresponded to the bodies -- including the leader of the Flow.
He had apparently committed suicide a few blocks away from Jennings House.
A note found in his shirt pocket, in his hand writing, stated he had been 
"possessed" and it made him kill his followers, then himself. 

  All the residents of Jennings House had told him the same thing. But, 
Danielson kept hearing Martha Jennings' words in his head, and would for
some time to come.

  "We were praying to the Lord to deliver us from evil," she said with 
clear, unwavering eyes and firm voice, "and he heard our prayers. The Lord 
looks after his sheep, officer." He recalled how she paused for a long 
moment, then finished her statement, "Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord."

THE STORY OF THE DRAGONS OF GEMS:

-ASTINUS OF PALANTHAS

	FRODRICK WAS ONE OF THE HIGH OGRES OF KRYNN THAT WERE CALLED IRDA.  IN
THE PAST, HE CAME TO ME LOOKING FOR A JOB BECAUSE HE WAS A PRIEST OF GILEAN AND
ONE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRIESTS OF GILEAN IS TO SERVE A LIBRARY, COURT,
OR OTHER SIMILAR PLACE.  I OFFERED HIM ONE AS A SCRIBE AND RESEARCHER FOR ME.
I SOON CAME TO LEARN THAT HE WAS ALSO A GREAT MAGIC-USER AND EXTRAORDINARILY
INTELLIGENT.
	ONE DAY HE WAS GOING THROUGH ONE OF THE MANY BOOKS IN MY LIBRARY WHEN
HE STUMBLED ON SOMETHING THAT CAUSED A STROKE OF GENIUS IN HIM.  HE WAS READING
ABOUT THE GRAYGEM.  "THE GEM ALTERED EVERYTHING IT CAME IN CONTACT WITH."
HE HAD A STROKE OF GENIUS.  HE TOLD ME, "WHAT ABOUT THE DRAGONS?"  I PONDERED
UPON THIS AND I REALLY HAD NO IDEA.  THE GREAT MAGE FISTANDANTILUS GAVE ME THE
DEVICE OF PRESENT TIME PASSING RIGHT BEFORE THE DWAFGATE WARS ( 39 AC ),AND THE
THE TIME OF THE GRAYSTONE WAS AROUND 3100 PC.  ALMOST EVERYTHING BEFORE THE WAR
I HAD TO DO MY OWN MANUAL RESEARCH TO FIND OUT.  SO I TOLD HIM TO GO ON AND FIND
OUT FOE HIMSELF.  THE ISLAND OF THE IRDAFOLK IS PART OF THE DRAGON ISLES CHAIN, 
SO I FELT THAT HE WOULD BE THE BEST MAN FOT THE JOB ANYWAY.  
SO HE MADE HIS PREPARATIONS AND WAS OFF ON HIS WAY.  ONE OF THE GIFTS TO IRDA
IS THE ABILITY TO SHAPECHANGE INTO ANY HUMANOID FORM THEY KNOW.  HE FIRST
CHANGED INTO A KYRIE, A RACE OF WINGED BIRD-MEN, AND FLEW TO THE NORTHERN TIP
OF THE CAPE OF NORDMARR.  NEXT, HE CHANGED INTO THAT OF A TRITON AND SWAM OVER
TO JAENTARTH, ONE OF THE MAGICAL DRAGON ISLES.  ON IT FRODRICK FOUND A COLONY
OF SHADOWPEOPLE.  IN ORDER TO GAIN THEIR FULL TRUST, HE SHAPECHANGED INTO ONE
OF THEIR KIND.  WITH MUCH DIGGING, HE FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A LEGEND OF
THEIRS:  THEIR IS AN ISLAND NEARBY THAT IS SURROUNDED BY A GRAY MIST.  THEY 
SAID THAT ONLY A FOLLOWER OF GILEAN, THE BOOK OF KNOWLEGE, COULD ENTER IT.
IT WAS THEN THAT FRODRICK REVEALED TO THEM HIS TRUE IDENTITY.  THEY REALIZED
THAT THE LEGEND MUST BE TRUE.  THEY TOLD FRODRICK WHERE THE ISLAND WAS TO BE
FOUND.  HE BID THEM FAREWELL AND WAS OFF ON HIS WAY.  HIS QUEST MUST WAIT, THIS
WAS A PRIME OPPROTUNITY FOR HIM TO FUTHER HIS ETHOS.  LITTLE DID HE KNOW THAT
HE WAS DOING BOTH AT ONCE.  
	HE FINALLY MADE IT TO THE THE MIST.  HE AND ONLY HE COULD SEE PAST THE
MIST, THOUGH.  HE SAW TEN GARGANTUAN, MOUNTAIN-LIKE FORMS COMING OUT OF THE
WATER.  THEY WERE ALL IN THE SHAPES OF BEAUTIFUL GEM-CARVED STATUES OF DRAGONS!
THERE WERE TWO OF EACH TYPE: CRYSTAL, TOPAZ, EMERALD, SAPHIRE, AND, THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL OF ALL, SAPHIRE. FRODRICK WALKED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THEM ALL AND 
CLUTCHED THE GRAY MEDALLION AT HIS NECK: THE MEDALLION OF GILEAN.  IT GLOWED A
BRILLIANT GRAY AND SOON SURROUNDED THE ENTIRE CIRCLE OF DRAGON-STATUES WITH THE
LIGHT OF KNOWLRGE.  THE STATUES STARTED TO MOVE!  THEN, THEY ALL IN TURN CAME
TO LIFE!  FRODRICK DROPPED TO HIS KNEES IN REVERENCE.  THE GREAT MALE AMETHYST
DRAGON APPROACHED FRODRICK AND SAID, "ARISE FRODRICK."
	FRODRICK ROSE AND REPLIED, "HOW?  WHY?"
	"WHEN THE GRAYGEM WAS RELEASED THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENED WAS THE 
BONDING OF THE SOULS OF THE DRAGONS OF KRYNN.  THE WHITE AND BRASS DRAGON'S
SOULS CAME TOGETHER TO FORM THE CRYSTAL DRAGONS.  THE BLACK AND COPPER'S CAME
TOGETHER TO FORM THE TOPAZ DRAGONS.  THE GREEN AND BRONZE'S CAME TOGETHER TO
FORM THE EMERALD DRAGONS.  THE BLUE AND SILVER'S CAME TOGETHER TO FORM THE 
SAPPHIRE DRAGONS.  AND THE RED AND GOLD'S CAME TOGETHER TO FORM THE AMETHYST
DRAGONS.  THE ORIGINAL DRAGONS ON KRYNN - THE CHROMATIC AND METALLIC DRAGONS -
WERE TAKHISIS' AND PALADINE'S GIFTS TO KRYNN; THEREFORE, FOR US GEM DRAGONS TO
COME TO LIFE, WE HAD TO HAVE THE DIRECT BLESSINGS OF GILEAN, THE PATRIARCH OF
THE GODS OF NEUTRALITY.  THROUGH YOU, JUST NOW, GILEAN HAS GIVEN US HIS
BLESSINGS OF LIFE AND KNOWLEGE.  WE ARE THE NEUTRAL DRAGONS. BY GIVING US LIFE,
YOU HAVE TRULY PLEASED GILEAN.  HE HAS TOLD ME TO GIVE YOU TWO GREAT GIFTS:
1.) I WILL GIVE YOU ONE OF THE GREATEST POWERS OF THE MIND. PSIONICS.
2.) I WILL ACCOMPANY YOU WHEREVER YOU GO AND BE YOUR AID AND PROTECTOR FOR 
GILEAN HAS MADE YOU HIS CHOSEN ONE TO FURTHER HIS CHURCH."
	AND SO FRODRICK AND MAKHIKAN, THE GREAT AMETHYST DRAGON, TRAVELED BACK
TO ME.  TOGETHER THEY BUILT ONTO MY LIBRARY A GREAT TEMPLE AND COURT. AND NOW
FRODRICK, STARMASTER OF GILEAN, HAS FULLFILLED THE PROPHECY OF THE DRAGONS OF
THE GEMS....-....=========================================================================================

(C) 1992 Kimberly Ann Carter

		"Win big, Momma's fallen angel,
		 Lose big, livin' out her lies,
		 Wants it all, Momma's fallen angel,
		 Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life ..."

					-- Fallen Angel
					    * Poison *


	Crystal leaned heavily against the open door to the
refrigerator, peering into the brightly lit interior, wondering which
bowlful of leftovers had the least chance of killing her.  She finally
decided on the leftover pizza -- cheese and sausage, and chocolate
milk -- the carton was still half full.  She kicked the fridge door
shut, and stood in front of the oak wood cabinets, debating on whether
or not she needed a plate.  Shrugging, she dismissed the idea, elbowed
the kitchen light off and headed for the dark living room.

	She tripped over an amplifier that sat on the living room
floor as she fumbled for the light switch.  Finally, the track
lighting leapt to life, and Crystal eye-balled the room with a
grimace.

	Scores of sheet music littered the room.  Some of it was
wadded up into little balls, some of it was crumpled, but it was
mainly strewn everywhere.  Compact Discs, records, and tapes were
scattered over the top of the oak bar, along with some half-empty
glasses, pens, pencils, an electric pencil sharpener, a set of
headphones, an amp hook up, earrings, a Dodgers baseball cap and a
bra.  Phone numbers taped to the entertainment center added a colorful
clash to the pile of socks next to the large Roland Keyboard component
unit that sat in the middle of the living room floor.  A hand-held
synthesizer lay on the black sectional, wires winding out into the
unknown.  High-heeled boots, and a pair of high-top gym shoes were
scattered under the glass coffee table.  Magazines occupied one black
velour chair while newspapers occupied another.

	"I'm gonna have to clean this place up sometime," she thought
to herself.  She tried to recall what the carpeting looked like and
failed.

	"Soon," she said out loud to noone.  She elbowed the light
switch again, deciding to eat in her bedroom, knowing for a fact she
had a better chance of making it back out in one piece.  As the light
clicked off enshrouding the mess in darkness, she tripped towards the
bedroom.

	"What a difference," she though as the bedroom lights came on. 
"I can see the floor and _feel_ the carpeting!"  A king-size bed,
piled high with pillows sat against the far wall.  Each pillow,
encased with either a pink or black sham matched the large black and
pink comforter on the bed.  Heavy black curtains hung from the huge
picture window.  Two black dresses accented with silver, and an ebony
lounge chair took up the bulk of the room.  A large hat stand, holding
an array of many different kinds of hats sat next to the open door to
the walk-in closet.  Through another door, Crystal could see the pink
tile of the bathroom floor.

	Glancing at the dresser top, she tried to avert her eyes from
the enormous pile of mail that had accumulated there.  Frowning, she
put her milk down, scooped up the mail and went over to her bed.  She
grimaced at the slight pain in her chest.  Ignoring it, she flopped
down and began reading through the mail as she munched her pizza.  It
took a while to make a dent in all the bills, junk mail, fan letters,
invitations, and catalogs.  When she was about halfway through, the
phone rang.  She glanced at the digital alarm clock on her nightstand
next to the phone.  The time read 12:23 a.m.

	"Time means nothing to musicians," she thought to herself. 
Reaching for the phone, she again felt the pain.  Why did she feel
like she was forgetting something?

	"Hello," she said, stating rather than asking.

	"Crystal?  Why in the hell haven't you called me back?"
bellowed a scratchy, deep, Bronx accented voice on the other end.

	Crystal raised an eyebrow.  "Rip, is that you?" she inquired.

	"Who the hell else would it be?" he growled.

	"I dunno, maybe someone NICE." she said icily.  "What is your
problem anyway?"  She could see the 6' 3" guitar player in her mind,
probably smoking a cigarette, and running his long fingers through his
shoulder-length black hair.

	"Rumor has it you're gonna start working at home," Rip's voice
dropped about 20 decibels and took on a kinder tone.  "The pain that
bad?"

	Crystal looked down at the half-eaten slice of pizza before
she tossed it onto the nightstand and wiped her hands on her jeans.

	"What pain?" she forced her voice to remain calm.  She glanced
at her dresser top again and saw the prescription bottle.  Damn! 
That's what she forgot.

	"Jack Miller tells me you've been having a rough time at the
studio."

	The pain in Crystal's chest caused her to grit her teeth.

	"Jack don't know shit."

	"Crystal --"

	"Look Rip, I'm fine."  It was a dull throbbing pain now, and
Crystal made a mental note to kick herself in the ass for not taking
her pill.

	"Have you thought of maybe taking some time off -- Cancer is
some pretty serious --"

	"Rip, it's not that bad!"

	"Bullshit!  And Jack says you won't even give Chemotherapy a
try."

	"I'm not going to waste my time, Rip."  She got up and began
pacing the floor.  "The doctors say I have a 2% chance of survival. 
Small Cell Anaplastic Carcinoma is _deadly_, Rip."

	"Well, that 2% --"

	"I like my hair -- thank you!" she interrupted.  She ran her
fingers through her auburn hair feeling the different lengths in it's
shag cut.  "Rip, if I'm going to die, I want my hair!"

	"You might not die if you take chemo..."

	"NO!!"

	"Just try it -- take a break from the rat race for a few --"

	"Rip, music is my life," she whispered as she looked at
herself in the mirror on her dresser, her hazel eyes brimming with
unshed tears.  The pain in her chest intensified and she fought to
keep her voice even.  "I can't give it up.  I won't give it up," she
said harshly.

	"I know," his voice sounding shaky, "but you're going to die
if you don't try something."

	"I'm going to die anyway."  A single tear slid down her high
cheek bones, her shapely lips twisted into a scowl.  "I'm going to go
down fighting Rip," her voice edged with razors.  "I have an album to
complete and I only have 3 1/2 months to do it.  I have come too far,
worked too hard to quit NOW!"  She squeezed her eyes shut to block out
the pain surging through her.

	"Crystal." there was a pause, "Crystal?"

	Crystal opened her eyes, the pain, reaching new heights,
caused her to feel dizzy.  She staggered forward, losing her balance. 
She hit her temple on the corner of the dresser with a sickening
crack.  She crumpled, black phone still in hand, the black carpeting
rising to meet her, enfold her, welcome her.

	Blackness, and she knew no more.

	Darkness .... Voices .... Whispering .... So cold ...

	"Drrinkk..."

	Far away....

	"Drrinkk..."

	"Hot...  So hot...  Burning!  I'm Burning!" Crystal's mind
screamed.  "Acid -- pouring down my throat!"  She could feel scorching hot
fluid overflow down her cheeks... Her insides shriveling as the liquid made
contact with her internal organs.  She could see her skin blackening,
cracking under the intense heat.  Hair singed down to the very roots.  Body
engulfed in flames, melting... melting...

                           *   *   *   *   *   *

	Crystal slowly opened her eyes to find Michel standing over her. 
She looked down to see she had her nails dug into his arm -- blood flowing
from a gash on his wrist, spilling on the sheets, spattering her hospital
gown...

	"What the hell?" she thought, pushing his arm away.  He smiled down
on her, laughter showing in his evergreen eyes.

	"So much blood..." she whispered as she ran her tongue around the
inside of her mouth -- where a coppery, salty taste still remained.  She
felt so weak... so tired...  Her eyes drooped.

	"Sleep well love," she heard his French accent soothing her.  "For
you have quite a journey ahead..."  She felt his lips brush hers, and then
once again the soothing dark enveloped her.

                           *   *   *   *   *   *

	Crystal sat straight up in bed.  "God!  What a nightmare!" she
thought -- and then reality hit her.

	She was in a hospital!  Her hand flew to her forehead where a gauze
bandage was taped.  The material felt funny under her fingers.  "Well, at
least the pain in my chest is gone," she thought as she threw back the
covers.  She looked down at her arm where an I.V. ran to a bottle on a
stand.  "Enough of this shit," she thought as she ripped the I.V. from her
hand.  She was hungry, and wanted a REAL meal by God!  The thought of a
steak dinner crossed her mind and she smiled...  "Nice and rare," she
thought.  As she climbed out of bed, two doctors and a nurse burst into the
room.

	"And where do you think you're going?" questioned one of the
doctors.  He was young, handsome, and out of breath.

	"Miss Dawn, please get back in bed!" said the older doctor firmly. 
He had a beefy hand on Crystal's arm, and she noticed he was balding. 
"Something sure smells good," she thought.  "Wonder what they're cooking in
the cafeteria..."

	"Look doll, I feel fine, got a terrific hunger pang though," she
said, removing the bandage on her head.

	"Miss Dawn, you have been through a terrible ordeal since you were
admitted two nights ago --" began the young doctor.

	"Two nights ago??  Jesus Christ!  That's how long I've been out?!"

	"Not only out, but you flatlined once during that period.  We had
done everything we could to think of to save you, but nothing worked -- at
least at first."  He shifted uncomfortably.

	"You should consider yourself lucky to be alive young lady," nodded
the old doctor.

	Crystal's mind flashed to Michel.  "I am, I do, but I feel great --
 I haven't felt this good in ages."

	The nurse adjusted the pillows.  "That's fine but you need to
rest."

	"I NEED DINNER!!" Crystal growled.

	"All right -- I'll send dinner up to you if you promise to get back
into bed," pushed the young doctor.

	"But I --"

	"Now!  Nurse Crawford, stay with her till I get back."  The young
doctor turned to his elder.  "This is the damnedest thing..." thier voices
became unintelligible outside the room's door.

	Crystal inhaled deeply.  She couldn't understand but something
smelled good enough to eat.  Crystal turned towards the nurse.  She could
hear Nurse Crawford's blood flowing through her, her heart pumping blood...

	"Let me get you another blanket out of the closet -- you feel kind
of cold..." said the nurse as she opened the closet.  Crystal could see her
clothes hanging inside.  She looked down at her hospital gown and a vision
of it being blood spattered rose unbidden from her mind.  She frowned and
shook her head.  She had to get out of here, and fast!  Screw dinner here -
- she'd grab a burger from McDonald's!

	"Nurse, hand me my clothes," she demanded, and began untying the
gown.

	"Miss Dawn, I though we were through with that -- now get back in
the bed!"

	Crystal walked towards the closet.  "I want my clothes," she said
loudly.

	"No!  The doctor said --"

	"Fuck the doctor!  I said I want my clothes -- now!"

	Crystal reached out to push the nurse away, and realized what had
smelled so good -- it was Nurse Crawford.  "Give me my clothes, before you
really piss me off!"  Crystal felt a pricking sensation in her mouth.  Her
eyes flashed.  She was very angry and absolutely starving...

	"If you don't get back in the bed, I'm calling --"

	The nurse didn't have a chance to finish.  Crystal grabbed her arms
in a crushing grip, and sank her fangs into the nurse's neck...

Hey everyone,

	This letter includes Tears of Glass, Chapter 4.  I
	recently sent out a message asking whether anyone had
	seen the previous chapter, referring to it as "Tears
	of a Toreador."  That was a working title that was used
	with the first chapter, but not the subsequent ones.
	I typed it accidentally -- the real title is "Tears of
	Glass."

	Tears of Glass contains some language which "may be
	considered unsuitable for younger and more sensitive"
	readers, but, again, I somehow think that won't be a
	problem.  Lemme know whatcha think about the story.




                         Tears of Glass 
                            Chapter 4

(C) 1992 Kimberly Ann Carter

                "And the walls came down,
                 All the way to hell,
                 Never saw them where they standing,
                 Never saw them when they fell..."

				-- Tweeter and the Monkey Man
                                     * The Travelling Wilburys *

	Crystal felt warm blood gush between her teeth, tasted
it's coppery saltiness.  As soon as she swallowed, her hunger and
anger subsided.  Nurse Crawford jerked angrily away, a small
bruise on her neck.

	"Damn musicians!" she shouted as she back-peddled towards
the door, keeping her eyes on Crystal the entire time.  "You
Rockers especially -- you're all ... weird!"  She ran from the
room.

	"What the hell is the matter with me?" Crystal questioned
as she pulled off the hospital gown.  "I've been pissed off
before, but never angry enough to bite someone..."  She pulled
her blue jeans from the closet and put them on.  "And what's
really gross... is it tasted... good!  Oh yuck.  I can't believe
I'm thinking this way, must be losing it..."  She grabbed her
boots and sat down on the bed.  As soon as she did, she
remembered the nightmare about Michel.  His handsome face swam
before her eyes.  "Damn him!  What happened to him!"  Crystal
chewed her lower lip and pulled a boot on.  "That bastard!"  She
pulled on the other boot, hard enough to hurt.  "I trust him;
tell him I'm dying, and what does the creep do?  Up and leaves!" 
Crystal stamped back to the closet, put on her half-shirt and
pulled her leather out, gritting her teeth.  She struggled into
her biker's jacket, mad at herself for dreaming about him.

	Shouldering her purse, she peeked down the brightly lit
hallway, which just happened to be empty, for the moment anyway. 
Quietly, she let herself out -- walking on tip toes so her three-
inch heels wouldn't click.  She headed towards a door marked
"Stairs."

                           *   *   *   *   *   *

	"I'm just thinkin' screwy because of the lump on my
noggin'" she reasoned as she rounded the landing to the fifth
floor.  "I can't believe I bit that nurse -- a person would be
thought crazy..."

	A face was staring at her through the window of the 6th
floor door.  Large brown eyes pleaded with her hazel eyes, while
a gentle rapping urged her to open the door.  She put her hand to
the knob, turned it and freed...

	A geek.

	A very tall geek.

	In a hospital gown.

	With wild brown hair, long fingers, and a Norman Bates
smile.

	"Great.  Just great." she thought.  "Maybe if I ignore
it, it'll go away..."

	Crystal walked around him and continued down the stairs
... and he followed.  She increased her pace a bit ... and he
matched it.  She remembered all the movies about raving lunatics
she had seen over the last 10 years.  Weren't they always kept on
the fifth floor in the movies??

	Between the third and second floor Crystal stopped so
abruptly that he stepped on her with his bare feet.

	"Something I can help you with?" she asked coolly.  Her
hands crammed into the pockets of her leather.

	"Well, uh,..." stammered the geek.  "Hi!"

	Crystal rolled her eyes.  He really looked geeky -- the
hospital gown was a bit big in the sleeves -- it pooled around
his hips, and flared out at the knees.  "With those big brown
eyes he looks like a Holly Hobbie reject," Crystal thought.

	He smiled at her with that demonic grin.  Holly Hobbie -
with an axe...  "My name is Fred," he offered, and extended his
hand.

	Crystal looked at his hand for a second, looked him in
the eye, and shook hands with him.  Well, at least his palm
wasn't sweaty...  "Crystal," she said dryly.  "Crystal Dawn."

	"Where you going?" he questioned as he tilted his head to
one side.

	"Oh yeah, a screwball -- definitely."  Crystal closed her
eyes.  "What person in their right frame of mind asks a question
like that?"

	"Home," she replied, taking another step down the stairs. 
Fred maneuvered in front of her.

	"Where's home?"

	Crystal inhaled deeply and counted to 10.  "Fred, why do
you care?"

	"Just curious."

	"Oh."  He still blocked her path.  She cleared her
throat.  He stood grinning down at down at her.  She stood
staring at the wall.  After about a minute, Crystal threw up her
hands.  "What do you want from me??" she blurted.

	Fred sighed.  "I want you to help me leave." he said like
she should have guessed.

	"Me -- help you leave?!" she shouted.

	"Don't yell --"

	"You don't know me from Adam!" she whispered fiercely at
him.

	"I need to leave...." he said softly.  "Please."

	Crystal leaned on the banister.  She thought about Nurse
Crawford and the doctors, how they had tried to make her stay. 
For all she knew, they were starving him too.  All right, he was
a nerd with a real psychotic grin.  He was probably harmless; her
imagination probably was working overtime.  The fifth floor was
probably a private floor... The chances of him being crazy seemed
mighty slim...  After all, this is reality -- shit like that only
happens in the movies...  "All right, I'll help you if I can."

	"Great!"  He sounded relieved.

	"Look, wait here..."  Crystal headed down the stairs to
the second floor.  "I'll see if I can get you some clothes."

	Fred followed her to the door.  "You will come back..." 
He began looking frightened.

	"Yes, I'll come back."  She smiled at him.

	"Promise?"

	"I promise, Fred..."  She patted his arm, slunk through
the door, and was gone...

                           *   *   *   *   *   *

	After doing a quick search of the floor, Crystal found
the doctor's personal lockers, jimmied one open with a nail file,
and pulled out street clothes, a wallet, and some car keys.  She
took all the cash out of the wallet, except $20 -- "He's going to
need cab fare..." she said aloud as she fingered the keys to his
Jeep.  She scanned through his wallet, got his license plate
number, and returned the wallet.  She closed the locker softly
and crept back down the hallway to the stairwell...

                           *   *   *   *   *   *

	Fred was nowhere to be seen.  "Fred?" she whispered
loudly.  "Fred!"

	"Up here --" a voice called from the landing above.

	Crystal climbed the stairs and found Fred standing over
the unconscious body of a nurse.

	"What the hell?"  Crystal inquired with annoyance.

	"She was gonna yell, so I knocked her out..."

	"Here."  Crystal threw the clothes to Fred and turned her
back.  The car keys felt cool in her hand.  "You need a ride
somewhere?"

	"That'd be great!  Thanks so much, I --"

	"Fred?"

	"Yes Crystal?"

	"Shut up."

                           *   *   *   *   *   *

	Fred and Crystal found the Jeep without trouble, got in
and drove out of the hospital.

	"Piece of cake," Crystal stated.  "I was surprised we
weren't questioned or stopped.  You want to tell me where I'm
taking you?"

	Fred stared off into space.

	"Fred?"  No response.  "Yo, Fred?!"

	"Huh?"

	"Where am I drivin' you?"  Crystal smiled and shook her
head.

	"I was just remembering a dream," he told her.

	"Fred - I don't --"

	"Do you have dreams?"

	Crystal gripped the steering wheel hard enough to make
her knuckles white.  "No." she said forcefully.  "I don't."

	"Well I do, and I just had a dream about --"

	"Fred?"

	"Yes Crystal?"

	"Shut up."

	"Crystal?"

	"What?"

	"Why were you in the hospital?"

	Crystal was quiet for a moment.  "I was visiting my
sister," she lied.

	"Oh."

	"Why were you in the hospital?"

	"I don't know," was Fred's reply.  "You look familiar."

	"I do?"

	"Uh huh -- wait, don't tell me -- I'll guess," Fred said
enthusiastically.  "Were you on --"  A wail from a siren cut off
Fred's sentence.  A police car appeared in Crystal's rear-view
mirror.

	"SHIT!"  Crystals foot hit the gas and the Jeep shot
forward.  They headed south on Lake Shore Drive, Navy Pier a
short ways in the distance.  For the time of night there was
little traffic, and Crystal's foot got ten pounds heavier.  Fred
held on for his life.

	"What are we going to do?" he yelled over the siren.

	Crystal looked around quickly.  She could see a lot of
people milling around Navy Pier, where a huge boat had been
docked.  It seemed to be an old pirate ship of sorts.  She
checked her rear-view mirror again.  They were gaining.

	"Fred, do you see all the people at the pier?"

	"Yeah."

	"Do you think we could lose the cops in a crowd?"

	"I don't know -- it works on T.V."

	Crystal rolled her eyes.  "I'm going to stop the car, and
when I do, get out and run for the crowd, got it?"

	Fred glanced back over his shoulder, looked at Crystal
and nodded.

	"All right, hang on!"  Crystal pushed the pedal to the
floor, and Fred braced himself.  As soon as she gained some
ground, she threw the Jeep in park, dropping the transmission in
the middle of Lake Shore Drive.  Gears ground and metal screamed,
but the Jeep stopped.

	Crystal and Fred jumped from the Jeep and began running
towards the pier.  Crystal heard the screech of tires and looked
back.  They were heading towards the pier as well.  She noticed
that the crowd was here to see the boat, so she bought two
tickets, and, grabbing Fred, headed towards the ship.

	"We've got to lose them!" she said in his ear.

	Crystal looked around nervously.  Fred grabbed her hand
and said: "Look, there's a hole!"

	"Huh?"  Crystal looked.  Apparently, the ship had been
sunk, or had been grounded because there was a large hole towards
the back of the boat.  He led her to it and peered into the
darkness.

	"We could hide in there," he said, pointing at it.

	Crystal wrinkled her nose as she eyed the splintered
wood.  "I don't know Fred -- if they find us...."

	"They're going to find us for sure if we don't do
something!"

	"It's dark in there!"

	"Don't worry Crystal -- it'll be okay."  Fred stepped
over the rope guard.  Crystal followed more slowly.  The hole
looked like a big gaping mouth with lots of sharp teeth.

	Crystal took a deep breath, and while holding onto Fred's
hand tightly, she stepped into the hole, her hair standing on
end...  "This has not been my night..." Crystal murmured under
her breath.  "And the night's still young..."

	"What did you say?" asked Fred out loud.  His voice
bounced off the old wood, giving the sentence a slight echo.

	"Nothing."

	"Hey, there are stairs!" he told her.

	"Really?" Crystal thought.  Where?  Her eyes still hadn't
adjusted to the inky blackness yet.

	A board creaked behind them and Crystal froze.  She
clamped her free hand over Fred's mouth.  "Shhhh." she hissed.

	They stood for what seemed like hours, but no other
sounds gave away a location of a possible pursuer.

	Fred led Crystal down the stairs to a door, warped and
badly in need of repair.

	"Doesn't look like anyone's been down here in a while,"
Fred commented, and gave the door a push.

	Stale air, and the smell of decay.  "Got to love it..."
Crystal joked.  Fred turned to look at her.

	"You are sick."

	"I am not -- I was just trying to be funny."

	"You failed."

	"Oh."

	Fred stepped into the small room and immediately spied
something in the corner.  "Hey, do you see that?" he gestured.

	"No... wait... yeah... what is it?" she asked as he moved
towards it.

	"It looks like a body."

	Crystal was glad it was dark and was thankful Fred had
his back to her.  "A body?  Is that all?  Boring!  We should
leave..."  She took a step back.

	"Scared?"

	"Who me?"

	"Yeah."

	"No."

	"It's dead you know.  It can't hurt you."

	Crystal smiled weakly.  "Okay."

	"Help me move it.  It's stuck."

	Crystal blanched.  "Okay."  She numbly walked over to
where Fred was standing with a poker grin plastered to her face.

	"Here, you take his head," Fred motioned with his hand.

	"Right."  Crystal leaned down.  As she placed one hand on
the ship's wall for balance, she cut her hand on the splintering
wood.

	"Ouch."

	"Now what?"

	"Cut myself."  She grabbed her hand and squeezed.  She
was bleeding.  She could feel it run down her hand, off her
fingers to splash onto the face of....

	....the raving maniac who jumped up, ran to the doorway,
and proceeded to rip the throat out of a person standing there. 
Blood spurted everywhere, and as the young teenager who Fred
thought was a body began to drink the blood out of the throat of
his victim, Crystal fell to her knees.  "This is another bad
dream...  It has to be...  Shit like this doesn't happen..."  She
looked at Fred who was throwing up in a corner.

	After what seemed like a small eternity, the young man
dropped the body, and turned towards Crystal and Fred, his fangs
glistening with blood...
